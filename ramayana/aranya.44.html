<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 44<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama eliminates ṃāreecha when he is escaping beyond reach in the form of Golden Deer. He sports with that deer for a long time and
when it is leading him away and afar from the hermitage, he is vexed with the trickery of the deer and kills it. At the time of his death ṃāreecha
shouts out for Seetha and Lakshmana, as demanded by Ravana. Rama is perplexed at this oddity of ṃāreecha and presumes that some danger is immanent
and then returns to hermitage.</p>

<p class="comment">ṃāreecha would have died without yelling for Lakshmana or Seetha as tutored by Ravana because ṃāreecha is no real alley of
Ravana. But it is said that he 'recollected Ravana's words and thought about it.' What he really thought is the causation of death to that one who
caused his own death, namely Ravana. Ravana can do nothing to ṃāreecha now as ṃāreecha is breathing his last. Whatever is to be done now it has t
become a self-ruinous act to Ravana. Hence, it is better to do as said by Ravana for the elimination of Ravana. So thought ṃāreecha.</p>

When Rama's incomparable arrow has indeed shattered his crucial organ, namely the heart, in a downright manner, then ṃāreecha assumed

<p class="comment">Though ṃāreecha assumed the form of a deer he has to retain his heart and brain
of a demon. This is the yogic way of <em>para kāya praveshanam</em> 'entering other bodies.' These
assumed artificial bodies do not hold ground in <em>nidrā, surata, maraṇa dasheṣu</em> 'in sleep,
copulation and death states,' where the mind, if distracted to these states, cannot concentrate or
hold the body that is assumed by mental powers of yoga. Here no supernal god or deity is involved
to grant such a capacity but one's own practise achieves it. Whereas in other case like Ravana,
gods have bestowed boons, so he need not practise such yoga etc., as he is blessed to be above
these mortal's practises and thus can change his form and can rejoice in any state with that body
or form. This is how he abducts Seetha changing his semblances instantaneously.</p>

Fruits of listening ṃāreecha&#39;s legend
</p>

<p class="comment">
As with any other demon&#39;s death ṃāreecha&#39;s 
death also is eulogised as a merited one and reading or listening this is said to bring merit. 
Though these results are not said in Ramayana proper, its collateral scripts like
<em>skānda purana, ādhyātma rāmāyaṇa </em>etc., say them. For the 
elimination of ṃāreecha <em>ādhyātma rāmāyaṇa </em>says: 
</p>

<p class="smItṣ">
tat dehāt uddhitam tejaḥ sarva lokasya pashyataḥ |<br>
rāmam eva āvishat devāḥ vismayam paramam jaguḥ ||<br>

<p  class="comment">From that body of ṃāreecha a divine aureole 
risen while all the world is seeing... that merged into Rama alone, causing very great 
astonishment... this is the marvel of Rama, nothing else..&#39; So the divine beings thought seeing from 
heavens, and said &#39;a Brahman or a demon, or a sinner or meritorious one who cites the name of Rama 
at the time of leaving his body, he attains the Ultimate Threshold...&#39; Blessing so, the divine 
beings returned to their abodes on seeing the salvation of ṃāreecha&#39;s soul in Rama.&#39;
