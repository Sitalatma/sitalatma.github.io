<h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p class="txt">
 Vishnu agrees to incarnate as human and selects Dasharatha as his father.
          And when Dasharatha is performing the Vedic ritual called <font color=
          "#B3003A">putrakāmeṣṭi</font> a deity called <font color="#B3003A">prājāpatya
          purusha</font> arises from the sacrificial fire to give a golden vessel of divine dessert
          to Dasharatha for distribution among his queens to beget progeny. The three queens on
          consuming that dessert conceive their children.</p>

 This divine dessert is meant for the 'eligible' queens, as informed the Ritual
  Being and also in order to maintain the divinity of Ram's birth. In the context of seed and
  field, the field has no equal importance to the seed <em>bīja kshetra nyaya</em> . Hence the
  seed is divine in the form of dessert and fields are therefore shall 'be eligible' for the
  seedling. As such the First Queen and Empress Kausalya is being addressed firstly, and given
  firstly.</p>

 The king then gave half of the dessert to queen Kausalya, and he gave half of the

  one eight of the dessert, with a desire to beget sons. Then thinking for a while gave the
  remaining, i.e., one-eighth portion again to queen Sumitra. Thus, the king distributed the
  dessert to his wives differently. [1-16-27, 28, 29]</p>

 This is a much-discussed distribution by the traditionalists. Adhyatma
  Ramayana, a treatise that postulates god-hood to Rama, gives a well-constructed argument about
  these shares of dessert and the resultant births of the four brothers, viz., Rama, Lakshmana,
  Bharata, and Shatrughna, in accordance with these shares. In its simplest terms and as contained
  in these verses, queen Kausalya got half of the dessert as an Empress, <em>paṭṭa mahiṣi.</em>
  Sumitra gets one-fourth in the first round and after a rethink by Dasharatha, she gets another
  one-eighth portion. Kaikeyi gets only a one-eighth quantity. Thus, Kausalya gives birth to Rama,
  Sumitra to Lakshmana and Shatrughna, and Kaikeyi to Bharata. The quantum of apportionment of the
  dessert does not make Rama all-powerful or Bharata the least. Since the Absolute is indivisible
  into parts, the dessert that is divided is not to be taken as the divided Absolute, but a kind of
  medium through which the incarnation is made possible.</p>

  <div id="btn3" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
 There is another declination enquiring whether the incarnation of Rama is full
  or partial, <em>pūrṇa avatara</em> or <em>artha avatara...</em> Rama is Vishnu Himself while
  Bharata and Shatrughna are his disc and conch-shell, while Lakshmana is the thousand headed snake
  <em>ādi sesha</em> on whose coils Vishnu reclines. The whole dessert is divine and parts of it
  do not signify and inter-divided god-hoods. Hence, the apportionment of the desert is done in
  order to keep up the hierarchy of the queen-hoods and their status. Throughout this magnum opus
  Rama never said that he is god or an incarnate of god, but called himself, <em>nimitta
  mātra</em> a casual relation to the course of events. Should Rama be the incarnation of the
  Almighty Himself, he has little or no necessity to incarnate the weaponry along with him. They
  are at his beck and call at any time. Thus, Rama is neither a half nor one-fourth incarnation of
  the Absolute nor a dividend of the whole, but an incarnate of the virtuously ideal personality of
  Vishnu, <em>maryāda purushottama</em> Rama.</p>

  <div id="btn4" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
 Incidental to this apportionment of the dessert, the aspect of eldest son is
  also studied. Rama is the first-born and thus the eldest. This is because the dessert is given to
  queen Kausalya in the first instance, and half of the whole vessel. She immediately consumed to
  lionise her share and as an Empress. Sumitra waited a while till apportionment is complete.
  Kaikeyi got her portion but waited till her elder sister Sumitra completes her drink. In the
  meanwhile Dasharatha thought a while, as said in the verse, and gave Sumitra another one-eighth
  part. Sumitra then consumed her two parts. Later Kaikeyi drinks her dividend.</p>
