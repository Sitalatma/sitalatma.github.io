<p class="txt">
Tara appeases Lakshmana and reasons with him about the delay, which is held as delay by Rama, but in actuality 
it is the preparatory time lag. She gives an account o Ravana&#39;s forces that cannot be countered without proper 
assistance of Vanara military. She informs Lakshmana that all the Vanara forces are mobilized and they present 
themselves before Rama on this very day.</p>

In Bala Kanda the legend of Vishvamitra is there. And there his association with ṃenaka is narrated. Some say 
the ṃenaka and Ghritāchi are the same apsara-s. But others say that Ghritāchi is a separate apsara. Vishvamitra 
gives up even his daily routines <em>sandhya upāsana, nitya karma</em>, required of a Vedic sage, in all the 
ten years of his association with Ghritāchi.</p>

Rohini is one of the twenty-seven stars of Indian Astrology, commencing from <em>ashvani, bharaṇi, kṛittika, 
rohiṇi...</em> et al These are the daughters of Daksha Prajapati and wives of ṃoon. But the ṃoon is much interested 
in Rohini and used to neglect other twenty-six. Then all the twenty-six stars went to their father and complained, 
basing on which Daksha Prajapati issues a curse to ṃoon that he shall wane away. When his waning is beyond the 
reason, again the twenty-six stars have gone to their father and requested him to withdraw his curse. As an amendment 
to his curse Daksha says that the ṃoon shall wax for fifteen days and wane for the other fifteen days and the 
ṃoon shall take holy bath on no-moon day in one of the Holy Rivers, namely River Saraswati, now extinct, at a 
place called Prabhāsa. Then all the twenty-six other stars stopped interfering with the coalescence of ṃoon with 
Rohini.</p>

This military census is interpreted variously and in the above way it comes to &#39;one trillion thirty-nine thousand 
and six hundred; 1,000,000,399,600 plus many more in hundreds and thousands (?) However, the picture we get is 
that Lanka is a garrison of warriors, except for some sane citizens like Vibheeshana and his family, ṃandodari, 
Sulocana wt al. Apart from them there is an invaluable wealth amassed by Ravana. And there are many sages and 
women that are held captive in that island.</p>

On this verse some commentaries are having the meaning that &#39;Sugreeva cannot encounter those demons or Ravana, 
without any assistance of his forces...&#39; Rama never wanted Sugreeva to wage war but sought help from Sugreeva 
in searching Seetha. Tara is a little ahead in her thinking and narrating the military capabilities of Ravana, 
as heard from Vali. Thus her opinion according to Tilaka commentary is &#39;Sugreeva cannot eliminate Ravana single-handedly 
and without assistance, and when Rama needs Sugreeva&#39;s help, Sugreeva needs his military assistance consequentially, 
which is a possibility only after Vali&#39;s elimination.&#39; <em>visheṣataḥ sugrīveṇa </em>This verse is recorded in 
another method: <em>na ca shakyā raṇe hantum asahāyena rākshasāḥ | rāmeṇa kṛIra karmaṇaḥ sugrīva sahitena 
vai || </em>&#39;Rama cannot kill these many demons without assistance, more so Sugreeva. So Sugreeva summoned all 
his forces to assist him. Sugreeva in turn can assist Rama along with his millions and millions of troops.&#39; This 
is keeping the import of the verse 19 also in view.</p>

&quot;This way Vali was saying and that king of monkeys is well-informed in these aspects, isn&#39;t it! But how Ravana 
mustered up these many troops is unclear to me, and I am saying what I heard from Vali. [4-35-18]</p>

It is also unclear as to when Vali informed Tara of this military strength. For this the commentators deduce a 
situation where Vali might have told Tara. When Tara said to Vali that Angada informed her about Rama&#39;s befriending 
Sugreeva, Vali making fun of Sugreeva might have detailed Ravana&#39;s capabilities to Tara, &#39;This Sugreeva by himself 
is a useless fellow, and Ravana has got these many capabilities, then why that helpless Rama shall befriend this 
hopeless Sugreeva? Rama should have sought my help, instead!&#39; This might be the occasion for Vali to give details 
of Ravana&#39;s capabilities to Tara.</p>

Tara&#39;s reasoning is logical in calculating that a war is imminent and in the compund, <em>tat yuddhe sahāya nimittam
</em>if the word <em>tat </em>is used hen it will be: &#39;for the reason of helping that war&#39;; and if <em>tvat
</em>is used it will be: &#39;as a help to you...&#39;. In any way, &#39;the war is yours, and we are here to help...&#39; is 
the final output. Then the gist of her dialogue will be &#39;without attending to these pre-confrontation strategies 
what is the use of Sugreeva&#39;s or Hanuma&#39;s coming to you and sitting before you two, except to sing <em>bhajan-s,
