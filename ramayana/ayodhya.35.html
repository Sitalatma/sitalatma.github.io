<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div align="left">
<p class="txt">
ṃinister Sumantra requests and reproaches Queen Kaikeyi and asks her to take back her impositions. Even the elderly minister and a
scholar named Siddhartha tries to pacify Kaikeyi by telling the legend of Sagara, the ancestor of Dasharatha, quoting the exile of his notorious son
Asamanja. But she is adamant to all holy advices, but wants Rama to go to forests.</p>
