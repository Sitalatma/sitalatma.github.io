<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">At the dawn of the next day, panergysts and servants arrived at the palace to serve the king. Some women, who were empowered to go
near the bed, detected the king's death and started crying loudly. Kausalya and Sumitra suddenly woke up from their slumber and came to know of the
king's death. All the wives of Dasaratha wept miserably. The gynaecium was filled with men and women who felt bewildered with fear and restlessness;
when the king met with his appointed end.</p>
