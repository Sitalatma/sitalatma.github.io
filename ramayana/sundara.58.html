<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 58<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Jambavan, seated along with the monkey-troops, requested Hanuma to narrate clearly whatever 
has occurred. Hanuma narrates in detail how he saw ṃount ṃainaka in the course of his journey to Lanka 
and how he escaped on the way from the clutches of Surasa, a great serpent living in the ocean. Hanuma 
also narrated about his killing of Simhika, a female demon on the way and also about defeating another 
female demon (Lanka-incarnate) who was guarding the City of Lanka. Hanuma explains to Jambavan, how 
he beholds Seetha in Ashoka garden after a thorough search in the City of Lanka and how he introduces 
himself as an envoy sent by Rama and Sugreeva. Hanuma informs Jambavan that he hands over a finger-ring 
of Rama as a token of remembrance to Seetha and that he further asks for a return-token of remembrance 
from her, to be handed over to Rama. Hanuma then narrates about Seetha having delivered to him an excellent 
jewel for her head, as a token of remembrance. He further narrates about the demolition of the garden 
attached to Ravana&#39;s gynaecium and about killing of Aksha, Ravana&#39;s son. Hanuma further informs about 
his capture by Indrajit, Ravana&#39;s son and his tail being burnt by demons on receiving the orders of 
Ravana. He further informs about his setting fire of the City of Lanka. He finally narrates about his 
re-visit to Seetha and his return to ṃount ṃahendra.</p>
