<p class="comment">
So far the handsomeness of Shūrpanakha is not narrated in these verses. But Rama&#39;s addressing her as 
a handsome woman is for fun sake, so some commentators say. The episode Shūrpanakha is considered to 
have <em>hāsya rasa</em>, comic relief. Refusing the unnecessarily joking of Rama some say that Shūrpanakha 
came there with an exquisite form. And what all said negatively about her in preceding verses is the 
implicit idea of the poet. Taking the entrance of Shūrpanakha with a beautiful personality every cinema 
that is shot on Ramayana gives a cabaret dance with inciting song to Shūrpanakha at this situation.</p>

<p class="comment">
In some other mms there are a few more verses that contain a situation where Jatayu comes to Rama to 
take leave of him to go and see his relatives and bird-friends, after Rama returns from the river. Then, 
knowing that Jatayu is not there Shūrpanakha enters the cottage area with a guise of winsome beauty. 
No demon or demoness can approach that cottage of Rama, as long as Jatayu is there - is the point for 
establishment. While the difference in mms/texts is between one or two letters like, <em>na hi tāvat 
manojña angī</em> and <em>tvam hi tāvat manojña angī</em> , whether the poet entered Shūrpanakha 
in a fashionable getup or as an old female is another point that remained inconclusive.</p>
