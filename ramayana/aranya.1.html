  <h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - Forest Treck<br>chapter [Sarga] 1<br>
	Verses converted to UṭF-8, Sep, 09</h3>
    
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p class="tat">
 Rama, Seetha, and Lakshmana enter the great forest called Dandaka Forest
          and adore the eminent sages, who are in penance and hermitages in that forest. This canto
          is named as Aranya Kanda not just to show that Rama roved over just forests. The forests,
          as per Indian tradition, are the treasure houses of knowledge, and they are the ultimate
          in Vedic culture.</p>

          <p class="tat">
 Thus, until Ayodhya Kanda Rama's exile is in <font color=
          "#B3003A">āryavarta</font> , the place of noblemen, from River Ganges to Greece. Now
          Rama is stepping into an area called <font color="#B3003A">janasthana</font>,meaning
          people's place. This janasthana is the place where Rama eradicated certain negative
          aspects of the then anarchic individualised dominions where jungle law was the only
          recourse and brought all of them under one roof. Though people lived there about along
          with sages and demons as well, demonic influence is said to be predominant, as per
          Ramayana or other Purana-s. These demons are narrated to be man-eaters, but not cannibals
          who eat their own tribesmen.Recent discoveries revealed that the first humans were
          cannibals.</p>

          <p class="tat">
 The Science magazine reported about the excavations at Neanderthals
          Neander Valley, Germany. In the words of Alban Defleur of the Universite de la
          ṃediterranee at ṃasrseilles, France, "The finding allows us for the first time to
          demonstrate the existence of the practice of cannibalism by European eanderthals." It is
          not clear from the excavations of Neanderthals, whether the cannibalism was practised for
          survival or as a ritual.And even at Alveston in the western English country of
          Gloucestershire, recently found are such human thighbones, which had been split down the
          middle to remove marrow. Archaeologists of Bristol University are saying that the
          evidence indicated the victims could have been disabled and deformed people in society.
          They have been murdered and eaten, and the radiocarbon dating suggests these finds are
          about 2000 years ago. This practice is attributed to some underworld cults during the
          later Iron Age. That being the situation in Europe, in the knowable history, in Ramayana
          that has happened in an unknown era, the rakshasa-s are narrated to be man-eaters, but
          not as cannibals.But the accounts given in Aranya Kanda and elsewhere, in ancient India
          the rakshasa-s ate up humans neither for their own survival nor for ritual but to exhibit
          their tyranny and their barbaric supremacy. They never reported to have eaten their own
          clansmen, but have a palate for other breed. Hence it is not exactly cannibalism, but a
          barbaric act to exert savage scare. This is what the sages advise Rama, Seetha and
          Lakshmana when departing towards Dandaka Aranya, and indirectly suggest eradicating such
          a savage atmosphere in peaceful forests.</p>

          <p class="tat">
 When it comes to <font color="#B3003A">
 isms</font>
  , it is said that the
          whole clash is between <font color="#B3003A">Vaishnavaites</font> and <font color=
          "#B3003A">Shaivites</font> or <font color="#B3003A">Shāktaites</font> , because the
          rākshasa-s are invariably Shiva worshippers, where Vaishnavism is a later development.
          All the rākshasa-s or demons [in fact the term 'demon' do not suit them,] portrayed
          hereafter, are ardent worshippers of Shiva, and have every blessing from Shiva or Brahma.
          It is an ethnicity of its own which lived rich lives, pompous in attributes, wielded
          magical powers, and unabatedly performed anything that is beneficial for them.Their
          riches and glory will be reflected in Sundara Kanda, which will be burnt down by Hanuma,
          humbling this deleterious ethnicity, even before Rama's war with Ravana. Such an ethnic
          culture will be portrayed hereafter, in constant conflict with Rama, and Rama eradicating
          each and every member of such ethnicity that goes against any civility.</p>

          <p class="txt">
 It is said that Rama performed <font color="#B3003A">
 dīna jana
          rakshana</font> in this Aranya Kānda, ṃiserable People's Protection and <font color=
          "#B3003A">mitra jana rakshana</font> in the next canto Kishkindha Kānda, i.e., Friendly
          People's Protection. The janasthana is the unexplored area by the then people of
          āryavarta, where the rākshasa ethnicity prevailed and which certainly resisted any
          outside influences or culture, and which is why they are called rākshasa-s. The word
          <font color="#B3003A">raksha</font> means protection, and they protect their own culture
          and ethnicity, and if any outsiders to join them, they shall be subservient.For e.g.,
          Ravana does not tolerate the insult meted out by his sister Shūrpanakha at the hands of
          Lakshmana.Ravana, though persuaded by ṃāreecha not to encounter Rama, does not listen to
          any advises but wished to abduct Seetha, because he wanted to possess that beautiful
          woman, like all other beautiful, pompous objects like Kubera's wealth, Lanka, the golden
          city and Pushpaka aircraft etc. Ravana even baits Seetha with queen-hood, if only she
          subjugates to him, and all these dictatorial aspects reveal the pride and vanity of
          Rakshasa culture. But the term 'demon' used in paucity of equivalent term may not be
          taken to mean just as a wicked demon or a devil, but a powerful antagonistic culture or
          ethnic dominions of Rakshasas, in Janasthana.</p>

          <p class="tat">
 Rama does much good in jansthana in wiping out those cultures of greedily
          dictatorial, magically overpowering, and ruinous to other forms of civility. In fact this
          Aranya Kanda is not explained in vivid terms by the ancient commentators, and if things
          are probed deeper in this book, Aranya Kanda, Rama did more social work than
          miracles.Hence much can be explored into this Aranya Kānda, the Book of Forest, in terms
          of sociological, demographically and ethnological pursuits of Rama to establish one great
          orderly civil empire under one emperor, that is what we call Rama Rājya. Further, it
          will be narrated that Rama killed these Rakshasas in thousands, which is objected by
          materialists as how can an archer eliminate so many thousands of Rakshasas, with just a
          bow and arrows.It may be remembered that Sage Viswamitra accords many kinds of missiles
          to Rama, after the killing of Tataka, the demoness, in Bala Kanda.It may not be
          surprising for this generation to know that a single trigger can create havoc of
          Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and then in all its probability Rama also might have triggered in
          the same way, with the missiles endowed by Sage Viswamitra.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 The word <em>
 ātmavān</em>
  is the question Valmiki put to Narada at the start
  of the epic in Bala Kanda, as the first word of verse 1-1-4. The courage and invincibility are
  reflected in the opening verse of this canto, since Rama has to perform <em>dīna jana</em> or
  <em>sajjana rakshaṇa</em> i.e., saving the helpless or goodly men, viz. in the present context,
  the sages. The sages are to be saved from the onslaught of demons, which requires, both courage
  and un-invincibility. Apart from the above <em>ātmavān</em> normally means sagacious one.</p>

  [3-1-2]</p>

  <p class="comment">
 This connotes Vedic import in saying that Supreme is far beyond from Solar
  orbit. In <em>īshāvāsyopanishad</em> , at hymn 15, we hear the following <em>mantra</em> ,
  hymn:</p>

  <p class="smItṣ">
 Om hirṇmayeṇ pātreṇ satyasya apihitam mukham |<br>
 
  tat tvam pūṣhan apāvṛiṇu satya dharmāya dṛiṣhṭaye ||</p>

I as truthful, righteous one; d<em>ṛiṣṭaye</em>= to visualise, [that which is beyond you.]&nbsp;<br>
	</p>

  <p class="tat">
 On looking at the rising red sun, the devotee is asking "Oh! Pooshan! God Sun,
  nourisher of the universe, the trueness of the Supreme is covered by your golden disk like
  vessel, [i.e., your Solar disk,] slide it aside, for as a truthful and righteous devotee, I
  visualize [that which is beyond your golden Solar disc.]</p>

  <p class="comment">
 This is said to be the coming of Supreme into lower abode of Solar orbit from
  His Supreme abode, say <em>vaikuṇṭHa</em>. Now Rama and Seetha are passing through this dazzling
  Solar-orbit like hermitage, to present themselves before the true devotees, and even to eradicate
  vice on earth. This appearance is without any prayers from the devotee, as contained in the above
  Vedic hymn. God reveals Himself</p>

  <p class="comment">
 The Vedic ritual demands three Fireplaces called <em>
 tretāgni</em>
  , three
  fires. They are <em>dakshiṇa agni</em> Southern Fire; <em>gārhapatya agni</em> Household Fire;
  <em>āhavanīya agni</em> Invocation Fire. These three are lit day in and day out, symbolising
  that the fire in living beings has continuity. Wherever a Vedic ritual takes place the celestials
  will come to take their share of oblations and the celestial dancers dance thereabout in praise
  of the ritual. The oblation vessels are of particular nature and a long spoon is made of
  particular wood, to oblate clarified butter or milk etc., into the Alter of Fire. The deerskin is
  the prescribed seat for meditation. The sacrificial grass is the essential item of even in
  domestic rituals, symbolising that the human kind shall prosper like the interlaced and
  intermingled grass, where the starting or the end point is intractable.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 Indian archers fasten the bowstring only when that bow is to be put to use.
  Further there is a method described in <em>dhanurveda</em> as to how a bowstring is to be
  fastened to the other end of the bow. The Indian mythological bows are of six feet or two yards,
  in height. It is also a measure like horse length. The string, which so far is spiralled to the
  bow beam, is to be removed. Then the bottom end of the bow is to be kept pressed onto the ground
  with left foot's big toe. Then with the right hand the edge of the string is handled and with
  left hand the other end of the bow is to be held and crouched, so that the string can be hooked
  or fastened there. After fastening, the stretch of the string is to be tested [like the
  occasional testing of the badminton or tennis racquet for the tension of its gut,] by pulling and
  leaving it, so that it makes a warring sound. By this sound of the bowstring, which is a signal
  to the opponent, the opponent comes to know as to who is handling which bow. Then if the archer
  is going to beam out an arrow, he shall pull the arrow on the bowstring up to his right ear and
  leave it, <em>ākarṇānta prayoga</em> . Here, removing the bowstring from its fastening implies
  that this archer, namely Rama who is so far handling the stringed bow, for he is roaming in
  forests, and since he is entering the place of elderly saints now, unfastened the bowstring in
  all his humbleness to sages and saints.</p>

 This context is also explained in the following ways:</p>
 

<p class="pratipada">
<em>te</em> = they, the knowers of three-times, past, present and future; <em>tam</em> = them, [demons, to eliminate];
<em>udyantam + somam + iva + sthitam</em> = rising, moon, like, he who is there - he that Rama is here to remove darkness

<p class="pratipada">
ṭhe sages rendered Vedic Blessings on seeing the rising moon to eradicate the darkness called demons, for Rama is their 
object of worship as a virtuous one and they themselves are the followers of virtue.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
Or, the sages have physically seen that object of their worship, Rama the virtuous one, who they are so far seeing with 
their inner senses alone, and rendered Vedic Blessings.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
Or, the sages rendered the Vedic Blessings on seeing the moon-like Rama emerging to eradicate the darkness called demons. 
But this Rama is having attributes like <em>rūpa saṃhananam lakṣhmīm saukumāryam</em> as visualised by the sages, as 
at verse 13. And to not to happen any untoward incident to this delicate, dainty, graceful young man at the hands of the 
ireful demons, the sages rendered Vedic Blessings as a precautionary measure, for the sages are <em>dhṛiDha + vratāḥ</em> 
= determined in their vow, to eradicate the demons, through Rama. ṭhis is the rendering of <em>Govindaraja</em>.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>te</em> = they, the sages; <em>mangalān + prayunjānāḥ</em> = blessings, rendered; <em>udyantam + somam + iva</em> 
= emerging, moon-like - gladdening all the world like a pleasant moon; tam= him, that Rama; pratyagṛihṇan= received as 
their presiding deity of virtue. ṭhis is the rendering of <em>ṃaheshvara ṭīrtha</em>.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>te</em> = those sages; <em>udyantam + somam + iva</em> = arising, moon-like - arising like the presiding deity of Brahmins. 
It is said in Veda-s <em>tasmāt soma rājāno brāhmaṇāḥ</em> ṃoon shall be the deity of Brahmins - Vedic ṣcholars, for 
Veda is dharma, the virtue and the Vedic Brahmins are the preachers and practisers of that virtuosity. <em>yashashvinīm</em> 
= glorious ṣeetha, for she is the principal cause in eradicating demons; thus, by finding such protectors who have come 
hither to ameliorate the difficulties of sage, the sages rendered Vedic Blessings. ṭhis is <em>tilaka</em> or also known 
as <em>Rama ṭilaka</em></p>

 Here <em>

  richly decorated. <em>samhanana</em> is beauty of the well arranged body parts with no
  dissimilarities, where the good old saying 'equality is the basis of beauty, and inequality is
  the basis of society...' may be remembered. <em>lakshmīḥ</em> is <em>lāvaṇya</em> i.e.,
  self-luminous augustness. While <em>saukumārya</em> is the delicacy, like that of a blooming
  flower. <em>suveṣa</em> is a neat and tidy outfit or suitable outfit. Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana
  wear a particular dress, given by Queen Kaikeyi in Ayodhya. Those dresses are peculiar to
  themselves and not on par with the regular dress of hermits. This dress of these three itself is
  a confusing attire for onlookers, like demon Viradha, or monkey-chief Sugreeva, for these three
  do look like neither perfect sages nor perfect warriors. Even the demon Viradha scorns them in
  the next chapter, for the inconstancy in their attire and their wielding weapons.</p>

 Here, Rama may be astonished as to why these forest dwelling sages eulogise
  him so much. The sages are not using unnecessary conversation and they are informing Rama what a
  king shall be, whether he is in the capital or in forests. The term Indra is an allusion to the
  'Ruler'. It refers to seven more rulers or ruler like associates of Indra, <em>ashta
  dikpālaka</em>-s. It is said that:</p>

  <p class="Itrṣloka">
 aṣhṭābhir loka pālānām mātrābhiḥ nirmito nṛipaḥ</p>
 

  <p class="comment">
 A king is made with eight aspects of eight rulers of eight corners of the
  universe. Viz., <em>indra, vāyu</em> [Air,] <em>yama</em> Death-god <em>sūrya</em> Sun,
  <em>agni</em> Fire, <em>varuṇa</em> Rain <em>chandra</em> ṃoon, and <em>kubera</em> Wealth. When
  the earth is heading towards anarchy, Brahma is said to have created the king with one fourth of
  resplendence of each of the eight rulers. ṃanu Srmriti states as below:</p>

  <p class="Itrṣloka">
 indra anila yama arkam agneshca varuṇasya ca |<br>
 
  candra vittesha yoḥ caiva mtr nirhṛitya shāshvateeḥ ||</p>

  <p class="comment">
 ṃanu smriti also prescribes certain rules for the king called Vrata. Indra
  accords rains for four months to sprout the seeds, so the king shall sprout the people's hopes.
  Sun evaporates earthly water slowly and insignificantly so as to give the next rain, so the king
  shall collect taxes and spend them again for the welfare of people <em>sūrya vrata</em> . Air
  pervades everywhere to enliven people, so the king shall pervade everywhere through his agents to
  watch out good and evil for his subjects <em>māruta vrata</em> . Yama, the God of Time, has no
  friends or foes and ends the lives of any one at the end of their time, and so shall the king in
  according punishments <em>yama vrata</em> . Rain binds one and all and it is the livelihood of
  any living being, so is king to bind his subjects for a good livelihood <em>varuṇa vrata</em> .
  ṃoon is both a pleasant one and presiding deity for medicinal herbs, so shall the king be
  pleasant to his people and keep their health <em>chandra vrata</em> . Fire is fiery and burns
  down evil and the king shall be fiery to his enemies, either internal or external <em>āgneya
  vrata</em> . The earthly earth sustains scholars and stupid, wealthy and poor, prosperous and
  pathetic alike, so shall the king bear with all of his subjects <em>pṛithvī vrata</em></p>
