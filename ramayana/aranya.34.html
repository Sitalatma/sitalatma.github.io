<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 34<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Ravana enquires about Rama&#39;s valour and weaponry for which Shūrpanakha narrates about Rama, Seetha, 
and Lakshmana and what has happened in Janasthāna. Thus she prompts Ravana to achieve Seetha as his 
wife, for none surpasses Seetha in her beauty.</p>

On observing Shūrpanakha who is speaking bitter words against him in the presence of ministers then

<p class="tat">
&quot;Who is Rama? How brave he is? Of what mien and what calibre he is? And for what reason he entered the 
highly inscrutable Dandaka forest? [1-34-2]</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Why this Rama has to come this far to Dandaka instead of loitering somewhere near Himalayas? Has he 
come purposefully with any revenge against us, the demons, or is it a pleasure-trip? Why should he leave 
his ancestral kingdom and enter Dandaka, a stronghold of demons?&#39; This is the real worry of Ravana.
<em>kena ca kāraṇena kula parampara āgatam prājyam rājyam parityajya nikhila nishācara vāso asmin 
deshe samāgataḥ - dk</em> Ravana might be unaware that Dandaka forest also belongs to Ikshvaku-s as 
Kishkindha belonged to them, as said by Rama at the time of eliminating of Vali.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;What is the weapon of that Rama by whom these many demons are killed in war, likewise Dūshana and 
Trishira are killed, and even the unkillable Khara is killed? Oh, lady with fascinating limbs, who disfigured 
you? That you tell. [1-34-3, 4a]</p>

<p class="comment">
This can be simple question &#39;What is his weapon?&#39; without telling round about as above. But Ravana is 
weighing arsenal balance since he is self-content with a giant-robot namely Kumbhakarna, and with a 
brave and all-trickster son Indrajit, along with his own ICBṃs, Aṣṃs and Aṣṃs, plus his own invincibility. 
Thereby he is said to be puzzled at arsenal-less Rama and asking:
<em>kāni kāni 
ca āyudhāni khara mukha nishācra prāṇa hāni karāṇi - dk</em>&#39;you said that Rama caused this havoc 
single-handedly, then he should have used various and numerous weapons by which missiles are flung... 
because common sense does not permit any belief that a handheld bow can dart numerous arrows or missile, 
that too when wielded by a single human...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Here she twisted the story line to her side, as she edited the scene of her humiliation later to annihilation 
of their army. In Dandaka witch-hunting is over and it is calm and collected now. In fact, Ravana intruded 
into Janasthāna of Dandaka and stationed some army to protect intrusion into Lanka, as his mainstay 
is only the castled city Lanka. Now that the doors to Lanka are wide open Lanka is exposed to an imminent 
danger. <font face="Translit 98" size="3em" color="#B3003A">
