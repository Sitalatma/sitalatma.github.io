<h3><em>Planting the Seed of Bhakti</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp141" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
By the extraordinary mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the conditioned souls get the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em>. <em>Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</em>. We cannot imagine how fortunate such souls are nowadays when we are distributing so many books. We are giving them the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> after they have been wandering throughout the material world for millions of lifetimes. They may not know it, and we may not even realize it, but whoever agrees to take a book about Kṛṣṇa begins the process of <em>bhakti-yoga</em>. The seed is planted, but we don't even think about it when we distribute books, because it is too amazing—it is the most wonderful thing. The book distributors are the most magnanimous souls because they plant the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> in the hearts of all sorts of people who otherwise never would have a chance of going back to Godhead. Totally unfortunate souls become totally fortunate by the mercy of the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp142" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
We are like farmers planting seeds, and some of these seeds will grow within our lifetime. But sometimes <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees become fruitive and ask, “We've been distributing so many books. Why isn't the temple filled with devotees?” The answer is, “Because that is not the way it works.” You have given a book about Kṛṣṇa to a completely conditioned soul who has been wrapped up in ignorance since time immemorial, and he has given you a donation. His spiritual life has started, but he may not complete it in this lifetime.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp143" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When you become a devotee and move into the temple, practically speaking, you are close to going back to Godhead. You have conquered over material nature to such a degree that you understand the only hope is to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and you dedicate your life to surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. This means you are close to surrendering fully; you are in the last stage.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp144" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In the beginning people should understand they are committing sinful activities. That is the first stage. They should at least understand that they are doing something wrong, but they don't even understand that. They think that slaughtering and eating animals and getting drunk is fine. They are steeped in ignorance. They don't know what is right and what is wrong.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp145" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
But once people get in touch with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their spiritual lives will gradually begin. They will start to understand that they have to make a change. They will understand that the material world is not a nice place to live. Maybe they will visit Kṛṣṇa's temple. But guaranteed in the next life or in some lifetime, they will again do something Kṛṣṇa conscious and gradually advance further. Even if it takes one hundred lifetimes, this is nothing compared to the millions and millions of lifetimes they have undergone searching for Kṛṣṇa. They don't know they are searching for Kṛṣṇa, but that is what they are doing. Therefore <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is glorious because it igradually attaches all these people to the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Maybe they will take it now, maybe they will not. We cannot say. But we can say that they will become devotees some time, whereas before we met them and gave them a book they had no chance.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp146" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Book distribution is a long-range program to bring all conditioned souls back to Godhead. It also has short-term goals, namely, to distribute more books so that we can produce more books in other languages as well. The more book distribution goes on, the more people will understand about Kṛṣṇa. If only one percent of the people we give books to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, that is a lot of people. Planting the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> is important work, because it gives people a chance to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp147" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
So much can be said about planting the <em>bhakti-latā-bija</em>, but you should meditate on it yourself when you are on the street. We should plant more and more seeds without stopping. Everything becomes lifeless when book distribution stops. But when book distribution is going on, everything is full of life, vigor, energy, and happiness. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge; it is an ocean of transcendental bliss —<em>ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam</em>; and it increases that ocean and gives us the taste for which we are always anxious.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp148" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
We should be determined to continue this process because it is the best possible means to please Kṛṣṇa. There are so many living entities that Kṛṣṇa is not very happy with, but Kṛṣṇa becomes happy with you—the individual distributor—when you go on distributing this literature. Therefore we should never forget what we are doing, not even for a moment. We should always remember that the goal of this mission is to give every conditioned soul on this planet a chance to buy Srīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books. If we can do this, we will be blessed by Kṛṣṇa's pure mercy and go right back home, back to Godhead.

<h3><em>The Literary Incarnation</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp150" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Love of Kṛṣṇa, the highest love that one can possibly have, is directly manifesting in Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books. When the living entity gets one of these books, the perfection of his life is fulfilled because he gets Kṛṣṇa in his hands. Of the many incarnations and forms of the Lord, the most important one in this Age of Kali is the literary incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <em>Śrīmad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp151" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In past ages, there were no books—there was only transcendental sound vibration. These sound vibrations are still vibrating—they are eternal, and they do not deteriorate—but because a gross body doesn't understand the eternal <em>Veda</em>, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda has captured the transcendental sound vibration in his books. His books contain the same eternal message that Kṛṣṇa explained to Arjuna, that Śukadeva Gosvāmī explained to Mahārāja Parīksit, and that the other <em>mahājanas</em> have explained to the devotees of the Lord since time immemorial. When these deep concepts from Kṛṣṇa go into the hearts of the living entities, the living entities become absorbed little by little in love of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp152" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The <em>Bhāgavata-māhātmya</em> explains that one who gives away<em> Śrīmad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> on a full moon night gets liberation. Thus we will attain liberation by performing this sarkīrtana activity, for we are giving out so many <em>Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tams</em> (not only on full moon nights but in other phases of the moon as well). No activity is greater. It directly connects us with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<h3><em>Putting Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda in the Center</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp154" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Our Kṛṣṇa conscious connection with Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda is through his books. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda said, “I am living forever in these books.” So how can you not have a connection to the author if you read these books and distribute these books? You have him in your hands all day, every day.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp155" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
One person accused us of not worshiping Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda very nicely in this zone. He said, “Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda is not in the center.” I rarely get angry, but when I heard that, I became very angry and said, “What does it mean to put Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda in the center?" In every temple Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda is on the <em>vyāsāsana</em>, and we offer him <em>guru-pūjā</em>, flowers, and prayers. What does it mean to be in the center? That you offer a bigger garland? More flowers? Does it matter if you offer a bigger garland? Does that mean that you are a better devotee or that you have more love for Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda? Maybe he didn't like wearing big garlands. What does it mean? To put Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda in the center means you produce and distribute his books in every language of the world. If that is your main service, how can  Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda not be the center of all your activities?
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp156" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
However, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda said that his books are not just for distributiion—they are for reading. Therefore you should read these books. If you read Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books and expertly learn the philosophy within them, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda will always be in the center of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

<h3><em>How to Please the Spiritual Master</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp158" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda once explained, “The business of the spiritual master is to serve and please his spiritual master, and the business of the disciple is to assist his spiritual master in doing this.” If you want to please your spiritual master, you have to understand your position as a disciple. The disciple is simply meant for serving the spiritual master. What is that service? It is to become a perfect assistant in fulfilling the mission of the spiritual master's spiritual master.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp159" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The guru is only one person—what can he do alone? Although Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda did everything alone, we personally are useless alone because we are not Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda; we are just insignificant particles of dust, trying to offer Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda something for his pleasure. Thus we are fully dependent on the mercy of our disciples.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp160" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Of course, the disciple is fully dependent on the mercy of the spiritual master. Without the mercy of the spiritual master, no one can make any advancement. If you don't spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by distributing books, I cannot please Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, and he will say, “What's wrong with you? You're not doing anything!” I will be as useless as you, and I will have to yell at you, "What's wrong with you? Why aren't you doing anything?" I will have no connection to Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda and his mercy. If I cannot get Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's mercy, I cannot give you his mercy. Thus we will all remain in the material soup, wondering what is going on.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp161" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Therefore, if you want the mercy, you have to accept the mercy. The mercy is to serve the spiritual master by serving his mission and distributing as much Kṛṣṇa conscious literature as you possibly can. As soon as you accept that mission and endeavor to accomplish it, the mercy will immediately come. You cannot sit in a corner and wait for someone to plug you into the wall so that you can get juiced up with energy. Rather, as you utilize your own insignificant power, more energy comes.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp162" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
All activities begin with desire. If you desire to engage in material activities, material nature helps you according to your karma. If you desire and endeavor spiritually, spiritual energy helps you according to your surrender and how much you please your spiritual master. And you please your spiritual master by endeavoring to serve the mission of his spiritual master. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's mission is clear. It is for all of us. We have to take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement seriously, and we have to take the distribution of Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books very seriously.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp163" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">

<h3><em>Books Are the Basis</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp164" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
“Books are the basis” is not an idle phrase. If book distribution is not going on because some people have the idea in their heads that something is wrong with it, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will suffer and collapse. This movement will be strong again, like it was when Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was still here, when we understand that we are not proper disciples unless we distribute books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp165" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Whatever preaching we do verbally is praiseworthy, but without book distribution talking is a waste of time. For example, we wrote a book about <em>varņāśrama-dharma</em> only because Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books were being distributed. If books are not distributed, <em>varņāśrama-dharma</em> is mythology and to talk about it or anything else is worthless, because our connection with Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda and the potency of our preaching comes from book distribution.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp166" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
To consider yourself a disciple of mine, you also have to consider yourself a disciple of Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda is the grandfather <em>guru</em>. Now, when the grandfather is so much more qualified than and superior to the father, the child looks up to the grandfather and takes inspiration from him just as the father does.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp167" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Naturally father and son have affection for each other, but in spiritual relationships the father has more affection for the grandfather. I have more affection for Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda than I have for anyone else. All my feelings for the whole mass of my disciples don't compare to my feelings for Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda. Every disciple should feel that way about his spiritual master.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp168" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
<hr class="rule">
<h3><em>Close Down the Temple</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp169" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Nothing is more important than book distribution; nothing comes even close. All cooking, cleaning, preaching, or managing is subordinate. If we go to sleep in the <em>māyā</em> of thinking that book distribution is inferior, we should lock the temple and go out and distribute books. The only thing that counts is this Kṛsṇa conscious book distribution.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp170" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In 1974 Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda sent everybody out to distribute books. In a famous letter, he told Śrī Govinda in Chicago to shut down the temple and leave one man to do the <em>pūjā</em> and manage. That year Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda told everyone to go out on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> until we finally got it into our thick skulls that he wanted us to distribute his books. Only then did he tell some to stay back and do the <em>pūjā</em> and other things.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp171" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Thus we began to understand there must be a balance. At first we just chanted day and night on the street. Then we made temples and devotees. Then Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda sent everyone back on the street to distribute books. And now we have a whole range of Kṛṣṇa conscious activities that we think are so important. But what did Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda do every time we got such foolish ideas in our heads? He would say, “Stop everything you're doing, it's all nonsense! Go out on the street and preach!” He did this because we want to shut down our energy and take it easy in a comfortable living arrangement. But no one is happy in such living arrangements. We gradually sink into the mud and only get more distressed, because comfort in the material world means <em>māyā</em>, and as soon as you are in <em>māyā</em> you are miserable.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp172" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Therefore we have to get out of <em>māyā</em>, and the way to get out of <em>māyā</em> is to go out the door and distribute books! If you try all day and night as hard as you can and you only manage to do ten books, that is better than sitting around, thinking, “Oh, my ten books don't mean anything anyway.” This negative mentality anchors the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to the ground. But if everyone thinks, “I have to do it, I have to try, I have to struggle,” the whole movement takes off and flies, because this movement is worth nothing more than the members who make it up.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp173" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
<hr class="rule">
<h3><em>Don't Get Out of Balance</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp174" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
We all have the responsibility to become perfect followers of our spiritual masters. Many have talked as if they were following properly, but in fact they were never following Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's instructions. One may say whatever one likes, but if one cannot follow the regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds a day, what is the use of such talk? Talk is cheap. Anyone can claim to be a disciple, but one must act like a disciple by having discipline. Disciple means discipline—it means we discipline our lives according to the instructions of the spiritual master.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp175" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda has given us plenty of instructions, and we should follow all of them. He said that books are the basis, but he also said that purity is the force and utility is the principle. We cannot say that books are the basis and accept impurity, because purity is the force that maintains and expands the basis. We cannot say that utility is the principle and reject books as impractical and sell paraphernalia instead. We cannot talk about purity and not understand that without books there is no basis to purity. Without distributing Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books we are not connected to Caitanya Mahāprabhu's plan to expand His <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. Utility and purity are useless without the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. Thus there must be a balance between purity, utility, and the basis.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp176" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Therefore we accept all three. Continue to distribute books and push on this mission. Maintain the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Chant your rounds and hear them. All these principles must be practiced. Don't get out of balance! You can only maintain your activities within a structured Kṛṣṇa conscious society when you are properly balanced.

<h3><em>The <em>Vedānta</em> of ISKCON</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp178" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The only thing you must do in this life is know Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's transcendental books and induce others to know them. Therefore we distribute books. Some may think that book distribution is a passionate activity that should not be talked about, but book distribution is the <em>Vedānta</em> of ISKCON.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp179" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
You can only appreciate this activity of producing and distributing books when you understand the conclusion of the <em>Vedas</em>. The conclusion of the <em>Vedas</em> is to be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa, but one cannot be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa if one does not know Him. Knowing Kṛṣṇa can take many lifetimes, <em>bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate</em>. But when a person knows Kṛṣṇa, he will see Him everywhere, <em>vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti</em>. Such a person becomes like Prahlāda Mahārāja, unconcerned with bodily pleasures and pains. He is only interested in producing and distributing the Vedic literature in all the languages of the world, because he wants others to come to the same platform he has attained. This is an elite position, <em>sa mahātmā su-durlabhā</em>, the topmost platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp180" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Occasionally when I lecture on such points, some devotees become disturbed. For instance, they think that because I am such a <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> fanatic I am against <em>gu&shy;&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>. That is foolish because I am also a <em>gu&shy;&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> fanatic. But what are we training the <em>gu&shy;&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> students for? To become first-class Vedāntists and first-class book producers and distributors, so they can break the teeth of the Māyāvādīs.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp181" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Everyone in ISKCON is trained to become a Vedāntist who can give <em>Vedānta</em> to others. For example, when a devotee who works with machines buys a machine part, he gives <em>Vedānta</em> to the man who supplies the parts by giving him a book. Also the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are experts at giving <em>Vedānta</em>; when they buy gas for the car, they pay with a book. Therefore, although a Vaiṣṇava devotee may go out to accomplish a <em>śūdra</em> activity, he goes out with <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> spirit, and everyone he meets advances toward the path of <em>Vedānta</em>.

<h3><em>Crystallization</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp183" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Book distribution has unimaginable potency. Because of this book production and distribution, one of the biggest problems in the world is becoming crystallized.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp184" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Even if one is not able to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can understand that a separation is taking place between those with a demoniac nature and those with a leaning toward the divine, and the gap is widening. More people are gradually waking up and looking toward the mode of goodness - even in countries where they were oppressed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp185" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Each book that goes out is another weight on the back of the demons, and they don't like it. Demons cannot tolerate glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They don't mind Bibles because nobody takes the Bible seriously, but our books really bother them because they see that our books have potency. “Where are those books?” they say. “Let us burn these horrible books that are ruining everything!” They confiscate the books, but the person in charge of destroying them steals a few and distributes them. The public censor, who reads the books to make sure they don't contain something that will pollute the minds of the people, likes the books and gives them to his children. The books are going everywhere, and the demons cannot stop it.

People addicted to the materialistic way of life cannot become Kṛṣṇa conscious. <em>Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram</em>: they are progressing toward the hellish regions. Such people may be friendly with you as long as it gratifies their senses, but they change as soon as you bring out a Kṛṣṇa conscious book. They take one look at it and scream and flee down the street like ghosts confronted with the cross of a priest. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, Arjuna says, “Your holy name is so potent that, upon Your appearance, the demons become afraid and flee here and there.” Sometimes devotees lament when these demons become angry, but that is the glorious proof of the potency of our books.

<h3><em>"You Are Brainwashed!”</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp188" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Somebody may say that I am brainwashing you. But if you don't like to be brainwashed in this way, the door is over there. We have come together to be brainwashed. The brain is dirty. It has been filled with material contamination for many lifetimes. We take out bleach, ammonia, heavy detergents, and brushes, and we clean the brain. Then, after a lot of work, some rascal comes up and says, “You're brainwashed!” To that we should immediately reply, “You're a stool brain! If my brain is clean and you don't like it, that means you like filth and are in the mode of ignorance.” What is cleaner than a clean brain absorbed in the book distribution mission? Nothing! Therefore we don't mind being brainwashed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp189" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Only those who are brainwashed can brainwash others. For example, if you ask a completely filthy person who has been outside in the dirt, mud, and grease to clean your room, he can attempt to clean it, but he will just leave streaks of filth everywhere. How can someone dirty clean anything? Those who scream, “You are brainwashed,” are just jealous because they cannot brainwash anybody. Still these envious rascals try to brainwash you by saying something like, “Those who sell books out on the street all day are zombies." But they are only throwing stool on the brain, and the first thing that happens when you listen to them is that books don't get produced or distributed.

<h3><em>The Words of a Pure Devotee Are Always True</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp191" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, has said that simply by distributing these books we can change the world. His words will not prove false. Kṛṣṇa has proven time and time again that the words of a pure devotee are always true. Kṛṣṇa Himself always makes them true. So how can these words be untrue?
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp192" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda has said that these books will spark off a revolution in the impious hearts of a dull humanity. Revolution is a big word. It means an uprising against <em>māyā</em>. People will finally say that they don't want this garbage material existence anymore and that they want spiritual life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp193" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda once wrote in a letter to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, “Kṛṣṇa can give you the whole country in eighteen days if He wants, but you have to be qualified to accept it.” When we are all qualified Kṛṣṇa will give. He doesn't even need eighteen days; He can do it in eighteen minutes if He wants. It depends on whose desire is stronger, ours or the demons'. If the demons' desire to enjoy is stronger, they will keep these places; and if we can distribute books and change people's desires, Kṛṣṇa will help us more.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp194" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
One must have faith in Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's words. So many rascals pretending to be devotees have made big words yet have no faith in Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's mission. They neither produce books nor distribute them. They say that they are great, and if you look for results, they have no results. But if you look for results from those who have faith in Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's words, they are producing and distributing Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp195" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Although there are many services besides book distribution, these services are usually done by persons who cannot distribute books. Our organisational principle is that everyone who can goes out to do battle and whoever is left over does everything else. Then those left in the temple lament because they also want to participate in this wonderful mission that brings the topmost perfection of life.

<h3><em>The Purpose of the Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Movement</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp197" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not to grow food or produce children. It is not to make offices and telephone calls. It is not to fix cars or cut the grass. It is not to program computers, put wires on walls, or build machines. The purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to use these things to make and distribute books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp198" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Some may think that "advanced” is when you become a householder, do some moneymaking business, and worship the Deity; but no, that is <em>vaiśya</em> class, and we want to train up <em>brāhmaṇas</em>. A <em>brāhmaṇa</em> knows Brahman, <em>brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇah</em>, and he teaches and gives Brahman to others. Brahman is Parabrahman, Kṛṣṇa, and this <em>Śrīmad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> is Kṛṣṇa. <em>Kṛṣṇe sva-dhāmopagate dharma</em>. We are distributing Kṛṣṇa in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, Śrīmad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam, and <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp199" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Don't think that only <em>bhaktas</em> should do book distribution. Besides, if after so many years you are not a <em>bhakta</em>, then what are you? You are in <em>māyā</em>. Everybody is a <em>bhakta</em> all the time. <em>Bhakta</em> means devotee of Kṛṣṇa; a devotee of Kṛṣṇa is always interested in distributing these books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp200" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Sometimes people say, “If you only produce and distribute books, then Kṛṣṇa consciousness doesn't expand.” But we have seen that even if you don't do anything else but distribute books, the movement expands automatically. And if you distribute books and do something else, the movement also expands. But if you do something else and don't distribute books, it doesn't expand at all. Therefore the purpose of everything we do is to expand the book distribution.

<h3><em><em>Saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> Is the <em>Yuga-dharm</em>a</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp202" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In Kali-yuga, when three quarters of irreligiosity has been introduced and the remaining one quarter of religiosity (truthfulness) is quickly being diminished, the only prescribed method of sacrifice is the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. Through this <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission mankind will be able to obtain grains, the proper food for human society. Nowadays so many places on this planet do not have enough food because people are not engaged in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp203" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Only by the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em> can one get free from the disturbances of life. It is the primary benediction for humanity. Hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa, remembering Kṛṣṇa, and distributing His transcendental literature transforms one's life. We have seen that whenever somebody is having difficulties, if he goes out and distributes books, especially during a marathon, his whole life immediately transforms into a blissful <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em>. One cannot speak enough about the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em>. It is so refreshing and relaxing, and it frees one from intense problems.

<h3><em>The Service Is the Reward</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp205" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
This book distribution mission is a lifelong mission. It is not something that you only do during the marathon so that you can read your name in the newsletter and think, “Look at me! Eighty million points." You should not expect everybody to scream your name from the rooftops, nor should you expect a prize. This is a mission, and you simply participate in the mission.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp206" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When Kṛṣṇa returned to the <em>rāsa-lilā</em>, He told the <em>gopīs</em>, “My dear <em>gopīs</em>, I am not able to repay My debt for your spotless service. Therefore, kindly let your service itself be your reward.” For a devotee the service alone is payment; a devotee does not do business. Had Kṛṣṇa told the <em>gopīs</em>, "My dear <em>gopīs</em>, you are serving Me spotlessly; therefore you can all have golden bangles," that would be like being a prostitute: "You give Me pleasure, and I give you golden bangles.” Had Kṛṣṇa even made such a proposal, the <em>gopīs</em> would have been deeply insulted. But they were thankful, because their service alone was the reward.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp207" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The fact that you, out of millions of people, are engaged in the topmost ecstatic service in existence proves that you are greatly blessed. To take some other reward would be business. We do not accept salaries. A salary would be an insult to pure devotion. We engage in the service to satisfy the Supreme Lord, and that itself is the reward.

<h3><em><em>Paramātmā</em> Is Also a <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> Devotee</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp209" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
<em>Paramātmā</em> is within the heart of the conditioned souls, waiting for them to turn to Him. If even in the slightest way He sees some sincerity in a person's heart, He responds by telling him, "All right now, go there, do this. See, there is a devotee. Go to him. Ask him something." All of a sudden the conditioned soul has some deep inspiration in his heart to want a book, and he is drawn like a magnet to it. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out money that he would ordinarily waste on sense gratification. He gives it to the devotee. He would normally never give money to someone he doesn't even know. Why should he trust or buy anything from someone he meets on the street? Because the Supersoul within the heart has mercifully ordered him to. He sees the neatly wrapped book and thinks, "At least it's a new book," and he takes it.

<h3><em><em>Saṅkīrtana</em> Pleases <em>Śrīmati Rādhārāṇī</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp211" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
By distributing books, we are working to help bring the conditioned souls in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the same service Śrīmati Rādhārāṇī engages in with Her devotees. She is always getting great bliss from making arrangements for the other <em>gopīs</em> to meet Kṛṣṇa and become blissfully engaged in His personal service. It brings Her even more pleasure than directly serving does. This <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> activity is therefore glorious—by connecting people with Kṛṣṇa we are performing the activity most pleasing to Śrīmati Rādhārāņi.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp212" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Of course, the whole Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is s<em>aṅkīrtana</em> activity. Chanting the holy names of the Lord and preaching His glories in schools and universities are part and parcel of <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> activity. Therefore we should go on increasing <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> by increasing book distribution, preaching, <em>prasādam</em> distribution, and distribution of the holy name of the Lord. These activities are all extremely pleasing to Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, the previous <em>ācāryas</em>, and, ultimately, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇi.

<h3><em>Street <em>Samādhi</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp214" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
<em>Samādhi</em> means to be fully absorbed in one's worshipful object. For a devotee, <em>samādhi</em> means being fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa. The more he can do this, the more he falls into the category of being in <em>samādhi</em>. <em>Samādhi</em> is not something impossible to attain if one is always absorbed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. A book distributor can enter into this stage of <em>samādhi</em> even on the street. He enters <em>samādhi</em> when he is fully absorbed in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. When it becomes his only thought and meditation, he enters <em>samādhi</em> because of his sincere dedication.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp215" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
But there is no way to stay on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> unless you become purified, and there is no way to become fully purified unless you do <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is the means and <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is also the end. It is the means by which you can best serve and glorify Kṛṣṇa, and it is the way in which you can become glorified and glorious as Kṛṣṇa's servant. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is an amazing service—you become purified by just continuing. I can guarantee that any person who does <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> for ten years has the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa fixed within his heart. I can also guarantee that if you engage in the Kṛṣṇa conscious <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement for this one lifetime, you will go back to Godhead. Stamped and guaranteed!
