<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> You just have to meditate on it. Sometimes people think that mystic <em>yoga</em> is full of meditation and Kṛṣṇa consciousness is devoid of meditation, but that is not true. We do a lot of meditation. The difference is what we meditate on. We meditate on the spiritual master. For example, we meditate on how Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda wrote these books with great difficulty and published the first books with great austerity, how he built up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement based on these books, how he encouraged everyone to distribute books, and how he said that our entire di&shy;sci&shy;plic succession is happy when we distribute these books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp563" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The spiritual masters in ISKCON are all followers of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda, and they all have an intense desire to please Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda by distributing as many books as possible. Therefore by distributing books, we meditate on pleasing our spiritual master: "Through the mercy of my spiritual master, I can attain the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. When I please my spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa is pleased. When Kṛṣṇa is pleased, I become recognized by Him. When I become recognized by Kṛṣṇa, that's the perfection of life and there is nothing more to attain.” We should meditate just as any yogi in yogic practice would, fixing our minds on pleasing the spiritual master with one-pointed concentration.

The temple can be upside down, but we still concentrate on our services. Temple activities are diverse; there is cooking, cleaning, Deity worship, and distribution programs. <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees know that hanging around the temple may divert their meditation from their service, so they like to travel in vans. In the van, sitting on a pile of books, there is nothing else but book distribution to meditate on.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is the factor that can elevate the prā&shy;kṛ&shy;ta-bhak&shy;ta to the higher stages of devotional service?
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp566" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> <em>Prā&shy;kṛ&shy;ta-bhak&shy;tas</em> can be elevated immediately by taking up the preaching mission. I prefer not to initiate anyone who has not done <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, preaching, or production of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's books. I personally feel that if you haven't done these things, you cannot feel mercy toward other living beings. You grow up crooked and twisted, thinking that life is meant for getting nice food to eat and a nice place to live.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp567" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You can develop the proper, higher consciousness by being put into circumstances that force you to act in such a way that understanding gradually comes. You must act in higher consciousness to develop it. You may repeatedly hear how you should act, but if you refuse to act accordingly, the desire to preach will never develop, and the desire to preach distinguishes the devotees on the higher stages of devotional service from the <em>prā&shy;kṛ&shy;ta-bhak&shy;tas</em>. When a new devotee constantly hears that one should preach and distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the desire awakens within him and slowly develops into a burning desire. This desire develops by hearing, seeing the example of others, and acting accordingly. Finally he will say, “I'm sick of sitting around in the temple all day in this <em>bhak&shy;ta</em> program. Let me out of here!"

<strong>Devotee: </strong>What is the basis of compassion?
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp570" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> When you know who you are, who Kṛṣṇa is, and who the other living entities are, you will see them as members of Kṛṣṇa's spiritual family. With such transcendental knowledge, you don't just see materialists running here and there; you see fallen conditioned souls, unable to understand themselves or Kṛṣṇa because they are struggling hard with the six senses, which include the mind. Therefore, you compassionately say to them, “Stop running around and take a look at what I have for you. Read this book, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take some <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, and be happy!”.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp571" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Knowledge of Kṛṣṇa will make you compassionate. This knowledge is the key that will open the door to transcendental liberation, and you can get the key from a saintly devotee of the Lord. If you want to be compassionate, you must associate with someone who is already compassionate. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was so compassionate that in his old age, when anyone else would retire, he came to America, determined to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls. Because Pra&shy;bhupāda was so compassionate, we can become compassionate by associating with him. Compassion is learned from one who has learned to be compassionate from one who has learned to be compassionate. Our di&shy;sci&shy;plic succession is filled with compassion.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes devotees are afraid to go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Even experienced <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are sometimes afraid to go out. Where does this fear come from?

<div id="pp574" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> Fear comes from <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em> sees that you are going to go out with Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's books and destroy her influence. Therefore she subtly attacks you and creates fear to stop you.

<p>
<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami</strong>: You may think that you will avoid problems by staying in the temple, but Kṛṣṇa arranges for problems to arise in the temple, so that you will realize that it is better to go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. You will realize that although there are problems on the street, by distributing Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's books, the greatest welfare activity for all the people of this world, you are getting purified faster.

<p>
<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> If someone says that he doesn't like <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> because he has only bad experiences, then <em>māyā</em> has already succeeded in capturing him. You should preach to him, saying, “No matter what you do in this world, you will have bad experiences because of your karma. Bad experiences on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> are also because of your karma and not because of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> will bring you blissful experiences. Sometimes it seems bad, but when you see 'good' and 'bad' in your service, whatever your service may be, you are still on the material platform. You have to transcend the material platform and come to the spiritual platform, because on the spiritual platform, one sees the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, in whatever form, as wonderful."

<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> It is difficult because people are degrading. Most people are <em>śūd&shy;ras</em> who think that anyone can distribute books. However, it has been proven throughout the years that only the highest class of men can distribute books. Although <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees may not be the most technically advanced or the greatest scholars, they know much more philosophy, and temple devotees may get involved in a scandal, but book distributors are rarely touched by scandals because they are always preaching.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda didn't say that everything is <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. He is not a Mā&shy;yā&shy;vā&shy;di. He made a distinction between two forms of service: <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> support. For example, those who feed the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are supporting, and although they are a part of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, they are not doing the same service as the front line preachers. Although everyone is appreciated, we make distinctions: the front-line warriors risking their lives in battle get medals, and behind-the-line supporters get a pat on the back.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> They distribute more because they are better agents. When you understand the basis, the question is easy to answer. But if you speculate that Kṛṣṇa is distributing the books, then it doesn't make sense. How could Kṛṣṇa distribute sometimes more and sometimes fewer books? He would always do the same amount. But that is absurd. Some people are simply better agents than others, and those who are better agents distribute more books.

<div id="pp594" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<p class="conv">
<strong>Devotee:</strong> One book distributor might do two hundred books a week and another five hundred. If both are giving everything to Kṛṣṇa, they are giving equally, but their capacities are different. What does "capacity” consist of? Is it material or spiritual? We know that Kṛṣṇa gives according to our desires. How does this apply to our specific capacities to preach? 
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp595" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<p class="conv">
<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> Our capacity to work for Kṛṣṇa depends on both spiritual and material qualities. Someone materially qualified has a greater capacity to work. Yet someone else who is not materially qualified but more spiritually qualified may be able to do more than the materially adept but spiritually bankrupt person.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp596" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Take cooking, for example. A spiritually advanced person who has no interest in eating should not be able to cook a good tasting preparation based on material calculations, the material qualification being the desire to eat, because he has no relationship with the end product. As Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda put it, “He who likes to eat can cook.” Thus both material and spiritual qualifications work together simultaneously to mold the devotee. In other words, capacity means a composite of spiritual and material qualifications. A book distributor materially qualified to communicate with people would have a better chance of distributing books well than one who is aloof.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp597" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The perfect example is Kṛṣṇa's choosing Arjuna to fight the Battle of Ku&shy;ru&shy;kṣe&shy;tra. Kṛṣṇa did not use a <em>brāh&shy;ma&shy;ṇa</em> or <em>śūd&shy;ra</em> to do the work. He used a first-class <em>kṣa&shy;tri&shy;ya</em> warrior. Yet the material qualification was tempered by the spiritual qualification of full surrender. Kṛṣṇa could have also used Kar&shy;ṇa, for example, but He did not, because Kar&shy;ṇa was not a devotee of the Lord. Kṛṣṇa will use the surrendered soul who has some capacity to work for Him in the manner He desires.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> We expect from everyone whatever one can do. If you can do three hundred books a week and someone else can do seven hundred, then we expect three hundred and seven hundred respectively. Can everybody cook the same ecstatic feast? Not everyone is the same. Even if everybody were to have the same spirit, the result would still not be the same. Maybe you are surrendering fully, but someone else may be an expert in the art of controlling people. Still it is not only an art; <em>śak&shy;ti</em> is needed as well. It cannot be picked up out of the air or learned at the chalk board. There are also other factors, such as austerity and previous lives. We simply expect the best you can do, and to try your best is purity. If three hundred books is as much as you can do, and seven hundred books is as much as he can do, then equal! In the example of Ha&shy;nu&shy;mān and the spider, Lord Rā&shy;ma&shy;can&shy;dra accepted both equally, because both gave the best they had.

At other times he said that it is brah&shy;mi&shy;ni&shy;cal because it is teaching. It depends on how you do it. You have a <em>vai&shy;śya</em> mentality if you say, “I am collecting for the ants in Mesopotamia,” because you are using deception to get some money and then throwing a book at him. But distributing books the way you are supposed to, by straight preaching, is brah&shy;mi&shy;ni&shy;cal. You show him the book in your hand and present it on the basis of what the book says and explain why the book is good to read. Of course, Pra&shy;bhupāda said "by hook or by crook,” which implies that you can also do it with a <em>vai&shy;śya</em> mentality. But if you are strong enough, you can sell the book on its merits by speaking philosophically to the people. Selling the books on the basis of the books is brah&shy;mi&shy;ni&shy;cal, and doing it to make money may indicate a <em>vai&shy;śya</em> mentality, but book distribution itself is purely a Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;va activity.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> Book distribution itself has little to do with <em>var&shy;ṇā&shy;śra&shy;ma-dharma</em>.

Book distribution is pure, transcendental activity. Everyone talks about transcending the modes of nature; nothing is more transcendental than distributing books, and everything else is questionable. By the distribution of these books, people will understand that their speculations are resulting in a chaotic society and that they need <em>var&shy;ṇā&shy;śra&shy;ma-dharma</em> to properly organize society.

To give a gross example: a hungry person, even a young baby, knows exactly where and how to put food into the mouth. He doesn't have to think about it. Similarly, if you do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> with complete dedication to the lotus feet of your spiritual master and constantly meditate on distributing the books for his pleasure, you will automatically get the necessary determination and intelligence to present the books correctly. There will be no weak&shy;heart&shy;ed&shy;ness. You will dash right onto the battlefield, weapons in hand. With this dedication and daily meditation you will succeed. By praying, before the Deities or within the heart, “Please Kṛṣṇa, help me in this mission. Please, help me satisfy my spiritual master,” you will get the mercy and all good qualities will develop within you. This I have heard from great authorities.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> The goal of every devotee in the movement, whether he is distributing books or not, is to become steady in his service. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda wanted the devotees to be steady, so that they could become experts and have good results in their services. If you are always changing your service, you will not learn anything properly. Imagine having different cooks every day. No one would ever learn how to cook <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, and you would never be satisfied. The preaching department especially requires steadiness because preaching is so difficult, and of all the different types of preaching, book distribution requires the most steadiness. You must wait years before you become an expert. First you must meet many different kinds of people in many different circumstances, and then you must go on for the rest of your life, learning the art of surrender, which doesn't come cheaply. Every day you have to wake up and surrender. Therefore, steadiness is the most important quality of a devotee.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> Yes, distribute as much as you can, but when you start worrying about results, thinking that you should be number one, you are getting into trouble. Distribute out of love for the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, without expectation of results. If they want, they can cause you to do seventy books a day, or if they want, they can cause you to do seven books a day. Become a tool in the hands of Kṛṣṇa, and do not consider whether you are going to distribute a lot or not. Every day you should think, “Let's see what Kṛṣṇa arranges today. Maybe Kṛṣṇa will arrange for me to meet nice people, or maybe for my purification, He will arrange that I meet nasty people. Let us see what Kṛṣṇa has in store for me today.”

You are not a frui&shy;tive actor. Kṛṣṇa says in <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>: <em>kar&shy;ma&shy;ṇy evā&shy;dhi&shy;kā&shy;ras te mā pha&shy;le&shy;ṣu ka&shy;dā&shy;ca&shy;na</em>. You have a right to perform your <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> service, but you don't have a right to enjoy the results of your service. Leave the results up to Kṛṣṇa and don't be attached to not doing your service. Of course, if you are never doing very much, that's also not good. That means something is wrong in the surrendering department. But don't give up, thinking that you cannot do very much anyway. You should go on and try to improve, but you should not be attached to the results. One attached to the results can only go on for a short time, maybe a year or two. If you are attached to the results, and the results and your expectation do not match, you will become discouraged, your results will dwindle even more, and you will fall down from the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> service.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> The temple has economic requirements, and your responsibility to the temple is to try to do as much as you can.

I personally never push the book distributors to fulfill quotas. Transcendental competitions are better. The distributors do not compete for sense gratification or glorification, and they surrender to the service and distribute as much as they can to please Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master.

</div>
<div id="pp622" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

Since the authorities have opinions on how much you should do, you can tell them, “I'll try my best to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and not be a disturbance to the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, but the results are up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not me. Let's see what happens.” I think they will accept that. After all, it is the duty of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees to pass on to the authorities and others their realizations on how to work without frui&shy;tive results. Only the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees can understand that art well, because every day they have to meet good and rotten people on the street and be completely detached from how many books they are going to distribute.
</p>

<div id="pp623" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
If you distribute completely free from frui&shy;tive desires and your heart's only desire is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, then the books will start flying out of your hands, because you are not distributing anymore, Kṛṣṇa is. As long as you think that you are distributing the books, you are going to have a hard time. People will push you down, spit on you, or slap you in the face—and unless you are free from frui&shy;tive desires, you will fall apart.

If you want the books to go out of your hands in a transcendental way, you have to understand that it is all up to Kṛṣṇa and become a tool of the Supreme Lord. But that doesn't mean you have nothing to do with it. Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: <em>ma&shy;yai&shy;vai&shy;te ni&shy;ha&shy;tāḥ pūr&shy;vam eva ni&shy;mit&shy;ta-māt&shy;raṁ bha&shy;va sa&shy;vya-sācin</em>. Kṛṣṇa called Arjuna “Sa&shy;vya&shy;sā&shy;cī,” or one expert in shooting arrows. He said, “By My arrangement, these men are already put to death, so you can become but an instrument in the fight, O Sa&shy;vya&shy;sā&shy;cī.” Although Kṛṣṇa used Arjuna's expertise to do a service in which the result was already fixed, that didn't mean Arjuna had nothing to do with it. He did, but his service was to be Kṛṣṇa's tool. As Kṛṣṇa's tool, you should do your best, but let Kṛṣṇa use you. That is the secret of success. You have the ability to distribute a book, so let Kṛṣṇa use your abilities as if you were an instrument in His hands.

<div id="pp625" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

Becoming the tool of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult because the false ego is always telling us, “You are great. You are an important personality. You are going to distribute these books. You. You. You.” Others may drag you into this bodily conception of life too: "How many did you do today? You are really great!” A sure way to fall into <em>māyā</em> is to start believing what they say, instead of remembering that you are just a tool, an agency through which Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's mercy can work to distribute these books to the fallen souls and nothing more. You should never want to be anything more, because that's already the most exalted position in the universe. Arjuna was Kṛṣṇa's tool, and look what happened! He became the most exalted personality in all three worlds by destroying his opponents on the Battlefield of Ku&shy;ru&shy;kṣe&shy;tra; he is glorified to this day, five thousand years later. Similarly, you too can attain perfection in your service by becoming Kṛṣṇa's tool.

You have to give up the feeling that you are the doer and accept within your heart that although you try your best, Kṛṣṇa is responsible for the results. After a while, you will realize, “Kṛṣṇa is doing it. I have no problems. I just go out, and Kṛṣṇa makes things happen as He always does.” Then you will never want to feel anything other than the ecstatic feeling of being a tool of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> On the weekend we had a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> meeting. Different devotees spoke on the theme, “I am not the doer; everything is dependent on Kṛṣṇa.” One devotee made the point that in the material world, the Su&shy;per&shy;soul is controlling everything, including the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee on the street, who mainly deals with the Su&shy;per&shy;soul.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp630" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But a devotee is not only dealing with the Su&shy;per&shy;soul. If we approach the Bha&shy;ga&shy;vān feature of the Lord, then He will personally reciprocate, <em>ye ya&shy;thā māṁ pra&shy;pa&shy;dyan&shy;te</em>. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda also explains in the preface of <em>Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya-ca&shy;ri&shy;tā&shy;mṛ&shy;ta</em>, "The Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is already in charge of the maintenance of this creation by virtue of His plenary expansion, Kṣī&shy;ro&shy;da&shy;ka&shy;śā&shy;yī Viṣ&shy;ṇu, but this maintenance is not direct.

Someone else said that the devotee doesn't carry the Su&shy;per&shy;soul in his heart, but Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Himself. So how far can we say that Kṛṣṇa personally takes charge?

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> The desire to satisfy the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa is a good desire, and to want to do it by distributing more books is also a good desire. You should always think, “I want to do more for their satisfaction,” but never be satisfied with the result. They are always asking you to do more. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda didn't say, “Just go out and do whatever you can.” He said, “Go out and double it.” This desire to double it is not frui&shy;tive, because it is a desire to please and satisfy the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. But if you want to do more so that you can come back and boast about how many books you have given out, then that desire is frui&shy;tive, because you are trying to be the en&shy;joy&shy;er of the activity. You should pray to Kṛṣṇa to allow you to distribute many books for the satisfaction of your spiritual master. Then whatever you do will be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Although you may be a little frustrated that you cannot do more, you are pleasing the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa with your steady service, and you will get the mercy.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> This question is best answered by you, not by me, but I can give you a hint. When you are very tired, or when the body lacks energy due to bad health, the mind will represent the body and say, “Don't go out so long, you are too weak.” But sometimes the mind, on its own, without being influenced by the body, says, "Oh, what is the use of all this? Why go out anyway?” There is a difference between the two. In the first case you are thinking, “This is a wonderful service. I want to do it, but somehow I am not getting it together.” In the second case you are thinking, "What is the use? Who cares? I don't want to do it.” In this second case, it is only the mind. But if you are having trouble performing devotional service because the body is weak, you should do something about it. Find a good doctor, get some medicine, and take some rest. Then, after the result has come, go back to your service. If the body is broken down completely, the mind may argue in both of the above-mentioned ways and the cause may be hard to distinguish. A sincere devotee will try to go on with his service, but the other devotees may notice that he is unable to perform his service because of weakness, and they may demand that he take care of himself.

We were trying to solve the problem by fighting legal battles, but things were not changing. I even arranged for the lawyer who had helped legalize book distribution in the United States airports to come to Germany. He made a thick book of plans on how to defeat the laws in Germany. I took one look at this book and knew that this was not the right way. Instead we just kept going and depended on Kṛṣṇa, and within two years, we had very little trouble with the police.

On the street you should be a perfect gentleman and not a disturbance. If you are pushy or if you try to cheat people, you will get bad reactions. For example, in the past some devotees used the "change-up" method. Once in 1976 or 1977, I was traveling from Germany and my plane had to make an emergency landing at the Chicago Airport. Since I was stranded there, I decided to take advantage of the situation. I had heard about some of the distribution methods being used in America, so I phoned up the president of the Chicago temple and asked him how I could find out what it was like to be "changed-up.” He told me to stand underneath the main departure and arrival board and look stupid. I disguised myself as an ordinary, spaced-out <em>kar&shy;mī</em>, looking at the board. Within no time I got my wish fulfilled: a distributor girl approached me. As she tried to pin a flower on my shirt, she babbled some nonsense about collecting money for some cause. But I kept saying that I did not want to give her any money, so she asked me if I could change some small bills for a fifty-dollar-bill. Although the temple president had warned me that this would happen, I handed her a fifty-dollar-bill. She slowly gave back the change, one dollar here, five dollars there—until she got to about thirty dollars. Then she said, “Why don't we leave it at that, for charity?" and I said, “No, I don't want to give any charity.” Again, after another five dollars, she said, "Why don't we leave it at that?" and she started walking away, adding, “By the way, where are you from?” When I told her, “From the temple at Schloss Ret&shy;ter&shy;shof, Germany,” she gasped and froze in her tracks. “I'm Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami,” I said. "Give me back my fifty dollars.”

When I came back to Germany, I told the devotees that they should never, under any circumstances, cheat people. It is a horrible experience. We would rather distribute five hundred books less each week than make money by cheating. As soon as people realize that they have been cheated, they get angry and tell the police. They tell their friends and their family, and we become known as cheaters. Therefore we should distribute the books in a straightforward way, as gentlemen and ladies. Many points in our philosophy address topics that people are interested in. If we preach the philosophy directly, then problems with the police will gradually disappear.

Should we be completely “up front” when trying to get donations for books?

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> “Up front” does not mean stupid.

I have come to take <em>lakṣ&shy;mi</em> from you! Please give it here!” They will throw you out the door. However, if you tell the people, “I'm trying to spread love of God” or “I'm trying to do something beneficial for human society," then you are following the brah&shy;mi&shy;ni&shy;cal principle, <em>sat&shy;yaṁ bru&shy;yāt pri&shy;yaṁ bru&shy;yāt</em>: “Truth should be spoken pa&shy;la&shy;tably, and unpalatable truth should not be spoken.” A person who cannot take Kṛṣṇa directly has to be given Kṛṣṇa in another way. You can give Kṛṣṇa consciousness in many ways. If you have a little expertise, you will not disturb the person. The point is to give him a book. If you tell him something about Kṛṣṇa and he says, “Kṛṣṇa, forget it!" and doesn't take a book, then you have ruined his opportunity.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> If you read and appreciate the books, you will have faith in them. When you have faith in the books, you can impart that faith to others. There were times when the devotees in Germany were also having negative feelings. In 1976, I printed one hundred thousand <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books.

The devotees were coming to me shaking in their boots: “It says on the cover, <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead</em>. How can we distribute these books?" So I made fun of them. I said that when they handed the book to someone, they would try to cover up the title with their thumb, because they would not want anyone to see that it says "Kṛṣṇa" on the cover. When you are paranoid and you think it is bad, the person on the street will immediately sense that something is wrong and not take the book. But the same person will react differently when you are not hung up about the title and you go out with full faith, thinking, "This is a book about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whoever reads this book will like it.” The German devotees had not been distributing many books, and all of a sudden they increased. After a week or two of preaching, our <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees sold all one hundred thousand <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books in a month or so. The change was due to the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books alone. The devotees just went out and distributed like crazy, running around all day in complete ecstasy selling <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books.

You can tell people that the books contain stories from the Ve&shy;dic literature about wonderful personalities from the past, stories that their children will also like.

Of course, we were only distributing the small paperback <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books for a dollar. When I got bored with repeating the same words, I would say, “We are <em>sādhus</em>,” or, “We are the <em>ta&shy;ṭa&shy;stha-śak&shy;ti</em> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Amazingly, nobody objected. I sold the most on days when I was running from person to person, throwing books into their arms. People would buy them, but I don't know how. If someone asks me how I distributed books, I cannot precisely remember. Sometimes I used to say, “These books are fantastic. If you don't have any other book but this one, your life will be perfect.

Distributing books often has nothing to do with what you say but who you are. You can say exactly what a devotee who can distribute many books says, but when you say it the effect will be different. It is a question of personality. Some devotees have a personality that the people like, so they buy a book. The most important thing is to be natural. You should be well dressed, but don't try to put on an artificial show of who you are, who you think you are, or who you want the people to think you are. Just be yourself and be friendly. By being a friendly devotee, people will be attracted to you.

I personally wouldn't mind if everybody were just distributing books; I would go from one traveling party to another and have an enormously good time. But we also have to publish books, and publishing books demands time and energy. Other problems, such as family life and big temples, also demand time and energy. There has to be a place for everyone in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because not everyone will go out and distribute books. But from our point of view, we would love it if there was only book distribution.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> In the future we will also distribute books. We will distribute until everyone in the world has a full set of books. Then we will start to distribute spare sets, in case they lose the books or their dog eats them. Unlimited amounts of books can be distributed. Don't think that soon everybody will have books; it will take at least a hundred years. And besides, books don't last forever, so we have to distribute new ones too.

<strong>Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami:</strong> What a terrible problem! You will go to every door and teach the people what it says in the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>. You will give them <em>Śrī&shy;mad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>, and when they all have <em>Śrī&shy;mad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>, you will give them the <em>Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya-ca&shy;ri&shy;tā&shy;mṛ&shy;ta</em>. When everyone is finished reading the <em>Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya-ca&shy;ri&shy;tā&shy;mṛ&shy;ta</em>, we will have a billion-person <em>kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and this earth planet will float right out of the universe.
