<!--  
      Next is the external script which creates and plays the game
      This is where we can change canvas size, layout, colors, and css for the 
      result announcement. 
      The script was originally obfuscated so all function and variable names
      are meaningless, but it's not difficult to locate the important parts.
     
      Line 186 is where it all starts. Variables in that section
      are self-explanatory and code is easy to read.
      Line 218 is settings for fonts and colors
      Line 770 is where result announcement is created

      There could be some legacy functions there left
      but I think I've deleted anything that is not used.
