                            <div id="bb79370" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this chapter, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa describes to Uddhava the difference between conditioned and liberated living entities, the characteristics of a saintly person and the different aspects of the practice of devotional service.</p></div>
                        
                            

                            <div id="bb79371" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous chapter Uddhava had presented questions regarding conditioned and liberated souls. In His replies, the almighty Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa states that although the spirit soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, on account of his infinitesimal nature, he falls into contact with the material energy, which causes him to accept the covering designations of the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Thus the soul has been bound up since time immemorial. But when he achieves the shelter of pure devotional service, he becomes designated as eternally liberated. Transcendental knowledge is therefore the cause of the living entity’s liberation, and ignorance is the cause of his bondage. Both knowledge and ignorance are produced by the <i>māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i> energy of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and are His eternal potencies. The living entities who become attracted to the modes of nature are bewildered by false ego, which causes them to see themselves as the enjoyers of misery, confusion, happiness, distress, danger, and so on. In this way, they meditate upon such states of being, although in the real, or spiritual, world these things do not exist. Both the <i>jīva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span></i> (individual soul) and the Supersoul reside within the same body. The difference between them is that the almighty Supersoul, being fully cognizant, does not indulge in enjoying the fruits of material work but remains simply as a witness, whereas the infinitesimal conditioned <i>jīva, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว,</span></i> being ignorant, suffers the consequences of his own work. The liberated <i>jīva,</i> in spite of being within a material body because of the remaining reactions of his past activities, does not become disturbed by the happiness and suffering of the body. He sees such bodily experiences in the same way that a person who has just awakened from a dream sees his dream experiences. On the other hand, although the conditioned living entity is by nature not the enjoyer of the happiness and misery of the body, he imagines himself to be the enjoyer of his bodily experiences, just as a person in a dream imagines his dream experiences to be real. Just as the sun reflected upon water is not actually bound up in the water, and just as the air is not confined to some particular segment of the sky, similarly a detached person takes advantage of his broad outlook on the world to cut off all his doubts with the sword of appropriate renunciation, <i>yukta-vairāgya. - <span style="color:#990012">ยุกฺต-ไวราคฺย.</span></i> Since his life force, senses, mind and intelligence have no tendency to fix themselves on sense objects, he remains liberated even while situated within the material body. Regardless of whether he is harassed or worshiped, he remains equipoised. He is therefore considered liberated even in this life. A liberated person has nothing to do with the piety and sin of this world, but rather sees everything equally. A self-satisfied sage does not praise or condemn anyone. He does not speak uselessly to anyone and does not fix his mind on material things. Rather, he is always merged in meditation upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so in the eyes of fools he seems to be a speechless, crazy person.</p></div>
                        
                            

                            <div id="bb79372" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Even if someone has studied or even taught all the different Vedic literatures, if he has not developed pure attraction to the service of the Personality of Godhead, he has accomplished nothing beyond his own labor. One should study only those scriptures in which the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, His enchanting pastimes and the nectarean topics of His various incarnations are scientifically discussed; thus one gains the highest good fortune. However, by studying scriptures other than these one simply acquires misfortune.</p></div>
                        
                            

                            <div id="bb79373" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>With full determination one should properly understand the identity of the soul and give up false identification with this material body. He may then offer his heart at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of all love, and attain real peace. When the mind is carried away by the three modes of nature, it can no longer meditate properly on the transcendental Supreme Truth. After many lifetimes, faithful persons who have performed Vedic sacrifices for acquiring religiosity, economic development and sense gratification finally engage in hearing, chanting and constantly thinking of the Supreme Lord’s all-auspicious pastimes, which purify the entire universe. Such persons then achieve the association of a bona fide spiritual master and the saintly devotees. After that, by the mercy of the spiritual master they begin to follow the paths set out by the standard authorities of spiritual life, the <i>mahājanas, - <span style="color:#990012">มหาชนสฺ,</span></i> and become actually perfect in realization of their own true identity.</p></div>
                        
                            

                            <div id="bb79374" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Having heard these instructions from Lord Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava further desired to understand the characteristics of a factually saintly person and the different aspects of devotional practice. Lord Kṛṣṇa replied that a real <i>sādhu - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ,</span></i> or Vaiṣṇava, is qualified with the following characteristics. He is merciful, nonenvious, always truthful, self-controlled, faultless, magnanimous, gentle, clean, nonpossessive, helpful to all, peaceful, dependent on Kṛṣṇa alone, free from lust, devoid of material endeavor, steady, in control of the six enemies of the mind, moderate in eating, never bewildered, always respectful to others, never desirous of respect for himself, sober, compassionate, friendly, poetic, expert and silent. The principal characteristic of a <i>sādhu</i> is that he takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa alone. One who engages exclusively in Kṛṣṇa’s service and understands Him as the limitless, indwelling Lord who comprises eternity, knowledge and bliss, is the topmost devotee. The practice of devotional service includes sixty-four kinds of activities. Among these are: (1-6) seeing, touching, worshiping, serving, glorifying and offering obeisances to the Deity of the Lord and His pure devotees; (7) developing attachment for hearing the chanting of the Lord’s qualities, pastimes, and so on; (8) remaining always in meditation upon the Lord; (9) offering everything one acquires to the Lord; (10) accepting oneself to be the Lord’s servant; (11) offering the Lord one’s heart and soul; (12) engaging in glorification of the Lord’s birth and activities; (13) observing holidays related to the Lord; (14) performing festivals in the Lord’s temple in the company of other devotees, and with music, singing and dancing; (15) celebrating all varieties of yearly functions; (16) offering foodstuffs to the Lord; (17) taking initiation according to the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> and <i>tantras; - <span style="color:#990012">ตนฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> (18) taking vows related to the Lord; (19) being eager to establish Deities of the Lord; (20) endeavoring either alone or in association with others in constructing, for the service of the Lord, vegetable and flower gardens, temples, cities, and so on; (21) humbly cleansing the temple of the Lord; and (22) rendering service to the Lord’s house by painting it, washing it with water and decorating it with auspicious designs.</p></div>

        Purport
    </h2>
    

        <div id="bb79380" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this chapter the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, explains the different characteristics of conditioned and liberated life, the symptoms by which one can recognize saintly persons, and the various processes of devotional service to the Lord. In the previous chapter, Uddhava inquired from the Lord how conditioned and liberated life are possible. The Lord now replies that Uddhava’s question is somewhat superficial, since the pure spirit soul is never entangled in the material energy of the Lord. The living entity imagines a false connection with the three modes of nature and accepts the material body as the self. The living entity therefore suffers the consequences of his own imagination, just as one suffers the illusory activities of a dream. This does not indicate that the material world is illusory in the sense that it is nonexistent. The material world is certainly real, being the potency of the Personality of Godhead, and the living entity, being the superior potency of God, is also real. But the living entity’s dream of being part and parcel of the material world is an illusion that drags him into the contradictory state called material conditioned life. The living entity is never actually <i>baddha, - <span style="color:#990012">พทฺธ,</span></i> or bound up, since he merely imagines a false connection with the material world.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79381" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Because there is ultimately no permanent connection between the living entity and matter, there is no actual liberation - <span style="color:#990012">ลิเพรตินฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ลิเพรตินฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ลิเพรตินฺ</span>. The living entity, being eternally transcendental to the inferior material energy of the Lord, is eternally liberated. Lord Kṛṣṇa reveals that in one sense the living entity is factually not bound up and thus cannot be liberated. But in another sense, the terms <i>bondage - <span style="color:#990012">โพนฺทเค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โพนฺทเค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โพนฺทเค</span></i> and <i>liberation</i> can be conveniently applied to indicate the particular situation of the individual soul, who is the marginal potency of the Lord. Although the individual soul is never actually bound to matter, he suffers the reactions of material nature because of false identification, and thus the term <i>baddha - <span style="color:#990012">พทฺธ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">พทฺธ,</span></i> or “bound up,” may be used to indicate the nature of a living entity’s experience within the inferior energy of the Lord. Since <i>baddha</i> describes a false situation, freedom from such a false situation may also be described as <i>mokṣa, - <span style="color:#990012">โมกฺษ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โมกฺษ,</span></i> or liberation. Therefore the terms <i>bondage</i> and <i>liberation</i> are acceptable if one understands that such terms only refer to temporary situations created by illusion and do not refer to the ultimate nature of the living entity. In this verse Lord Kṛṣṇa states, <i>guṇasya māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span>-mūlatvān na me mokṣo na bandhanam: - <span style="color:#990012">คุณสฺย มายา-มูลตฺวานฺ น เม โมโกฺษ น พนฺธนมฺ:</span></i> the terms <i>liberation</i> and <i>bondage</i> can never be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, since He is the Absolute Truth and the supreme controller of everything. Lord Kṛṣṇa is eternally the supreme transcendental entity, and He can never be bound by illusion. It is the duty of the illusory potency of the Personality of Godhead to attract the living entities to ignorance by creating the false impression of a blissful existence separate from Lord Kṛṣṇa. The illusory conception of existence apart from the Personality of Godhead is called <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> or material illusion. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme absolute controller of <i>māyā,</i> there is no possibility that <i>māyā</i> could have any influence over the Personality of Godhead. Thus the term <i>bandhanam, - <span style="color:#990012">พนฺธนมฺ,</span></i> or “bondage,” cannot be applied to the eternal, blissful and omniscient Personality of Godhead. The term <i>mokṣa,</i> or “liberation,” indicating freedom from <i>bandhana, - <span style="color:#990012">พนฺธน,</span></i> is equally irrelevant to the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79382" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has commented on this verse as follows. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is endowed with great spiritual potencies. Because of mundane concoction, the conditioned soul imagines that the Absolute Truth is devoid of variegated spiritual potencies by which He may enjoy blissful life. Although the living entity is the spiritual potency of the Lord, he is presently situated in the inferior, illusory potency, and by engaging in mental speculation he becomes bound in conditioned life. Liberation means that the living entity should transfer himself to the spiritual potency of the Lord, which can be divided into three categories — <i>hlādinī, - <span style="color:#990012">หฺลาทินี,</span></i> the potency of bliss; <i>sandhinī, - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺธินี,</span></i> the potency of eternal existence; and <i>saṁvit, - <span style="color:#990012">สํวิตฺ,</span></i> the potency of omniscience. Since the Personality of Godhead is eternally endowed with a pure existence of bliss and knowledge, He is never conditioned or liberated. The living entity, however, being entangled in the Lord’s material potency, is sometimes conditioned and sometimes liberated.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79383" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The neutral, original state of the three modes of nature is called <i>māyā. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i> When the three modes of nature interact, one of them will become powerful, subordinating the other two modes until another mode becomes prominent. In this way, the three can be distinguished in their variety of manifestation. Although the threefold material potency expands from the Personality of Godhead, the Lord Himself in His personal form is the actual abode of the three spiritual potencies, namely eternality, bliss and knowledge. If one desires to become free from the entanglement of conditioned life within the material sky, called the kingdom of <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> one must come to the spiritual sky, wherein the living entities are filled with bliss, possess eternal spiritual bodies and engage in the loving devotional service of the Lord. By developing one’s eternal, spiritual form in the loving service of the Lord, one immediately transcends the duality of conditioned life and impersonal liberation and can directly experience the spiritual potencies of the Lord. At that time there is no possibility of false identification with the material world.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79384" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Realizing oneself to be eternal spirit soul, the living entity can understand that he is never truly connected to matter, because he is part of the superior energy of the Lord. Therefore, both material bondage and liberation are ultimately meaningless within the reality of the spiritual sky. The living entity is the marginal potency of the Lord and should exercise his free will to engage in the pure devotional service of the Lord. By reviving one’s eternal, spiritual body one can understand oneself to be a minute particle of the spiritual potency of the Lord. In other words, the living entity is a minute particle of eternity, bliss and omniscience, and thus in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no possibility of his being carried away by the illusion of the three modes of nature. In conclusion, it may be stated that the individual living entity is never actually entangled in matter and is thus not liberated, although his illusory state may be accurately described as entangled and liberated. On the other hand, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is eternally situated in His own spiritual potencies and can never be described as being bound up, and thus there is no meaning to the concept of the Lord’s freeing Himself from such a nonexistent condition.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79389" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>deha-āpattiḥ - <span style="color:#990012">เทห-อาปตฺติฮ</span></i> indicates that the living entity falsely identifies himself with the external material body and thus transmigrates from one body to another. <i>Āpatti - <span style="color:#990012">อาปตฺติ</span></i> also indicates great suffering or misfortune. Because of such false identification under the influence of illusion, the living entity experiences the miserable symptoms described here. <i>Māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i> means the false concept that anything can exist without Lord Kṛṣṇa or for any purpose other than the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Although the conditioned living entities are trying to enjoy material sense gratification, the result is always painful, and such painful experiences turn the conditioned soul back toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In other words, the ultimate purpose of the material creation is to bring the living entity back to the loving devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, even the sufferings of the material world may be seen as the transcendental mercy of the Personality of Godhead. The conditioned soul, imagining that material objects are meant for his personal enjoyment, bitterly laments the loss of such objects. In this verse, the example is given of a dream in which the material intelligence creates many illusory objects. Similarly, our polluted material consciousness creates the false impression of material sense gratification, but this phantasmagoria, being devoid of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, has no real existence. By surrendering to polluted material consciousness, the living entity is afflicted with innumerable troubles. The only solution is to see Lord Kṛṣṇa within everything and everything within Lord Kṛṣṇa. Thus, one understands that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer, the proprietor of everything and the well-wishing friend of all living beings.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79390" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In material illusion there is no understanding of one’s eternal, spiritual body, nor is there knowledge of the Absolute Truth. Therefore, material existence, even in its most sophisticated or pious form, is always foolishness. One should not misunderstand the example of the dream to mean that the material world has no real existence. Material nature is the manifestation of the Lord’s external potency, just as the spiritual sky is the manifestation of the Lord’s internal potency. Although material objects are subject to transformation and thus have no permanent existence, the material energy is real because it comes from the supreme reality, Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is only our false acceptance of the material body as the factual self and our foolish dream that the material world is meant for our pleasure that have no real existence. They are merely mental concoctions. One should cleanse oneself of material designations and wake up to the all-pervading reality of the Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79395" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>By the expansion of <i>vidyā, - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา,</span></i> or knowledge, a conditioned soul is liberated from the clutches of <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> and similarly, by the expansion of <i>avidyā, - <span style="color:#990012">อวิทฺยา,</span></i> or ignorance, the conditioned soul is driven further into illusion and bondage. Both knowledge and ignorance are products of the mighty potency of the Personality of Godhead. The living being is bound by illusion when he considers himself the proprietor of the subtle and gross material bodies. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī the living entity may be designated as <i>jīva-māyā - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-มายา</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-มายา,</span></i> whereas matter is called <i>guṇa-māyā - <span style="color:#990012">คุณ-มายา</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">คุณ-มายา.</span></i> The living entity places his living potency (<i>jīva-māyā</i>) in the grip of the mundane qualitative potency (<i>guṇa-māyā</i>) and falsely dreams that he is part and parcel of the material world. Such an artificial mixture is called illusion or ignorance. When all of the Lord’s potencies are correctly perceived in their proper categories, the living entity is liberated from material bondage and returns to his blissful eternal residence in the spiritual sky.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79396" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead is not different from His potencies, yet He is always above them as the supreme controller. The Supreme Personality of Godhead may be designated as <i>mukta, - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺต,</span></i> or liberated, only to indicate that He is eternally free from material contamination and never to indicate that the Lord has been freed from actual entanglement in a material situation. According to Śrīla Madhvācārya, <i>vidyā - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา</span></i> indicates the goddess of fortune, the internal potency of the Lord, whereas <i>avidyā - <span style="color:#990012">อวิทฺยา</span></i> indicates Durgā, the external potency of the Lord. Ultimately, however, the Personality of Godhead can transform His potencies according to His own desire, as explained by Śrīla Prabhupāda in his commentary on <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.3.34), “Because the Lord is the absolute Transcendence, all of His forms, names, pastimes, attributes, associates and energies are identical with Him. His transcendental energy acts according to His omnipotency. The same energy acts as His external, internal and marginal energies, and by His omnipotency He can perform anything and everything through the agency of any of the above energies. He can turn the external energy into internal by His will.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79397" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī notes in this regard that although the Lord has explained in the first verse of this chapter that the living entity is never actually in bondage - <span style="color:#990012">โพนฺทเค</span>, and therefore never actually liberated, one may apply the terms <i>bondage</i> and <i>liberation - <span style="color:#990012">ลิเพรตินฺ</span></i> if one remembers that the living entity is eternally a transcendental fragment of the Personality of Godhead. Further, one should not misinterpret the words <i>māyayā me vinirmite - <span style="color:#990012">มายยา เม วินิรฺมิเต</span></i> to indicate that both material bondage and liberation are temporary states, being creations of the potency of the Lord. Therefore, the term <i>ādye, - <span style="color:#990012">อาเทฺย,</span></i> or “primeval and eternal,” is used in this verse. The <i>vidyā - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา</span></i> and <i>avidyā - <span style="color:#990012">อวิทฺยา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อวิทฺยา</span></i> potencies of the Lord are stated to be creations of <i>māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i> because they carry out the functions of the Lord’s potencies. The <i>vidyā</i> potency engages the living entities in the Lord’s pastimes, whereas the <i>avidyā</i> potency engages the living entities in forgetting the Lord and merging into darkness. Actually, both knowledge and ignorance are eternal alternatives of the marginal potency of the Lord, and in this sense it is not incorrect to state that the living entity is either eternally conditioned or eternally liberated. The term <i>vinirmite, - <span style="color:#990012">วินิรฺมิเต,</span></i> or “produced,” in this case indicates that the Lord expands His own energy as knowledge and ignorance, which display the functions of the Lord’s internal and external potencies. Such potential exhibitions may appear and disappear in different times, places and circumstances, but material bondage and spiritual freedom are eternal options of the marginal potency of the Lord.</p></div>

Such conditioned life, however, is not endless, since the living entity may achieve liberation through the loving devotional service of the Lord. Since the living entity may acquire liberation, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura states that his liberated life begins at a certain point but is endless, because liberated life is understood to be eternal. In any case, one who has achieved the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, may be understood to be eternally liberated, since such a person has entered into the eternal atmosphere of the spiritual sky. Since there is no material time in the spiritual sky, one who has achieved his eternal spiritual body on Lord Kṛṣṇa’s planet is not subject to the influence of time. His eternal blissful life with Kṛṣṇa is not designated in terms of material past, present and future and is therefore called eternal liberation. Material time is conspicuous by its absence in the spiritual sky, and every living entity there is eternally liberated, having attained the supreme situation. Such liberation can be achieved by <i>vidyā, - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา,</span></i> or perfect knowledge, which is understood in three phases called Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, as described in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> The ultimate phase of <i>vidyā,</i> or knowledge, is to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

        <div id="bb79418" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The example of two birds in the same tree is given to illustrate the presence within the heart of the material body of both the individual soul and the Supersoul, the Personality of Godhead. Just as a bird makes a nest in a tree, the living entity sits within the heart. The example is appropriate because the bird is always distinct from the tree. Similarly, both the individual soul and the Supersoul are distinct entities, separate from the temporary material body. The word <i>balena - <span style="color:#990012">พเลน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พเลน</span></i> indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is satisfied by His own internal potency, which consists of eternality, omniscience and bliss. As indicated by the word <i>bhūyān, - <span style="color:#990012">ภูยานฺ,</span></i> or “having superior existence,” the Supreme Lord is always in a superior position, whereas the living entity is sometimes in illusion and sometimes enlightened. The word <i>balena</i> indicates that the Lord is never in darkness or ignorance, but is always full in His perfect, blissful consciousness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79419" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Thus, the Lord is <i>niranna, - <span style="color:#990012">นิรนฺน,</span></i> or uninterested in the bitter fruits of material activities, whereas the ordinary conditioned soul busily consumes such bitter fruits, thinking them to be sweet. Ultimately, the fruit of all material endeavor is death, but the living entity foolishly thinks material things will bring him pleasure. The word <i>sakhāyau, - <span style="color:#990012">สขายะอุ,</span></i> or “two friends,” is also significant. Our real friend is Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is situated within our heart. Only He knows our actual needs, and only He can give us real happiness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79420" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He patiently sits in the heart, trying to guide the conditioned soul back home, back to Godhead. Certainly no material friend would remain with his foolish companion for millions of years, especially if his companion were to ignore him or even curse him. But Lord Kṛṣṇa is such a faithful, loving friend that He accompanies even the most demoniac living entity and is also in the heart of the insect, pig and dog. That is because Lord Kṛṣṇa is supremely Kṛṣṇa conscious and sees every living entity as part and parcel of Himself. Every living being should give up the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence. One should turn one’s face to the Lord within the heart and revive one’s eternal loving relationship with one’s real friend, Lord Kṛṣṇa. The word <i>sadṛśau, - <span style="color:#990012">สทฺฤศะอุ,</span></i> or “of similar nature,” indicates that both the living entity and the Personality of Godhead are conscious entities. As part and parcel of the Lord we share the Lord’s nature, but in infinitesimal quantity.

The example of two birds in a tree, which is given in many Vedic literatures, demonstrates the statement <i>nityo nityānām: - <span style="color:#990012">นิโตฺย นิตฺยานามฺ:</span></i> there are two categories of eternal living entities, namely the Supreme Lord and the minute <i>jīva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span></i> soul. The conditioned <i>jīva</i> soul, forgetting his identity as an eternal servant of the Lord, tries to enjoy the fruits of his own activities and thus comes under the spell of ignorance. This bondage of ignorance has existed since time immemorial and can be rectified only by one’s taking to the loving devotional service of the Lord, which is full of spiritual knowledge. In conditioned life the living entity is forced by the laws of nature to engage in pious and impious fruitive activities, but the liberated position of every living entity is to offer the fruits of his work to the Lord, the supreme enjoyer. It should be understood that even when the living entity is in a liberated condition, his knowledge is never equal in quantity to that of the Personality of Godhead. Even Lord Brahmā, the supreme living entity within this universe, acquires only partial knowledge of the Personality of Godhead and His potencies. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (4.5), the Lord explains His superior knowledge to Arjuna:</p></div>

According to Śrīla Madhvācārya, the Lord is the only eternally free living entity, and all other living entities are eternally dependent and bound to the Lord, either through blissful loving service or through the bondage of <i>māyā. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i> The conditioned soul should give up tasting the bitter fruits of the tree of material existence and turn to his dearmost friend, Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is sitting within his heart.

        <div id="bb79435" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In Lord Kṛṣṇa’s discussion of the different characteristics of liberated and conditioned souls, the Lord first clarified the distinction between the eternally liberated Personality of Godhead and the marginal potency, the innumerable <i>jīva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span>s, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีวสฺ,</span></i> who are sometimes conditioned and sometimes liberated. In this and the next nine verses, the Lord describes the different symptoms of liberated and conditioned <i>jīva</i> souls. In a dream one sees oneself in an imaginary body, but upon waking one gives up all identification with that body. Similarly, one who has awakened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness no longer identifies with the gross or subtle material bodies, nor does he become affected by the happiness and distress of material life. On the other hand, a foolish person (<i>kumati - <span style="color:#990012">กุมติ</span></i>) does not awaken from the dream of material existence and is afflicted with innumerable problems due to false identification with the gross and subtle material bodies. One should become situated in one’s eternal spiritual identity (<i>nitya-svarūpa - <span style="color:#990012">นิตฺย-สฺวรูป</span></i>). By properly identifying oneself as the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, one becomes relieved of his false material identity, and therefore the miseries of illusory existence immediately cease, just as the anxiety of a troublesome dream ceases as soon as one awakens to his normal, pleasant surroundings. It should be understood, however, that the analogy of awakening from a dream can never be applied to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never in illusion. The Lord is eternally awake and enlightened in His own unique category called <i>viṣṇu-tattva. - <span style="color:#990012">วิษฺณุ-ตตฺตฺว.</span></i> Such knowledge is easily understood by one who is <i>vidvān, - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺวานฺ,</span></i> or enlightened in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79456" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous chapter, Uddhava asked Lord Kṛṣṇa why an enlightened person, just like a conditioned soul, engages in external bodily functions. Here is the Lord’s answer. While engaged in bodily functions, an unintelligent person is attached to both the means and end of material life and therefore experiences intense lamentation and jubilation on the material platform. A self-realized soul, however, studies the inevitable defeat and suffering of ordinary persons and does not make the mistake of trying to enjoy the bodily functions even slightly. He instead remains a detached witness, merely engaging his senses in the normal functions of bodily maintenance. As indicated here by the word <i>ādayan, - <span style="color:#990012">อาทยนฺ,</span></i> he engages something other than his actual self in material experience.</p></div>

Similarly, the sun is not at all attached to the water in which it is reflected within innumerable reservoirs, and the mighty wind blowing everywhere is not affected by the innumerable aromas and atmospheres through which it passes. In the same way, a self-realized soul is completely detached from the material body and the material world around it. He is like a person who has awakened and arisen from a dream. With expert vision sharpened by detachment, the self-realized soul cuts all doubts to pieces through knowledge of the self and completely withdraws his consciousness from the expansion of material variety.</strong></p></div>

        <div id="bb79461" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, a self-realized soul cuts all doubts to pieces by direct experience of his true spiritual identity. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Lord Kṛṣṇa, and there is no possibility of any existence separate from Lord Kṛṣṇa. Such expert knowledge cuts all doubts to pieces. As stated here, <i>prakṛti-stho ’py asaṁsaktaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤติโ-สฺตฺห′ปฺยฺ อสํสกฺตฮ:</span></i> like the sky, the sun or the wind, one who is self-realized is not entangled, though situated within the material creation of the Lord. <i>Nānātva, - <span style="color:#990012">นานาตฺว,</span></i> or “material variety,” refers to one’s material body, the bodies of others and the unlimited paraphernalia for bodily sense gratification, both physical and mental. By awakening to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one completely retires from illusory sense gratification and becomes absorbed in the progressive realization of the soul situated within the body. As revealed in the example of the two birds in a tree, both the individual soul and the Personality of Godhead are completely separate from the gross and subtle material bodies. If one turns one’s face to the Lord, recognizing one’s eternal dependence on Him, there will be no further suffering or anxiety, even though one is still situated within the material world. The unlimited experiences of material objects only increase one’s anxiety, whereas perception of the Absolute Truth, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, immediately brings one to the platform of peace. Thus one who is intelligent retires from the world of matter and becomes a fully self-realized Kṛṣṇa conscious person.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79480" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, this verse describes a type of discipline recommended for the <i>jñāna-yogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-โยคีสฺ,</span></i> who by intelligence try to understand that they are not their material bodies. One who is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, however, accepts and rejects material things in terms of their usefulness in the loving service of Lord Kṛṣṇa. One who is trying to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be seen as very intelligent and not <i>jaḍa-vat, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฑ-วตฺ,</span></i> or stunted, as described here. Although a devotee of the Lord does not act, speak or contemplate for his personal sense gratification, he remains very busy working, speaking and meditating in the devotional service of the Lord. The devotee makes elaborate plans to engage all the fallen souls in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s service so they can be purified and go back home, back to Godhead. Merely rejecting material things is not perfect consciousness. One must see everything as the property of the Lord and meant for the Lord’s pleasure. One busily engaged in spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has no time to make material distinctions and thus automatically comes to the liberated platform.</p></div>

If the pasture is not properly maintained, poisonous weeds will grow, or snakes will multiply, and there will be danger. Cows are infected by many types of diseases and bugs and must be regularly cleaned and disinfected. Similarly, fences must be maintained around the cow pasture, and there is even more work to be done. If the cow gives no milk, however, then one certainly performs hard labor with no tangible result. Laborious effort is also required to learn the Sanskrit language well enough to discern the subtle and esoteric meaning of the Vedic <i>mantras. - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> If after such great labor one does not understand the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which is the source of all happiness in life, and if one does not surrender to the Lord as the supreme shelter of all things, then one has certainly labored hard with no tangible result other than his own labor. Even a liberated soul who has given up the bodily concept of life will fall down if he does not take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In this verse, through various examples, it is concluded that the power of speech is useless if not engaged for the Supreme Lord. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, this verse implies that all of the functions of the various senses are useless if they are not engaged in the glorification of God. Indeed, the <i>avadhūta brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">อวธูต พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> previously stated to King Yadu that if the tongue is not controlled, one’s entire program of sense control is a failure. One cannot control the tongue unless he vibrates the glories of the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79492" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The example of the milkless cow is significant. A gentleman never kills a cow, and therefore when a cow becomes sterile and no longer gives milk, one must engage in the laborious task of protecting her, since no one will purchase a useless cow. For some time, the greedy owner of a sterile cow may continue thinking, “I have already invested so much money in taking care of this cow, and certainly in the near future she will again become pregnant and give milk.” But when this hope is proven futile, he becomes neglectful and indifferent to the health and safety of the animal. Because of such sinful neglect, he must suffer in the next life, after having already suffered because of the sterile cow in the present life.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79493" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Similarly, although a man may discover that his wife is neither chaste nor affectionate, he may be so eager to get children that he goes on taking care of such a useless wife, thinking, “I will teach my wife the religious duties of a chaste woman. By hearing historical examples of great women surely her heart will change, and she will become a wonderful wife to me.” Unfortunately, the unchaste wife in many cases does not change and also gives a man many useless children who are just as foolish and irreligious as she. Such children never give any happiness to the father, yet the father tediously labors to take care of them.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79494" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Also, one who has accumulated wealth by the mercy of God must be vigilant to give in charity to the right person and for the right cause. If such a right person or cause appears and one hesitates and selfishly does not give in charity, one loses his reputation, and in the next life he will be poverty-stricken. One who fails to give properly in charity spends his life anxiously protecting his wealth, which ultimately brings him no fame or happiness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79495" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The previous examples are given to illustrate the uselessness of laboriously studying Vedic knowledge that does not glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī comments that the spiritual vibration of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> is meant to bring one to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Many processes for achieving the Supreme Truth are recommended in the <i>Upaniṣads - <span style="color:#990012">อุปนิษทฺสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อุปนิษทฺสฺ</span></i> and other Vedic literatures, but because of their innumerable and seemingly contradictory explanations, commentaries and injunctions, one cannot achieve the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead, merely by reading such literature. If, however, one understands Śrī Kṛṣṇa to be the ultimate cause of all causes and reads the <i>Upaniṣads</i> and other Vedic literature as glorification of the Supreme Lord, then one can actually become fixed at the Lord’s lotus feet. For example, His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda translated and commented upon <i>Śrī Īśopaniṣad - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรี อีโศปนิษทฺ</span></i> in such a way that it brings the reader closer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Undoubtedly, the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa are the only reliable boat by which to cross the turbulent ocean of material existence. Even Lord Brahmā has stated in the Tenth Canto of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> that if one gives up the auspicious path of <i>bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> and takes to the fruitless labor of Vedic speculation, one is just like a fool who beats empty husks in hopes of getting rice. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī recommends that one completely ignore dry Vedic speculation because it does not bring one to the point of devotional service to the Absolute Truth, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>

After some time, the Lord’s pastimes are transferred to Mathurā and Dvārakā, and the extraordinary love of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana is exhibited in their anguished separation from Lord Kṛṣṇa.

One should know why the Personality of Godhead is all-pervading. The first verse of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> states, <i>janmādy asya yataḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ชนฺมาทฺยฺ อสฺย ยตฮ:</span></i> the Supreme Lord is the source of everything. And as stated in the previous verse of this chapter, He creates, maintains and annihilates everything. Thus the Lord is not all-pervading in the manner of air or sunlight; rather, the Lord is all-pervading as the absolute controller who holds in His hands the destiny of every living entity.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79511" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Everything is ultimately an expansion of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore there is really no other object of meditation besides Kṛṣṇa.

Because of ignorance, however, some of them go backward or stop along the way, foolishly thinking that their journey is finished, when in fact they are suspended in one of the minor potencies of the Supreme Lord. If one wants to intimately understand the nature of the Absolute Truth, one must take to the path of love of Godhead. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> (18.55):</p></div>

The word <i>bhramam</i> indicates a mistake; it can also mean “wandering” or “rotating.” The conditioned living entity, because of his mistake of falling into illusion, is wandering through a succession of material bodies, sometimes appearing as a demigod and sometimes as a worm in stool. The word <i>upārameta - <span style="color:#990012">อุปารเมต</span></i> means that one should stop such fruitless wandering and fix one’s mind on the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Lord, who is the true object of everyone’s love. Such a conclusion is not sentimental but is the result of keen analytic intelligence (<i>jijñāsayā - <span style="color:#990012">ชิชฺญาสยา</span></i>). Thus after elaborately explaining to Uddhava many aspects of analytic knowledge, the Lord now comes to the ultimate conclusion, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, pure love of Godhead.

        <div id="bb79524" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the Lord previously explained to Uddhava <i>jñāna-miśrā bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-มิศฺรา ภกฺติ,</span></i> or devotional service mixed with the impure desire to enjoy transcendental knowledge. In this verse the Lord clearly reveals that transcendental knowledge is an automatic by-product of loving service to the Lord, and in the next verse the Lord begins His explanation of pure devotional service, which is completely sufficient for self-realization. The desire to enjoy spiritual knowledge is certainly a material desire, since the goal is one’s personal satisfaction and not the pleasure of the Supreme Lord. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa here warns Uddhava that if one is not able to fix one’s mind in trance on the spiritual platform, then one should not go on simply theoretically discussing what is Brahman and what is not Brahman. Rather, one should engage in practical devotional service to the Supreme Lord, and then spiritual knowledge will automatically awaken in one’s heart. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (10.10):</p></div>
    
        <div id="bb79525" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ<br />bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam<br />dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ<br />yena mām upayānti te</i></em></div>

        <div id="bb79526" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79527" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Similarly, in the Tenth Canto of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> Lord Brahmā warns that one should not neglect the auspicious path of <i>bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> and instead take up the useless labor of mental speculation. By mere philosophical speculation one cannot fix one’s mind on the spiritual platform. Many great philosophers throughout history had abominable personal habits, which proves that they could not fix themselves on the spiritual platform by mere speculation on philosophical categories. If one is not fortunate enough to have executed devotional service to the Lord in one’s past life, and if one is therefore addicted to mere speculation on the differences between matter and spirit, one will not be able to fix one’s mind on the spiritual platform. Such a person should give up useless speculation and engage in the practical work of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, absorbing himself twenty-four hours a day in the mission of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In such missionary work for the Lord’s sake, one should never try to enjoy the fruits of one’s work. Even though the mind is not completely pure, if one offers the fruits of one’s work to the Lord, the mind will quickly come to the standard of pure desirelessness, in which one’s only desire is the Lord’s satisfaction.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79528" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī states that if one does not have faith in the personal form and activities of the Personality of Godhead, one will not have the spiritual strength to remain perpetually on the transcendental platform. In this verse the Lord is definitely bringing Uddhava, and all living entities, to the conclusion of all philosophy — pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79529" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura points out that one who is bewildered by false ego may not want to offer his activities to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though this is the actual way of rising above the influence of the modes of material nature. Because of ignorance one does not know that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa and instead is attracted by the duality of material illusion. One cannot become free from such illusion by theoretical speculation, but if one offers one’s work to the Personality of Godhead, one will clearly understand his eternal, transcendental position as a servant of the Lord.</p></div>

There are many authorized songs and prayers glorifying these pastimes of the Lord, and by constantly chanting them one will automatically be fixed in <i>smaraṇam, - <span style="color:#990012">สฺมรณมฺ,</span></i> or remembrance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord exhibited His opulences upon His birth in Kaṁsa’s prison and at the birth ceremony subsequently performed by Nanda Mahārāja in Gokula. The Lord further performed many adventurous activities, such as chastising the serpent Kāliya and killing many other demons. One should regularly take part in the ceremonies commemorating Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes, such as the Janmāṣṭamī celebration glorifying the Lord’s birth. On such days one should worship the Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master and thus remember the Lord’s pastimes.</p></div>

The word <i>kāma - <span style="color:#990012">กาม</span></i> indicates that one should satisfy one’s desires with the transcendental paraphernalia of the Lord. One should eat <i>mahā-prasādam, - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ปฺรสาทมฺ,</span></i> food offered to the Deity of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and one should also decorate oneself with the Lord’s flower garlands and sandalwood pulp and should place the remnants of the Deity’s clothing on one’s body. One who lives in a luxurious mansion or apartment should convert his residence into a temple of Lord Kṛṣṇa and invite others to come, chant before the Deity, hear <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> and <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> and taste the remnants of the Lord’s food, or one may live in a beautiful temple building in the community of Vaiṣṇavas and engage in the same activities. The word <i>artha - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺตฺห</span></i> in this verse indicates that one who is inclined toward business should accumulate money to promote the missionary work of the Lord’s devotees and not for one’s personal sense gratification. Thus one’s business activities are also considered to be devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. The word <i>niścalām - <span style="color:#990012">นิศฺจลามฺ</span></i> indicates that since Lord Kṛṣṇa is eternally fixed in perfect knowledge and bliss, there is no possibility of disturbance for one who worships the Lord. If we worship anything except the Lord, our worship may be disturbed when our worshipable deity is placed in an awkward position. But because the Lord is supreme, our worship of Him is eternally free of disturbance.</p></div>

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī mentions in this connection that one who is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness may specifically be attracted to the pastimes of a devotee in the spiritual world who serves the Lord in a particular way. An advanced devotee in this world may desire to serve the Lord in the same way and thus may take pleasure in dramatically reliving the service of his worshipable devotee-master in the spiritual world. Also, one may take pleasure in spiritual festivals, performances of particular pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or activities of other devotees of the Lord. In this way, one can continually increase one’s faith in the Personality of Godhead. Those who have no desire to hear, glorify or remember the transcendental activities of the Lord are certainly materially polluted and never achieve the highest perfection. Such persons spoil the opportunity of human life by devoting themselves to fleeting mundane topics that produce no eternal benefit. The real meaning of religion is to constantly serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose form is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. One who has taken full shelter of the Lord is completely uninterested in impersonal speculations about the nature of God and uses his time to advance more and more in the unlimited bliss of pure devotional service.</p></div>

One may ask how such surrender or devotion is actually achieved. The Lord gives the answer in this verse. One must live in a society of devotees, and thus automatically one will be engaged twenty-four hours a day in the various processes of devotional service, beginning with <i>śravaṇam, kīrtanam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณมฺ, กีรฺตนมฺ</span></i> and <i>smaraṇam - <span style="color:#990012">สฺมรณมฺ</span></i> (hearing, glorifying and remembering the Lord). The pure devotees of the Lord can reveal the spiritual world by their transcendental sound vibration, making it possible for even a neophyte devotee to experience the Lord’s abode. Being thus enlivened, the neophyte makes further progress and gradually becomes qualified to personally serve the Personality of Godhead in the spiritual world. By constantly associating with devotees and learning from them about devotional science, one quickly achieves a deep attachment for the Lord and the Lord’s service, and such attachment gradually matures into pure love of Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79544" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Foolish persons say that the various <i>mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺร</span>s - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> composed of names of God, as well as all other <i>mantras, - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ,</span></i> are merely material creations with no special value, and therefore any so-called <i>mantra</i> or mystical process will ultimately produce the same result. To refute such superficial thinking, the Lord here describes the science of going back home, back to Godhead. One should not accept the bad association of impersonalists, who state that the holy name, form, qualities and pastimes of the Lord are <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> or illusion. <i>Māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i> is actually an insignificant potency of the almighty Personality of Godhead, and if one ignorantly tries to elevate illusion above the Absolute Truth, one will never experience love of Godhead and will be cast into deep forgetfulness of the Lord. One should not associate with those who are envious of the fortunate devotees who are going back to Godhead. Such envious persons deride the abode of the Lord, which is revealed by the pure devotees to those who have faith in the Lord’s message. Envious persons create disturbances among the people in general, who should take shelter of the faithful devotees of the Lord. Unless people hear from pure devotees, it is impossible for them to understand that there is a Supreme Personality of Godhead eternally existing in His own abode, which is self-luminous, full of bliss and knowledge. In this verse, the importance of <i>saṅga, - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺค,</span></i> association, is clearly explained.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79550" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous verse it was stated that one can achieve the Lord’s supreme abode by associating with devotees. Therefore, Uddhava naturally inquires about the symptoms of a distinguished devotee whose association can promote one to the kingdom of God. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī notes that the Personality of Godhead knows who is actually a sincere devotee because the Lord is always attached to His loving servitors. Similarly, pure devotees can expertly explain the proper methods of devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa because they are already absorbed in love of Kṛṣṇa. Uddhava herein requests Lord Kṛṣṇa to describe the qualities of a devotee and asks the Lord to explain the devotional service that the devotees themselves approve as worthy to be offered to the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79551" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura remarks that the word <i>puruṣādhyakṣa - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษาธฺยกฺษ</span></i> indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme ruler of the universal controllers headed by Mahā-Viṣṇu, and thus the Lord possesses infinite sovereignty. The term <i>lokādhyakṣa - <span style="color:#990012">โลกาธฺยกฺษ</span></i> indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate supervising authority of all of the Vaikuṇṭha planets, and therefore the Lord is unlimitedly glorious and perfect. Uddhava further addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as <i>jagat-prabhu, - <span style="color:#990012">ชคตฺ-ปฺรภุ,</span></i> because even in the illusory material world the Lord exhibits His unlimited mercy by personally incarnating to uplift the conditioned souls. The word <i>praṇatāya - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรณตาย</span></i> (“Your surrendered devotee”) indicates that Uddhava is not proud like ordinary fools who do not enjoy bowing down to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Uddhava mentions that he is <i>anuraktāya, - <span style="color:#990012">อนุรกฺตาย,</span></i> or completely bound in love to Lord Kṛṣṇa, because unlike other great devotees such as Arjuna, who sometimes worshiped demigods in order to comply with social customs or to show respect for their positions in the scheme of planetary management, Uddhava never worshiped any demigods. Therefore, Uddhava is <i>prapannāya, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรปนฺนาย,</span></i> or completely surrendered to Lord Kṛṣṇa, having no other shelter.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79557" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord is like the sky (<i>vyoma - <span style="color:#990012">โวฺยม</span></i>) because although expanded everywhere, He is not entangled in anything. He is <i>prakṛteḥ paraḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤเตฮ ปรฮ,</span></i> or completely transcendental to material nature. The Lord is fully self-satisfied and is therefore indifferent to the affairs of the material world. Still, because of His causeless mercy, the Lord desires to expand pure devotional service, and for this reason He incarnates within the material world to uplift the fallen conditioned souls.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79558" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord descends in selected spiritual bodies to please His loving devotees. Sometimes He appears in His original form as Kṛṣṇa. And even Kṛṣṇa Himself appears in different forms to special devotees so that they may fully develop their loving sentiments for Him. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī gives several examples of the Lord’s special mercy upon His devotees. Lord Kṛṣṇa personally went to the home of Jāmbavān and there displayed a form with slightly angry glances. In that form, the Lord enjoyed a fight with His devotee. The Lord displayed His form as Dattātreya to Atri Muni and similarly bestowed special mercy upon Lord Brahmā, the demigods, Akrūra and innumerable other devotees. And in Vṛndāvana the Lord displayed His most beautiful form as Govinda to the fortunate inhabitants.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79559" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Madhvācārya has quoted from the <i>Prakāśa-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกาศ-สํหิตา</span></i> as follows. “The Lord accepts different spiritual bodies according to the desire of His devotees. For example, the Lord agreed to become the son of Vasudeva and Devakī. Thus, although Lord Kṛṣṇa has an eternal, blissful spiritual form, He appears to enter within the body of His devotee who becomes His mother. Although we speak of the Lord’s ‘taking on a body,’ the Lord does not change His form, as do the conditioned souls, who must change their material bodies. The Lord appears in His own eternally unchangeable forms. Lord Hari always appears in the forms that are especially desired by His loving devotees, and never in other forms. However, if one thinks that the Lord, in the manner of an ordinary person taking birth, becomes the physical son of Vasudeva or other devotees, then one is victimized by illusion. The Lord merely expands His spiritual potency, causing His pure devotees to think, ‘Kṛṣṇa is now my son.’ One should understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead never accepts or rejects a material body, nor does He ever give up His eternal spiritual forms; rather, the Lord eternally manifests His blissful bodies according to the loving sentiments of His eternal pure devotees.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79560" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī mentions that the word <i>vyoma - <span style="color:#990012">โวฺยม</span></i> also indicates the Lord’s name of Paravyoma, or the Lord of the spiritual sky. One should not misinterpret this verse to mean that Lord Kṛṣṇa is impersonal, like the material sky, or that the form of Kṛṣṇa is merely another selected incarnation equal to any other. Such casual and whimsical speculations cannot be accepted as actual spiritual knowledge. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead (<i>kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณสฺ ตุ ภควานฺ สฺวยมฺ</span></i>), and the Lord has explained elaborately in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that He is the original source of everything. Therefore, the pure devotees of the Lord are eternally engaged, in full knowledge and bliss, in loving service to the Lord’s original form as Kṛṣṇa. The whole purpose of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> is to arouse our love for Lord Kṛṣṇa, and one should not foolishly misunderstand this great purpose.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79567" class="r r-lang-en r-translation" ><p><strong>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O Uddhava, a saintly person is merciful and never injures others. Even if others are aggressive he is tolerant and forgiving toward all living entities. His strength and meaning in life come from the truth itself, he is free from all envy and jealousy, and his mind is equal in material happiness and distress. Thus, he dedicates his time to work for the welfare of all others. His intelligence is never bewildered by material desires, and he has controlled his senses. His behavior is always pleasing, never harsh and always exemplary, and he is free from possessiveness. He never endeavors in ordinary, worldly activities, and he strictly controls his eating. He therefore always remains peaceful and steady. A saintly person is thoughtful and accepts Me as his only shelter. Such a person is very cautious in the execution of his duties and is never subject to superficial transformations, because he is steady and noble, even in a distressing situation. He has conquered over the six material qualities — namely hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death. He is free from all desire for prestige and offers honor to others. He is expert in reviving the Kṛṣṇa consciousness of others and therefore never cheats anyone. Rather, he is a well-wishing friend to all, being most merciful. Such a saintly person must be considered the most learned of men. He perfectly understands that the ordinary religious duties prescribed by Me in various Vedic scriptures possess favorable qualities that purify the performer, and he knows that neglect of such duties constitutes a discrepancy in one’s life. Having taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a saintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus considered to be the best among all living entities.</strong></p></div>

        <div id="bb79568" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Verses 29-31 describe twenty-eight qualities of a saintly person, and verse 32 explains the highest perfection of life. According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, the seventeenth quality (<i>mat-śaraṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">มตฺ-ศรณ,</span></i> or taking complete shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa) is the most important, and the other twenty-seven qualities automatically appear in one who has become a pure devotee of the Lord. As stated in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (5.18.12), <i>yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ยสฺยาสฺติ ภกฺติรฺ ภควตฺยฺ อกิญฺจนา สไรฺวรฺ คุไณสฺ ตตฺร สมาสเต สุราฮ.</span></i> The twenty-eight saintly qualities may be described as follows.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79569" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(1) <i>Kṛpālu. - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤปาลุ.</span></i> A devotee cannot tolerate seeing the world merged in ignorance and suffering the whiplashes of <i>māyā. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i> Therefore he busily engages in distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is called <i>kṛpālu, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤปาลุ,</span></i> or merciful.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79570" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(2) <i>Akṛta-droha. - <span style="color:#990012">อกฺฤตโ-ทฺรห.</span></i> Even if someone is offensive toward a devotee, a devotee does not become offensive in return. Indeed, he never acts against the interest of any living entity. One may argue that great Vaiṣṇava kings, such as Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and Parīkṣit Mahārāja, executed many criminals. However, when justice is properly administered by the state, sinful, destructive persons actually benefit from their punishment because they become freed from the severe karmic reactions to their illicit activities. A Vaiṣṇava ruler gives punishment not out of envy or malice, but in faithful obedience to the laws of God. The Māyāvādī philosophers who want to kill God by imagining that He does not exist are certainly <i>kṛta-droha, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤตโ-ทฺรห,</span></i> or most injurious to themselves and others. The impersonalist imagines that he himself is supreme and thus creates a most dangerous situation for himself and his followers. Similarly, the <i>karmīs, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ,</span></i> who are dedicated to material sense gratification, are also killers of the self, because by their absorption in material consciousness they lose all chance of experiencing the Absolute Truth and the truth of their own self. Therefore, all living entities who come under the control of materialistic regulations and duties are unnecessarily harassing themselves and others, and a pure Vaiṣṇava feels great compassion and concern for them. A devotee never uses his mind, body or words to perform any act harmful to the welfare of any living entity.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79571" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(3) <i>Titikṣu. - <span style="color:#990012">ติติกฺษุ.</span></i> A devotee forgives and forgets any offense against himself. A Vaiṣṇava is personally detached from his material body, which is made of pus, stool, blood, and so on. Therefore the devotee is able to overlook the obnoxious behavior he sometimes meets with in the course of preaching work and always deals with people as a perfect gentleman. A Vaiṣṇava loudly chants the holy name of the Lord and tolerates and forgives those fallen conditioned souls who are unable to reciprocate properly with a pure devotee.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79572" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(4) <i>Satya-sāra. - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺย-สาร.</span></i> A devotee always remembers that he is the eternal servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is omniscient, the reservoir of all pleasure and the ultimate enjoyer of all activities. By avoiding activities outside devotional service, a devotee remains fixed in the truth, does not uselessly waste time and thus becomes bold, powerful and steady.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79573" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(5) <i>Anavadyātmā. - <span style="color:#990012">อนวทฺยาตฺมา.</span></i> A devotee knows that the material world is a temporary phantasmagoria and therefore does not envy anyone in any material situation. He never tries to agitate others or criticize them unnecessarily.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79574" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(6) <i>Sama. - <span style="color:#990012">สม.</span></i> A devotee remains steady and equal in material happiness or distress, fame or infamy. His actual wealth is his consciousness of Kṛṣṇa, and he understands that his real self-interest lies outside the scope of material nature. He does not become excited or depressed by external events, but remains fixed in consciousness of the omnipotency of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79575" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(7) <i>Sarvopakāraka. - <span style="color:#990012">สโรฺวปการก.</span></i> Neglecting one’s selfish desires and working for the satisfaction of others is called <i>paropakāra, - <span style="color:#990012">ปโรปการ,</span></i> whereas causing trouble to others for one’s personal gratification is called <i>parāpakāra. - <span style="color:#990012">ปราปการ.</span></i> A devotee always works for the pleasure of Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is the resting place of all living entities, and thus a devotee’s activities are ultimately pleasing to everyone. Devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa is the perfectional stage of welfare work, since Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller of everyone’s happiness and distress. Foolish persons under the influence of false egotism, considering themselves to be the ultimate well-wishers of others, execute superficial materialistic activities rather than attending to the eternal happiness of others. Because a devotee remains pure and engages in missionary activities, he is everyone’s best friend.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79576" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(8) <i>Kāmair ahata-dhī. - <span style="color:#990012">กาไมรฺ อหต-ธี.</span></i> Ordinary persons see all material things as objects for their personal gratification and thus try to acquire or control them. Ultimately a man wants to possess a woman and enjoy sex gratification with her. The Supreme Lord supplies the desired fuel that causes the fire of lust to burn painfully in one’s heart, but the Lord does not give self-realization to such a misguided person. Lord Kṛṣṇa is transcendental and neutral, but if one is eager to exploit the Lord’s creation, the Lord gives one facility through <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> and one becomes cheated of real happiness by entangling himself in the false role of a great and lusty enjoyer of the world. On the other hand, one who has taken full shelter of Kṛṣṇa is enriched with perfect knowledge and bliss and is not cheated by the seductive appearances of the material world. A pure devotee does not follow the path of the foolish deer, which is seduced by the hunter’s horn and killed. A devotee is never attracted by the sensuous entreaties of a beautiful woman, and he avoids hearing from bewildered <i>karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> about the so-called glories of material acquisition. Similarly, a pure devotee is not bewildered by aroma or taste. He does not become attached to sumptuous eating, nor does he spend the whole day making arrangements for bodily comfort. The only actual enjoyer of God’s creation is the Lord Himself, and the living entities are secondary enjoyers who experience unlimited pleasure through the Lord’s pleasure. This perfect process of experiencing pleasure is called <i>bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> or pure devotional service, and a devotee never sacrifices his auspicious position of steady intelligence, even in the face of so-called material opportunity.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79577" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(9) <i>Dānta. - <span style="color:#990012">ทานฺต.</span></i> A devotee is naturally repelled by sinful activities and controls his senses by dedicating all his acts to Kṛṣṇa. This requires steady concentration and a cautious mentality.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79578" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(10) <i>Mṛdu. - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤทุ.</span></i> A materialistic person will always see people as friends or enemies and thus will sometimes justify cruel or small-minded behavior in order to subdue his opponents. Since a devotee has taken shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he does not consider anyone his enemy and is never disturbed by the tendency to desire or enjoy the suffering of others. Thus he is <i>mṛdu, - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤทุ,</span></i> or gentle and sublime.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79579" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(11) <i>Śuci. - <span style="color:#990012">ศุจิ.</span></i> A devotee never touches that which is impure or improper, and simply by remembering such a pure devotee, one is freed from the tendency to sin. Because of his perfect behavior, a devotee is called <i>śuci, - <span style="color:#990012">ศุจิ,</span></i> or pure.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79580" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(12) <i>Akiñcana. - <span style="color:#990012">อกิญฺจน.</span></i> A devotee is free from possessiveness and is not eager to enjoy or renounce anything, since he considers everything to be Lord Kṛṣṇa’s property.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79581" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(13) <i>Anīha. - <span style="color:#990012">อนีห.</span></i> A devotee never acts on his own behalf, but rather for the service of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He is therefore aloof from ordinary, worldly affairs.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79582" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(14) <i>Mita-bhuk. - <span style="color:#990012">มิต-ภุกฺ.</span></i> A devotee accepts material sense objects only as far as necessary, to keep himself healthy and fit in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s service. He is therefore not entangled by his sense activities and never injures his self-realization. When necessary, a devotee can give up anything for Lord Kṛṣṇa’s service, but he does not accept or reject anything for his personal prestige.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79583" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(15) <i>Śānta. - <span style="color:#990012">ศานฺต.</span></i> Those trying to exploit the Lord’s creation are always disturbed. A devotee, however, is detached from such pointless activities and understands sense gratification to be diametrically opposed to his self-interest. Being always engaged according to the Lord’s desire, he remains peaceful.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79584" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(16) <i>Sthira. - <span style="color:#990012">สฺตฺหิร.</span></i> Remembering that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the basis of everything, a devotee does not become fearful or impatient.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79585" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(17) <i>Mat-śaraṇa. - <span style="color:#990012">มตฺ-ศรณ.</span></i> A devotee does not take pleasure in anything except serving Lord Kṛṣṇa and is constantly attentive in the execution of his duties. A devotee knows that only Lord Kṛṣṇa can protect him and engage him in useful work.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79586" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(18) <i>Muni. - <span style="color:#990012">มุนิ.</span></i> A devotee is thoughtful and through intelligent contemplation avoids becoming distracted from his spiritual advancement. By intelligence he is freed from doubts about Lord Kṛṣṇa and confronts all problems in life with steady Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79587" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(19) <i>Apramatta. - <span style="color:#990012">อปฺรมตฺต.</span></i> One who forgets the Supreme Lord is more or less crazy, but a devotee remains sane by offering his activities to Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79588" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(20) <i>Gabhīrātmā. - <span style="color:#990012">คภีราตฺมา.</span></i> As a devotee merges into the ocean of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his own consciousness becomes deeper and deeper; ordinary, superficial persons hovering on the material platform cannot fathom the extent of a devotee’s awareness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79589" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(21) <i>Dhṛtimān. - <span style="color:#990012">ธฺฤติมานฺ.</span></i> By controlling the urges of the tongue and genitals the devotee remains steady and patient and does not impulsively change his position.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79590" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(22) <i>Jita-ṣaḍ-guṇa. - <span style="color:#990012">ชิต-ษฑฺ-คุณ.</span></i> By spiritual knowledge, a devotee is able to conquer the pushings of hunger, thirst, lamentation, illusion, old age and death.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79591" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(23) <i>Amānī. - <span style="color:#990012">อมานี.</span></i> A devotee is not puffed up, and even if he is famous, he does not take such fame very seriously.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79592" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(24) <i>Māna-da. - <span style="color:#990012">มาน-ท.</span></i> A devotee offers all respects to others, since everyone is part and parcel of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79593" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(25) <i>Kalya. - <span style="color:#990012">กลฺย.</span></i> A devotee is expert in making people understand the truth of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79594" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(26) <i>Maitra. - <span style="color:#990012">ไมตฺร.</span></i> A devotee does not cheat anyone by encouraging them in the bodily concept of life; rather, by his missionary work a devotee is the true friend of everyone.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79595" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(27) <i>Kāruṇika. - <span style="color:#990012">การุณิก.</span></i> A devotee tries to make people sane and thus is most merciful. He is <i>para-duḥkha-duḥkhī, - <span style="color:#990012">ปร-ทุฮข-ทุฮขี,</span></i> or one who is unhappy to see the unhappiness of others.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79596" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>(28) <i>Kavi. - <span style="color:#990012">กวิ.</span></i> A devotee is expert in studying the transcendental qualities of Lord Kṛṣṇa and is able to show the harmony and compatibility of the Lord’s apparently contradictory qualities. This is possible through expert knowledge of the absolute nature of the Lord. Lord Caitanya is softer than a rose and harder than a thunderbolt, but these opposing qualities can easily be understood in terms of the Lord’s transcendental nature and purpose. One who is always able to understand the truth of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without opposition or confusion, is called <i>kavi, - <span style="color:#990012">กวิ,</span></i> or most learned.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79597" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The position of those on the spiritual path can be understood in terms of their development of the qualities mentioned above. Ultimately, the most important quality is to take shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa, since the Lord can award all good qualities to His sincere devotee. In the lowest stage of devotional service one acts with a desire to enjoy sense gratification but at the same time tries to offer the fruits to the Lord. This stage is called <i>karma-miśrā bhakti. - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-มิศฺรา ภกฺติ.</span></i> As one gradually purifies himself in devotional service, he becomes detached through knowledge and gains relief from anxiety. In this stage he becomes attached to transcendental knowledge, and therefore this stage is called <i>jñāna-miśrā bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-มิศฺรา ภกฺติ,</span></i> or devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa with a desire to enjoy the fruits of transcendental knowledge. But because pure love for Kṛṣṇa is actually the greatest happiness and the natural position of the living entity, a sincere devotee gradually overcomes his desire to enjoy sense gratification and knowledge and comes to the stage of pure devotional service, which is devoid of personal desire. <i>Na karmāṇi tyajed yogī - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี</span> karmabhis tyajyate hi saḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">น กรฺมาณิ ตฺยเชทฺ โยคี กรฺมภิสฺ ตฺยชฺยเต หิ สฮ:</span></i> “The <i>yogī</i> should not give up his work, but rather should cultivate detachment by which his material activities will automatically vanish.” In other words, one should continue to perform one’s prescribed duties, even imperfectly. If one is sincere about advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then by the strength of <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> his activities will gradually be transformed into pure loving service.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79598" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are innumerable examples of fruitive workers, mental speculators and materialistic devotees who became perfect by the strength of devotional service. By rendering loving service to Kṛṣṇa, one automatically experiences the greatest pleasure of life and is endowed with perfect knowledge. There is nothing lacking in the process of pure devotional service, and there is no need for any extraneous endeavor to acquire sense pleasure or philosophical satisfaction. One must be completely convinced that simply by serving Kṛṣṇa one will get all perfection in life. Even if one lacks some or all of the above-mentioned qualities, one should sincerely engage in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s service, and gradually one’s character will become perfect. One who is a sincere devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa will develop all godly qualities by the mercy of the Lord, and one who is already serving the Lord with the above-mentioned qualities is to be understood as the greatest devotee. As indicated in verse 32, a pure devotee of the Lord is fully aware of the pious advantages of executing duties within the <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span></i> system, and he is similarly aware of the harmful mistake of neglecting such duties. Still, having full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, a devotee gives up all ordinary social and religious activities and engages fully in devotional service. He knows that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate source of everything and that all perfection comes from Lord Kṛṣṇa alone. Because of his extraordinary faith, the devotee is called <i>sattama, - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺตม,</span></i> or the best among all living beings.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79599" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As explained by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in <i>Upadeśāmṛta, - <span style="color:#990012">อุปเทศามฺฤต,</span></i> a devotee who has not yet developed the good qualities mentioned above but is nevertheless sincerely endeavoring for Kṛṣṇa consciousness should receive the mercy of superior Vaiṣṇavas. One should not necessarily accept intimate association with such an aspirant to pure devotional service, but one should be confident that by chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa such a person will eventually attain all perfection. One can imagine the beauty of a society filled with saintly persons, as described in these verses. The wonderful Kṛṣṇa conscious qualities mentioned above are the basis of a peaceful and prosperous society, and if everyone takes to the loving service of Lord Kṛṣṇa, then certainly the present atmosphere of fear, violence, lust, greed and insanity can be replaced by a celestial situation in which all leaders and citizens will be happy. The essential points here are <i>mat-śaraṇa - <span style="color:#990012">มตฺ-ศรณ</span></i> (“one should take full shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa”) and <i>māṁ bhajeta - <span style="color:#990012">มาํ ภเชต</span></i> (“one should worship the Lord through the authorized process”). In this way the entire world can become <i>sattama, - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺตม,</span></i> or most perfect.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79604" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, although <i>yāvān - <span style="color:#990012">ยาวานฺ</span></i> indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot be limited by time or space, He becomes limited by the love of His pure devotees. For example, Lord Kṛṣṇa never steps one foot out of Vṛndāvana, because of the intense love of its inhabitants for Him. In this way, the Lord comes under the control of His devotees’ love. The word <i>yaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ยฮ</span></i> indicates that Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth who appears as the son of Vasudeva, or as Śyāmasundara. <i>Yādṛśa - <span style="color:#990012">ยาทฺฤศ</span></i> indicates that the Lord is <i>ātmārāma, - <span style="color:#990012">อาตฺมาราม,</span></i> or completely self-satisfied, and also <i>āpta-kāma, - <span style="color:#990012">อาปฺต-กาม,</span></i> or “one who automatically fulfills all of His desires.” Still, being affected by the love of His devotees, the Lord sometimes appears to be <i>anātmārāma, - <span style="color:#990012">อนาตฺมาราม,</span></i> or dependent on the love of His devotees, and <i>anāptakāma, - <span style="color:#990012">อนาปฺตกาม,</span></i> unable to achieve His desire without the cooperation of His devotees. Actually, the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, is always independent, but He reciprocates the intense love of His devotees and thus appears to be dependent on them, just as He apparently became dependent on Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā during His childhood pastimes in Vṛndāvana. The word <i>ajñātvā - <span style="color:#990012">อชฺญาตฺวา</span></i> (“inexperienced, lacking knowledge”) indicates that sometimes a devotee may not have a proper philosophical understanding of the Personality of Godhead or due to love may temporarily forget the Lord’s position. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (11.41) Arjuna says:</p></div>

        <div id="bb79606" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“I have in the past addressed You as ‘O Kṛṣṇa,’ ‘O Yādava,’ ‘O my friend,’ without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever I may have done in madness or in love.” Arjuna’s words <i>ajānatā mahimānam - <span style="color:#990012">อชานตา มหิมานมฺ</span></i> have the same meaning as Kṛṣṇa’s words <i>ajñātvā mām - <span style="color:#990012">อชฺญาตฺวา มามฺ</span></i> in this verse of the <i>Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> Both indicate incomplete understanding of Kṛṣṇa’s glories. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> Arjuna says, <i>praṇayena: - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรณเยน:</span></i> his forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa’s supreme position was caused by his love for Him. In this verse, Kṛṣṇa excuses such lapses on the part of His devotees with the words <i>ajñātvā mām, - <span style="color:#990012">อชฺญาตฺวา มามฺ,</span></i> which indicate that even though devotees may not fully appreciate His exalted position, Kṛṣṇa accepts their loving service. Thus this verse clearly reveals the supreme position of <i>bhakti. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ.</span></i> Lord Kṛṣṇa also states in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> (11.54):</p></div>

        <div id="bb79609" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Although one may develop innumerable saintly qualities, without love of Kṛṣṇa one will not achieve complete success. One must understand the Personality of Godhead as He is and love Him. Even if one is not capable of analytically understanding the position of God, if one simply loves Kṛṣṇa, then one is certainly perfect. Many of the residents of Vṛndāvana had no idea that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, nor did they know of Kṛṣṇa’s potencies or incarnations. They simply loved Kṛṣṇa with their hearts and souls, and therefore they are considered most perfect.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79620" class="r r-lang-en r-translation" ><p><strong>My dear Uddhava, one can give up false pride and prestige by engaging in the following devotional activities. One may purify oneself by seeing, touching, worshiping, serving, and offering prayers of glorification and obeisances to My form as the Deity and to My pure devotees. One should also glorify My transcendental qualities and activities, hear with love and faith the narrations of My glories and constantly meditate on Me. One should offer to Me whatever one acquires, and accepting oneself as My eternal servant, one should give oneself completely to Me. One should always discuss My birth and activities and enjoy life by participating in festivals, such as Janmāṣṭamī, which glorify My pastimes. In My temple, one should also participate in festivals and ceremonies by singing, dancing, playing musical instruments and discussing Me with other Vaiṣṇavas. One should observe all the regularly celebrated annual festivals by attending ceremonies, pilgrimages and making offerings. One should also observe religious vows such as Ekādaśī and take initiation by the procedures mentioned in the Vedas, Pañcarātra and other, similar literatures. One should faithfully and lovingly support the installation of My Deity, and individually or in cooperation with others one should work for the construction of Kṛṣṇa conscious temples and cities as well as flower gardens, fruit gardens and special areas to celebrate My pastimes. One should consider oneself to be My humble servant, without duplicity, and thus should help to clean the temple, which is My home. First one should sweep and dust thoroughly, and then one should further cleanse with water and cow dung. Having dried the temple, one should sprinkle scented water and decorate the temple with maṇḍalas. One should thus act just like My servant. A devotee should never advertise his devotional activities; therefore his service will not be the cause of false pride. One should never use lamps that are offered to Me for other purposes simply because there is need of illumination, and similarly, one should never offer to Me anything that has been offered to or used by others. Whatever is most desired by one within this material world, and whatever is most dear to oneself — one should offer that very thing to Me. Such an offering qualifies one for eternal life.</strong></p></div>

        <div id="bb79621" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In these eight verses Lord Kṛṣṇa ends His discussion of saintly qualities in general and describes the specific characteristics of the devotees of the Lord. Lord Kṛṣṇa has clearly described both here and in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that the ultimate goal of life is to surrender fully to Him and become His pure devotee. Herein the Lord elaborately describes the process of devotional service. One should offer everything that one acquires to the Lord, thinking, “Lord Kṛṣṇa has sent these things so that I may serve Him nicely.” One ultimately should understand that the minute spirit soul is part and parcel of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and thus one should surrender one’s very self to the Lord. Just as an ordinary servant is meek and submissive to his master, similarly, a devotee should always be submissive to his spiritual master, who is a representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He should realize how his body and mind are purified simply by his seeing the spiritual master or by accepting on his head the water offered to the spiritual master. It is emphasized in these verses that one should attend Vaiṣṇava festivals. As far as possible, large festivals should be held all over the world so that people can gradually learn how to perfect human life. The words <i>mamārcā-sthāpane śraddhā - <span style="color:#990012">มมารฺจา-สฺตฺหาปเน ศฺรทฺธา</span></i> are significant. Here Lord Kṛṣṇa states that one should have faith in His Deity worship, since the Lord is personally present as the Deity. The words <i>udyānopavanākrīḍa-pura-mandira-karmaṇi - <span style="color:#990012">อุทฺยาโนปวนากฺรีฑ-ปุร-มนฺทิร-กรฺมณิ</span></i> indicate that there should be a serious endeavor to construct beautiful temples and Vaiṣṇava cities with ample parks, orchards and flower gardens. An outstanding example of such endeavors can be presently seen in India at the Māyāpur Candrodaya Mandira.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79622" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The words <i>dīpāvalokaṁ me nopayuñjyān niveditam - <span style="color:#990012">ทีปาวโลกํ เม โนปยุญฺชฺยานฺ นิเวทิตมฺ</span></i> indicate that one may never use the Deity’s paraphernalia for sense gratification. If there is a shortage of electricity or lights, one may not use the Deity’s lamps, nor should one ever offer to Lord Kṛṣṇa paraphernalia previously offered to or used by others. In these verses, the importance of Deity worship and Vaiṣṇava festivals is emphasized in many ways. Lord Kṛṣṇa promises that whoever sincerely performs these activities will certainly go back home, back to Godhead (<i>tad ānantyāya kalpate - <span style="color:#990012">ตทฺ อานนฺตฺยาย กลฺปเต</span></i>). One should offer his most dear possession to Lord Kṛṣṇa, not that which is superfluous or unwanted. If one is most attached to his family, one should see that his family is engaged in Lord Kṛṣṇa’s service. If one is most attached to money, that should be given for propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And if one considers one’s intelligence to be most valuable, he should preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness with great logic and reason. If we offer our most valuable possessions to Lord Kṛṣṇa, we will automatically become dear to the Lord and go back to Godhead.</p></div>

It is clearly stated in all Vedic literatures that the Supreme Absolute Truth is the source of everything. Everything is within Him, and He is within everything. To avoid a materialistic conception of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one should not think that the Lord exists only in a particular time and place. Rather, one should understand that He exists at all times and in all places and that one may search for and find Lord Kṛṣṇa within all things.

        <div id="bb79639" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord has previously explained that He appears in different transcendental forms to His pure devotees so that they may unlimitedly increase their love of Godhead. Here is given a general description of the four-armed Nārāyaṇa form, which pervades the material world as Supersoul, or Paramātmā. The pure devotees, however, do not meditate upon the Lord within the heart but rather render active service to a specific form of the Lord, such as Rāma or Kṛṣṇa, and thus perfect their realization of Bhagavān, or the Supreme Lord, who engages in transcendental pastimes with His devotees in the spiritual world. Yet even within the material world one can spiritualize one’s existence by seeing the Supreme Lord within everything and worshiping Him by constant meditation. As mentioned in the previous verses, one should also go to the temple and specifically worship the Deity and participate in spiritual festivals. One should not be puffed up and claim that because one is meditating on the Lord within nature there is no need to go to the temple. Temple worship has been repeatedly emphasized by the Lord Himself. The word <i>samāhita - <span style="color:#990012">สมาหิต</span></i> in this verse indicates <i>samādhi. - <span style="color:#990012">สมาธิ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สมาธิ.</span></i> If one very carefully worships the Deity or hears and chants about the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one is certainly in <i>samādhi.</i> By worshiping and glorifying the Lord twenty-four hours a day one becomes a liberated soul and gradually rises completely beyond the influence of the material creation. The living entity is called <i>ātmā, - <span style="color:#990012">อาตฺมา,</span></i> or eternal soul, because of his relationship with the Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. By worshiping the Lord, our eternal nature revives, and as we increase our enthusiasm and steadiness in devotional service, material existence fades away.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79649" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Kṛṣṇa has described to Uddhava the characteristics of <i>jñāna-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-โยค</span></i> and <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> both of which are considered to be spiritual processes. Now, however, Lord Kṛṣṇa clearly indicates that <i>bhakti-yoga</i> is the only real means to totally free oneself from material existence, and that <i>bhakti-yoga</i> is not possible without <i>sat-saṅga, - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ-สงฺค,</span></i> or association with other Vaiṣṇavas. On the path of <i>bhakti-miśra jñāna, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-มิศฺร ชฺญาน,</span></i> or speculation on the Absolute Truth mixed with devotion, one is still affected by the three modes of material nature. The pure soul, liberated from all material qualities, has no tendency or desire to engage in philosophical speculation, severe austerities or impersonal meditation. The pure soul simply loves Kṛṣṇa and wants to serve Him constantly. <i>Jīvera ‘svarūpa’ haya - <span style="color:#990012">ชีเวรสฺวรูป′ หย</span></i> — <i>kṛṣṇera ‘nitya-dāsa.’ - <span style="color:#990012">กฺเฤษฺณรนิตฺย-ทาส.′</span></i> Pure devotional service to the Lord is called <i>kevala-bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">เกวล-ภกฺติ,</span></i> whereas devotional service mixed with speculative propensities is called <i>guṇa-bhūta-bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">คุณ-ภูต-ภกฺติ,</span></i> or devotional service polluted by the material modes of nature. One who is actually intelligent does not make a show of philosophical wizardry but rather discerns the superiority of pure love of Godhead and takes to the path of <i>kevala-bhakti. - <span style="color:#990012">เกวล-ภกฺติ.</span></i> One who emphasizes so-called intellectual achievements is actually less intelligent, because such a person is more attracted to intelligence than to the pure soul, which is superior. It should be understood, however, that pure devotional service is not nonphilosophical or anti-intellectual. The Absolute Truth is far more extensive than partial truth. Therefore, one who is in full knowledge of Lord Kṛṣṇa has the greatest facility to engage in philosophical analysis, since a pure devotee is working with the entire range of conceptual categories. Those who do not know Lord Kṛṣṇa are attracted to the impersonal Brahman or the localized Paramātmā, but they are not aware of the ultimate category of understanding called Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lacking knowledge of Bhagavān, such imperfect philosophers certainly do not understand the expansion, interaction and withdrawal of the Lord’s innumerable potencies and thus cannot fully analyze them. By faithfully accepting everything Lord Kṛṣṇa speaks as the absolute truth, one comes to the mature platform of philosophy and achieves perfect knowledge.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79650" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In addition to philosophical or intellectual understanding, pure devotional service also awards all other benefits in life, both material and spiritual; therefore one who for any purpose whatsoever accepts a process other than devotional service has unfortunately misunderstood the nature of pure devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is emphasized here that one must cultivate devotional service in the association of other devotees. On the other hand, the <i>jñāna-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-โยค</span></i> process is cultivated alone, because it is difficult for even two mental speculators to be in the same place without their association degenerating into constant quarrel. Other processes of self-realization are compared to the nipples on a goat’s neck. They look just like breast nipples, but they will not give any milk whatsoever. In this regard Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has quoted the following verses, spoken by Śrī Uddhava, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Nārada Muni respectively.</p></div>
