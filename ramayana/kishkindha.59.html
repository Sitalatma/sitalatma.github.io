<h2>Kishkindha kanda</h2>


<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 59<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Sampāti details his narration telling monkeys as to how he knew the abduction of Seetha. He says that his son Supārshva is the
eyewitness in her abduction and narrates that account to monkeys, which his son narrated to him.</p>
<p class="tat">
A word about this and next four chapters. These chapters from 59 to 63 do not find place in various other mms, besides having some
contradictory statements in their verses. Hence, these are said to be interpolated chapters. However, if it is questioned as to why they are still
being incorporated in translations, in spite of the irregularities noticed, for this the reply is 'because most ancient commentators have given
elaborate commentaries on them they are stetted...' and thus these chapters are held valid.</p>
