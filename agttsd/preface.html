<em>Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is an ever-expanding ocean of transcendental nectar. <em>Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-ka&shy;thā</em> is the ripened fruit of the realizations gained by those who constantly swim in that ocean. Relishing this fruit inspires both speaker and hearer to dive still deeper into those ambrosial waters.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp4" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
This book is a compilation of <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-ka&shy;thā</em>, specifically excerpts from lectures, letters, and assorted writings of His Holiness Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami, who is known for his aquatic dexterity within this nectar ocean. It is not meant to be a definitive work, but simply a dip into that nectar for which we are always anxious.

The prototype for this publication was a collection of unedited, roughly typed, and photocopied transcriptions entitled <em>Śri Viṣ&shy;ṇu&shy;pā&shy;da Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na Nectar</em>. Compiled by Scandinavian devotees during the early eighties, it proved to be a constant source of inspiration and strength for book distributors and devotees in general for over a decade. Updated and refined over those ten years, the prototype has now evolved into the present book, <em>All Glories to the Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na Devotees</em>.

This publication is an attempt to spread the be&shy;ne&shy;dic&shy;ting rays of the effulgent <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> moon to every corner of this world. We hope to contribute to the raising of <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> consciousness, which is a definite and practical step toward putting Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da in the center of all activities, both individually and collectively. We want to encourage and support all of those who directly or indirectly engage in this glorious <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, and we want to increase the chances of those coming into contact with Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's emotional ecstasies through his wonderful books. Anyone who touches these books will be benefited.

<p>
Our editorial policy has not been to convert the inspired words of the exemplary <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee into formal prose but to retain the lively, emotive mood in which they were originally presented. We hope that the seriousness of the subject matter will be taken into consideration and that the reader will accept this honest attempt to glorify Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His illustrious <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees.
