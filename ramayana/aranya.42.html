<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">On travelling by the aircraft like chariot Ravana and ṃāreecha enter Dandaka forest and arrive at the threshold of Rama's hermitage.
Then at the insistence of Ravana ṃāreecha assumes the form of an amazing golden Deer, and Seetha catches a sight of that deer.</p>

"If he who wields a bow, arrows and a sword, and who brandishes a weapon to only kill me happens to see me again, deem my life is

such as I am; <em>asau</em> = this one [of mine]; <em>prati rūpaḥ</em> = [my] reflected, image; <em>te</em> = [before] you; <em>vartate</em> =
carrying on - is appearing.</p>
<p class="tat">
"None can really make so bold at Rama to reappear with life, isn't it. What is appearing before you is the reflected image of mine, as
I am already slain by the wand of Yama, the Terminator, the moment I conceded to your demand.</p>

<p class="tat">
"When you are spiteful, oh, boy, indeed what can I possibly do otherwise, oh, night-walker, thither I go, may good betide you." So
said ṃāreecha to Ravana. [3-42-4]</p>

"This word of yours shows your obduracy for you are abiding under the control of my dictate, and though you were a different

shauṇDīrya </em>is the word for courageousness, <em>shauṇDīrya tyāgī vīrayoḥ : nighanṭu</em> 
The other way to tell this is: &quot;Though your words show the fear of my dictate, but on listening 
those obdurate words, it appears that you have spoken them for yourself, regaining the grit of your 
demon-hood and estimating Rama as your own enemy,&quot; by which Ravana is shirking his responsibility to 
ṃāreecha himself in the event of the death of ṃāreecha.</p>

that too ghost-faced ones, are a kind of the then sci-fi version of aircrafts. Ravana's son Indrajit also uses such spaceships in Yuddha Kanda and
his weaponry is altogether different, i.e., somewhat like the present day laser oriented hardware. These propellers may not be construed as real
donkeys or mules but some powered vehicle-drawing instruments designed to look like ordinary harmless creatures.</p>

Ravana said to ṃāreecha. [3-42-8]</p>

hermitage. ṃāreecha knows that there is no place to go away from Rama's arrow, which once chased him up to seashore. But Ravana presumes that if
ṃāreecha is capable enough, he will escape Rama, or if this old demon ṃāreecha is incapable of it, he may perhaps die by the arrow of Rama, for
which Ravana is unconcerned.</p>

Tataka's son ṃāreecha said "All right" to Ravana, and then both Ravana and ṃāreecha mounted the chariot as they would emplane an
