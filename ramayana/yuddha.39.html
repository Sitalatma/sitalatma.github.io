<p class="txt">Rama and the monkeys see the charming gardens and groves located in Lanka, viewing them from the top of Suvela mountain. Some of the
monkeys, thrilling with rapture, enter the gardens and enjoy their beauty of flowers and birds. Some others went towards Lanka; located on the apex
of Trikuta mountain. They see the city with its large mansions and seven storied buildings, including the thousand-pillared mansion of Ravana with a
height almost touching the skies.</p>
