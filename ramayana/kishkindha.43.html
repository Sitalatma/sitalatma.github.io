&#39;The Kailash mountain believed to be the abode of Shiva, the tutelary god of the Snowy Range of Central Asia and 
the wealth god Kubera, was to the north of Himalayas. It would appear to correspond with the Kwenlun Range, which 
extends northwards and connects with the Altai chain. The route indicated must have been by the south skirts of 
the desert towards the west, to pass by the Kailash Range...&#39; Ancient Geography. This is presently in Tibet.</p>

in his &#39;What Can India Teach Us?&#39; says: &#39;If I call the invasion which is generally called the invasion of the 
Shakas, or the Scythians, or the Indo-Scythians, or <em>Turushkas</em>, the Turanian invasion... 
who took possession of India, from about first century BC to the third century BC.&#39; Again classifying Sanskrit 
literature he says, &#39;we divide the whole of the Sanskrit literature into there two periods, one anterior to the 
great Turanian invasion, the other posterior to it, we may call the former period as ancient and natural, that 
of the later modern and artificial.&#39; Thus, Ramayana belonged to the modern and artificial literary period and 
Veda-s to ancient. According to Indians the <em>Turushkas</em> are not the Scythians but Turkish, 
and the <em>Yavanas,</em> are clearly the Greek. ṃichelson in his &#39;Linguistic Archaisms of 
the Ramayana...&#39;adds another phase called Epical period. Thus, there are three, Vedic, Epical, and the rest of 
it is modern and artificial. At the same time ṃax ṃuller says: &#39;At the time of Solomon, there was a channel of 
communication open between India and Syria and Palestine is established beyond doubt, I believe, by certain Sanskrit 
words which occur in the Bible such as ivory, apes, peacock, and sandalwood, which, taken together, could not 
have been exported from any country but India...&#39; So Solomon, Bible, Turanian invasion, Ramayana... all occasioned 
at one time, i.e., around 0 BC. So many professors, so many researchers have not said a date agreeable to Indians 
as well as to the world.</p>

same culture, though diverse in its practise, right from the belief of Greeks, viz., &#39;the sense of many gods are 
there near at hand&#39; to various gods, to their names, to the epical literature, and also to myths and legends and 
dramas etc, is unknown. But when it comes to dating and mapping &#39;the earliest date known for certain in Indian 
history is the invasion of Alexander in 326 BC...&#39; and &#39;The chronology has been built up form the identification 
of Sandracrottus of Greek writers with chandragupta ṃaurya... yet it is said &#39;In the seventh century BC India 
was divided into sixteen <em>ṃahajanapada-s...&#39;</em> as per &#39;An Historical 
Atlas of Indian Peninsula&quot;, Oxford. Peculiarly those sixteen Janapada-s did not contain the names of Yavana, Shaka

westwards from the early home of Indo-Europeans in South-Central-Asia, first settled in the land which we know 
as Greece about 2000 B.C....&#39; according to The Encyclopaedia of ṃyths and Legends of All Nations, Kaye &amp; Ward 
Ltd., London. Their history about Ion, the king of Helice, and his war with Elsenians, the confederacy of Lonia 
in Asia ṃinor etc., speaks about their origin and shuffling, i.e., from east to west and again from west to east. 
It is they who have adopted Vedic Rain-god <em>ṃitra</em> as their
<em>ṃithras</em> and many a temple was built all over Europe for ṃithras. Even Goddess 
Lakshmi has Her counterpart in Greece &#39;Pallas Athene&#39; known as early as 2 B.C., and the comedies of Strattis, 
like Fragmenta Comic of Greece has Indian fables as early as 400 B.C. Hence, if these Theories of Borrowing are 
negated with the Theories of Commonality, it would suffice to say that Ramayana is antecedent to the settlement 
of Greeks in Greece itself.</p>

<em>Astronomical Dating of the Ramayana</em> where another approach

Historical Atlas of the Indian Peninsula&#39; of Oxford University. Then the Yavana and Shaka should be around there, 
prior to their migration to the presently known Greece, because Greeks originated from so called &#39;South-Central-Asia&#39; 
as called by the historians, and perhaps the historians might be hesitating to call it as &#39;Himalayan region of 
India&#39;. They were originally called Ionians, a corrupt or generic name from Indian naming of Yavana or Javana. 
The word Æoni can be cleaved as <em>a + yoni; [ayogya ] yonim gata</em> &#39;unbefitting, uterus, obtained 
birth...&#39; &#39;one who is born to an unbefitting mother... say, a bastard...&#39; That is what Œdepus Rex proved later. 
The ethics of these Yavana and Shaka cultures are clearly explained in
<em>Karna-Shalya samvāda</em> &#39;the debate of Karna and Shalya...&#39; 
in <em>Karna parva, ṃaha Bharata.</em></p>

Asia, and they are the Scythes of Greeks and the Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, inhibited in the Hindu Kush Range 
of Himalayas. Both of these are categorised under ṃleccha people by Ramayana because their ethics do not conform 
to the Vedic stipulations of living, even though they lived together.</p>

religion, or sects, or the divergent philosophies of Hinduism itself, but it has agreed that ṃleccha-s are there 
and there is no bother from them. Gods of Ramayana are purely Vedic, unlike the later time, rather modern or artificial 
literary period&#39;s poetry of Kalidasa et al, and their puranic deities like Kali, Uma, and Kumara etc. The literary 
style of Ramayana is mostly un-Paninian. It has the episodes like <em>
Rama-Jābāli samvāda</em>, where Sage Jābāli being a nihilist starts preaching nihilism to Rama. When this 
epic could accommodate information about nihilists&#39; preaching nihilism to Rama, it can as well afford a few lines 
of information about other philosophies, religions, if they were to be there. Then the present day&#39;s Unity in 
Diversity is not apparent and thus it is being assigned to a post-Vedic period, where Veda-s themselves are not 
written by some good old sages with white beards, sitting under banyan trees, at any one particular time.</p>


<div id="btn24" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">Because the ancient history of Greeks came to light firstly, 
thereby India history is chronicled, and the epic Ramayana is known subsequently, relegating the history of Ramayana 
later to the Greek&#39;s invasion on India, may not be appropriate. History has its own black-ages.</p>
