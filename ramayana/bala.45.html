		The churning of ṃilk Ocean</p>

<p class="comment">
Legend/<em>purāṇa</em>: Once, when Indra was riding his elephant Iravata, Sage 
Dūrvasa came towards him and offered a garland, respecting Indra as the administrator of the universe. 
Indra decorated that garland on the head of his elephant and that elephant removed it and trampled. 
By this Dūrvasa, who is an angry sage by himself, is angered and curses Indra to fall from the grace 
and all his luxurious paraphernalia be submerged in ocean. Accordingly, Indra looses everything and 
becomes destitute, and he then approaches Vishnu. Vishnu reprimands Indra for ridiculing elderly sages 
like Dūrvasa and then plans to churn the ocean to retrieve all the lost treasures. Thus, the legend 
and the churning are going on for ages.</p>


<p class="comment">
From the <em>kundalini / power of yoga</em> point of view the churning of ocean 
is continually going on in everyone&#39;s body. The body is the ocean and at its abyss, the triangle in 
the perineal or sacral plexus is the base of ṃt. ṃandara. The churning rod is the spinal cord in the 
rod like backbone and the churning strings are the <em>ida, pingala</em> namely, 
the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. The churners are the air elements of vital forces on either 
side. This total system is held upright by Vishnu because He is <em>nārāyaṇa, nara 
+ āyaṇa </em>&#39;one who conducts humans, say created beings, into being and lead them away, again into 
His own self...&#39; When <em>kundalini power </em>is incited the first results are 
always negative like, <em>hālāha, </em>&#39;the lethal poison...&#39; and all all-ruinous 
ills befall on us. If this negativity is surrendered to someone who can handle it effortlessly, like 
Shiva, then the positivity results like <em>Amrita/Ambrosia.</em> Even if this elixir 
of life is readily available, there will be still better lures, lusts, and longings like ṃohini and 
if enchanted by those instantaneous quirks, which are yet another kind of negativity, we will be lost 
completely, like the demons. Hence &#39;churn the correct way...&#39; is the postulate of yoga.</p>
