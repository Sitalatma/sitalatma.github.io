<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			King Dasharatha commences the <font color="#B3003A">putrakāmeṣṭi</font> ritual 
			aiming to beget progeny, under the aegis of Sage Rishyasringa. The celestial beings 
			gather to receive the oblations offered in the Horse Ritual conducted by King 
			Dasharatha. They are perturbed at the atrocities of Ravana, and request Brahma 
			to think for a way to eliminate Ravana. Vishnu arrives there and pacifies Brahma 
			and other celestials with an assurance that he will incarnate as human to eliminate 
			Ravana.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Hindu mythology has no devils, but has only <em>rākshasa</em> -s, who can hardly 
			be called demons, either. Not all the rākshasa-s are evil-doers. Some of the 
			rākshasa-s are the fallen angels who take birth as mortals. They have their Vedic 
			education, and they perform Vedic rituals and penance etc., thereby they get the 
			patronage of any one of the gods among the Hindu Trinity, viz., Brahma, Vishnu, 
			and Shiva. On attaining the cherished boons, they suddenly revolt against their 
			own patron deities and commence the atrocities only to conquer the Heavens, knowing 
			well that they cannot be attained with a mortal body. In order to snub the upsurge 
			of such violence or the unnatural ascension to Heaven, the deity who gave the 
			boons seeks the help of any of the other two of the Trinity. Then one from the 
			Trinity will take birth as mortal, as an incarnation of god on earth. Usually 
			Vishnu incarnates himself to eradicate the evils created by the intrepid <em>rākshasa</em>-s.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Here the celestials bring in a preamble for Vishnu&#39;s incarnation as Rama and thus 
			the topic of Ravana occurs in this chapter of Ramayana. Ravana need not be taken 
			as an evil spirit, devil, hobgoblin or a monstrous being. He is said to be a Brahman 
			well versed in all Vedas, musicologist, and a great king of Lanka, with unlimited 
			riches, and very many of his clansmen with their vast dominions, and what not. 
			Though Brahma and Shiva bless Ravana with boons, Ravana flouts all the norms in 
			conquering Heavens in which course he did not hesitate to torture anyone who becomes 
			his personal hurdle or hindrance. Hence it is inevitable for the Trinity to curb 
			Ravana&#39;s atrocities, and Vishnu will now be requested by all the deities to incarnate 
			himself on earth. As such, the expression of the word &quot;DEṃOṇ&quot; may not always be 
			taken as an ugly and monstrous looking devil or Satan, as per the usual religious 
			conceptualisation of evil.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			In Hinduism evil is not a separate entity from humans, but available in the same 
			personification and resides along with virtue, like the two sides of a coin. These 
			rākshasa-s are also mortals, extraordinary beings with extraordinary powers like 
			god incarnates. But, with wickedness in their will, monstrosity in mind and a 
			conqueror&#39;s ambition in their heart, they are rendered themselves as demons.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			&quot;That malevolent Ravana is tormenting all the three worlds, hating the functionary 
			deities of cosmos, and always desires to assail Indra, the king of all the functionary 
			deities of universe. [1-15-8]</p>

			<p class="comment">
			There are eight functionary gods for cosmos in Hindu mythology that keep the cycle 
			of natural law going. Each one is assigned with each of the eight sides of the 
			universe along with a natural function. They are: 1] <em>Indra</em>, Heaven : 
			East, 2] <em>agni</em> Fire-god : southeast, 3] <em>yama</em> Death-god : South, 
			4] <em>naiṛiti</em> Demon-god : southwest, 5] <em>varuṇa</em> Rain-god : west, 
			6] <em>vāyu</em> Air-god : Northwest, 7] <em>kubera</em> god of wealth management 
			: North, 8] <em>īeshāna</em> god of bliss : Northeast. The governance of all 
			these deities is Indra&#39;s function, since he is the presiding deity of Heaven.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			The <em>sura</em> and <em>a-sura</em> nomenclature is the one that is commonly 
			found in Vedic literature. <em>sura</em> is a celestial being and <em>asura</em> 
			is its antonym, usually referred as a demon. Here it is not so because there are 
			many <em>asura-s</em> who made their abode in heaven, like Rahu, Ketu, and others 
			who attain salvation in this mortal life. Even Ravana came from Heaven, and returns 
			there only at the end of the war with Rama. Thus <em>a-sura-s</em> are not earthly 
			demons but celestial beings of a kind like other demi-gods, namely <em>yaksha, 
			gandharva, kinnara, kimpurusha</em> etc.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Vishnu is a four handed deity. He handles a Divine Lotus suggesting that he is 
			the creator <em>sṛiṣṭi karta</em>. An ever-cycling disc called <em>sudarshana 
			chakra</em> is handled symbolising his ever-lasting dynamism. He is the maintainer 
			of that continuous dynamism of already created Universe <em>sthithi karta</em>. 
			A mace called <em>kaumodakī</em> for bludgeoning enemies as he is the eradicator 
			of evil <em>samhāra karta</em>, and a conch-shell called <em>pānchajanya</em> 
			which produces the sound of Om, listening to which salvation, <em>mukti</em>, 
			is achieved by the true devotee. The sound of the same conch shell gives out an 
			unbearable sound in respect of enemies. He is entered here without a lotus in 
			hand. That means there is no need for a creation afresh. The other items he is 
			handling are enough to deal with Ravana. If the Lotus is not handled that hand 
			is taken as a blessing hand, <em>abhaya hasta</em>. And now he is giving that
			<em>a + bhaya</em> no fear, an assurance, to all gods.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			The expression that Vishnu has come on his eagle-vehicle has a cross-reference 
			to the previous chapter&#39;s <em>garuDa yajna vedi</em> , Eagle-shaped Altar of Fire 
			that is laid by priests of Dasharatha. It will be laid so with assumption that 
			Garuda, also called <em>suparṇa</em>, the Divine Eagle will fly in to transport 
			oblations. The Vedic ritual is also called <em>su parṇa</em>, the golden winged, 
			or great winged vehicle to conduct oblations. And the eagle-vehicle of Vishnu 
			is the quickest carrier of oblations to the deities specified in Vedic hymn. Here 
			this Garuda has already carried the oblations offered by King Dasharatha to the 
			chanting of Vedic hymns by Sage Rishyasringa to Vishnu. So Vishnu is now coming 
			mounted on the same meritorious carrier, namely Garuda. Secondly the simile of 
			Sun&#39;s coming mounted on a black cloud has some thing to do with yajna. A silver 
			cloud is no value in giving rains. The rain has got an inseparable combination 
			with Vedic ritual. Since the ritual of Dasharatha is going to fructify the rainfall 
			is due on earth. Hence, the sun on collecting all the merits called the rituals 
			of Dasharatha, in the form waters is coming riding on a black cloud to shower 
			rains. Hence Vishnu and Sun both are ready now shower their graces. Vishnu will 
			shower grace by eradicating the evil called Ravana, and the sun by showering the 
			gratuitous and cooling rains.</p>

			These three <em>hrī, shrī, kīrti</em> are the daughters of Daksha Prajapati 
			in their earlier births. The <em>hrī</em> is <em>hṛillekha</em> , virtuous disposition 
			- which Queen Kausalya has, and who begot Rama. The <em>shrī</em> is <em>shrīkāra</em> 
			, the affluence of everything, which Queen Sumitra has, by which alone she magnificently 
			and unhesitatingly advises her son Lakshmana to go along with Rama to woods. And 
			the third, <em>kīrti</em>, the glory, and the glory of Kaika is well known. The 
			position of this epic minus Kaika can be imagined, thereby her glory, may it be 
			negative, that may be imagined.</p>
