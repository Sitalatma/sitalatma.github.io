<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana proceeds to ṃāreecha seeking his help in the abduction of Seetha. He travels by his aircraft-like chariot and on way he sees
many locations along the seacoast that are affluent and divine. On seeing a banyan tree Ravana recollects the episode of Garuda, the Divine Eagle. He
arrives at the hermitage of ṃāreecha.</p>

<p class="tat">
While following up his thinking about that task he got a pertinent thought, and on deliberating about the credits and discredits,
strengths and weaknesses of that thought he decided that 'this is to be done in this method only.' On taking a decision in that way and with a firm

<p class="tat">
That lordly demon then has gone to the vehicle garage in secrecy, and directed the charioteer thus as, 'let the chariot be harnessed.'
[3-35-4]</p>
<p class="comment">This 'secretly going to his own garage...' is one among the many oddities of
Ravana that is suggested here. Kings never go to stables or garages but horses or chariots come to
their fore, if ordered. Ravana's ministers have heard Shūrpanakha's report about the destruction
of all the demons in Janasthāna. Because they have heard, it will not remain a secret or
suppressible fact, but it will spread as a wild fire. Then some action has become necessary for
Ravana now to save his face. <em>prāṇam eva parityajya mānam eva abhirakshatu</em> 'Let life go but not
the self-respect...' So, his first thinking is to wage a war with Rama, but it may become a
worthless expedition because Rama's capabilities are partially known. Next, he thought to abduct
Seetha, for she is said not only to be beautiful but a dearly cherished wife of Rama. If Seetha is
distracted from Rama, Rama may die anguishing for Seetha, thus this imminent danger, called Rama,
gets ruined once for all.</p>
<p class="comment">The human nature is<em> bhāryā duḥkham punar bhāryā</em> just 'to lament for a parted
wife for some time till a second wife is secured...' Thus, that wife-addict Rama will lament for
Seetha for some time and seeks another woman as his wife. Instead, if he starts searching for
Seetha alone, it is impossible for those two young humans to come searching this far, or to cross
the ocean, or to enter Lanka. And even on entering Lanka, it is impossible to survive further at
the hands of demons. These are some of the many of his deliberations on the 'strengths and
weaknesses and the credits and discredits...' of his thought mentioned in the verse.</p>
<p class="comment">Then he enters his beautiful vehicle garage secretly. Why a king shall behave this quirkily? Because 'walls have ears...' and what
all Shūrpanakha barked in the court must be audible throughout the palace by now, or may be all over Lanka, and if someone sees Ravana's exit at
this point of time, everyone despises him, on the charge that he is trying to bring yet another woman. Though it is not said vividly here, that he is
going to abduct Seetha thievishly keeping his valour and bravery aside, this will be made known in the words of Kumbhakarna in Yuddha Kānda. This is
shameful for his own self, as he did not do this way on previous occasions. For such a cowardly act, even Ravana's cherished wife ṃandodari may
despise or deride Ravana. So, he came to stables with a quirk of secrecy, which of course, will not remain a secret, soon.</p>

<p class="comment">Garuda held tortoise and elephant in two claws in the first instance and when to settle down on tree branch he transferred one
pray from one claw to the other and held both of them by one claw and with the other free claw he caught hold of the tree branch. But it broke under
his weight, and then suddenly without making it to fall on ground he grasped that branch with his beak and took to flight. While flying in sky he
held both the preys in claw, and the tree branch into the other. Then he started to eat his preys in sky with one claw, still upholding the branch
from falling. Seeing this feat of Garuda, the sages clinging to that tree branch bless him to be successful in his next mission and leave that
branch. When that tree branch is free from sages, Garuda throws it on a province of some antagonistic tribal community, by weight of which the whole
of that tribal community is destroyed. This is one way of telling the myth.</p>

a whole of chapter is included, inclusion of one word 'again...' is not a bothersome affair to the mythologists or interpolators. When it is
questioned that interspersing Akampana's episode defeats the spectacular entry of Ravana, the defendants say that the antagonists need not be given
such priorities. So also, Vali's Kishkindha is not portrayed in a spectacular way when Sugreeva attacked Vali for the first time, but it is detailed
in the second round, to some extent, and fully when Lakshmana enters it.</p>
<p class="comment">In this episode, a jump of event to Garuda's exploits may be jerky, but it is questioned when can Ravana recollect about Garuda's
might, why does he ignore still mightier Vishnu. Ravana's continuous fear for Vishnu made him to think of Garuda - that too, on seeing Subhadra, the
banyan tree, and that too - while going to kidnap Seetha.</p>
