<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Rama&#39;s arrow hits Vali on chest and Vali fallen down. But Vali is not dead yet. When Rama and Lakshmana 
approach dying Vali, he questions the propriety of Rama in killing him. Vali&#39;s questioning explicitly 
is straightforward befitting to the defeated mighty Vanara King. But implicitly, there are ancient commentaries 
that deduce many more meanings in picturising Vali as a devotee of Rama, who wanted to die at the hand 
of Rama, like Virādha and others, as a means of salvation.</p>

as well like the sun who falls onto earth from solar orbit when Time-ender flings him at the end of 
era; such as he is, on seeing that son of Indra, who forsooth has fallen, Rama neared him followed by 
Lakshmana. [4-17-9, 10, 11, 12a]</p>

Yayāti is the son of Nahusha, who was a king of repute. After a rigorous penance Yayāti attains heaven. 
But he starts his self-praise and goes on narrating his achievements. Indra tries to tell him that &#39;this 
is heaven, here there is no you-ness and I-ness...&#39; but in vain. Later unable to contend with Yayāti&#39;s 
self-eulogy Indra pushes him back to mortal worlds. Vali is in the same predicament as he took pride 
in his own brawny strength but now battered by still mightier person.</p>

From hereon the sentences of Vali and also of Rama in next chapter are commented variously and voluminously. 
Apart from upholding Rama&#39;s deed as a rightful one, Vali&#39;s position is also kept up, by deducing meaning 
from these utterances and Vali is pictured as a dedicate to the Absolute. ṃaheshvara Tīrtha in his
<em>Ramayana tattva dīpika</em> gives many tones for these aspects, mainly as innuendo of praise,
<em>vyāja ninda</em>.</p>

<div id="btn2" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
In this verse itself Vali&#39;s expression is said to be like this: <em>parā~Nmukha vadham kṛitvā =</em> 
&#39;one who is faced way - not in battlefield, but in the battle field like life, say from morality and 
doing all unethical things, like exiling younger brother and captivating his wife... killing of such 
an antagonist is rightful of you...&#39; For another compound <em>kaḥ atra prāptaḥ tvayā guṇaḥ</em> other 
mms use <em>kaḥ nu prāptaḥ tvayā guṇaḥ</em> in that <em>nu</em> has a special usage in Ramayana, as 
at 1-1-2 <em>konvasmin sāmpratam loke</em> etc. Here also, taking <em>kaḥ nu guṇaḥ</em> it is said 
that &#39;verily invaluable merit is achieved by you and your godhood is established by absolving me. For 
me, getting killed at your hand is no less a merit, by which I am rid of all sins, and I am now going 
to heavens...&#39; This is supported by scriptures <em>rājatva shāshan pāpasyatadāpnoti kilbiṣam</em> 
&#39;one who is rightfully punished by the king is rid of all sins&#39;; and according to the saying as well:
<em>rāja bhidhṛita daṇDāstu kṛitvā pāpāni mānavāḥ | nirmalaḥ svargam āyānti santa sukṛito 
yathā</em> and I will go to heavens without blemish&#39;.</p>

For the last compound <em>tvat kṛite nidhanam gataḥ</em> other mms use <em>shareṇa urasi tāditaḥ</em> 
&#39;with arrow, on chest, struck...&#39; establishing that Rama did not backstab Vali, but hit on chest as 
said at 4-16-35: <em>vāli vakṣasi pātitaḥ</em>.</p>

Explicitly it is Vali&#39;s harsh accusation of Rama, but implicitly it is a praise offered to Rama, since

The stress of Vali is on his animality. Being a man why killing a monkey unworthy in rituals or in diet, 
is his question. [cf. 38 and 39 verses of this chapter.] Are they just monkeys - is the subsequent question. 
If these Vanara-s were to be a just fruit-eating animals why Vali used to offer <em>sandhya</em> , time-oriented 
oblations to gods as stipulated in Veda-s, in an unusual way of swinging from one ocean to the other. 
And why Tara, who is said to be the knowers of Vedic hymns, as in previous chapter bid <em>swastyayanam</em>

Tiger&#39;s skin is used as carpet, its two canine teeth are used in golden necklaces, its other body parts 
are said to contain medicinal properties, and hence the numbers of tigers are dwindling, especially 
in India. Elephant&#39;s tusks are great decorative articles. Camel&#39;s bones are made into bangles and bracelets. 
Rhino&#39;s horn has religious use as well as a decorative article. Cāmara, Himalayan-yak&#39;s hair is used 
for royal fanning instruments. Deerskin has its own place in high religious seats of saints and sages. 
Hence the poachers are making a fortune on this fauna. But the skin, bones, or hair of monkey, or to 
that matter of fact any item of a monkey is not of any use either in religious or in medicinal or for 
decorative purposes. Hence, they are not killed for food, game or poaching.</p>

If Vali is excused, promise given to Sugreeva fails. Ravana is Vali&#39;s friend and even Ravana may come 
running to Rama seeking refuge, and then leaving Ravana without killing, leaves no fruits of incarnation. 
Vali&#39;s logic is that Ravana alone is the evil minded one in abducting Seetha. How about his own action 
in incarcerating Ruma, Sugreeva&#39;s wife? If this is asked Vali might have replied to save his face, &#39;I

&#39;As long as I am alive Sugreeva can never get a chance to rule the kingdom, because he ascended throne 
improperly and unrighteously when I am alive in the cave. Because he closed the entrance of the cave, 
wishing me to die therein, when I was still fighting with Dundubhi, I had to banish him. Now that I 
am going to heaven at your mercy, his getting the throne of Kishkindha at your mercy, and as its one 
time regent, is proper.&#39;</p>

Rama has not used any great or deadly arrow on Vali, but a third rated or lesser one is shot at, because 
Vali is still lingering with the same arrow in his chest. The same is said in Yuddha kanda, 67th chapter, 
154 verse, where Valmiki himself is amazed to say that Kumbhakarna is not killable with that sort of 
arrow which pierced through seven great sala trees, and which has killed the greatest Vali. <em>yaiḥ 
sāyakaiḥ sāla varā nikṛittā, vālī hato vānara pu~Ngavaḥ ca...</em> and narrating thus the poet 
says that Vali is nothing when compared with Kumbhakarna and others in Lanka.</p>

Killing Vali - the riddle</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left">
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4" class="comment">Vali&#39;s killing is a puzzle from the viewpoint of imperial politics 
and dharma. Hence Vali questions logically about it, even at his dying stage. The questions are as below:</font></p>

1] By killing one who is facing away, what worth is achieved by 
you?; 2] You have not punished the wrongdoer; 3] Killed one who is combating with another and an unvigilant 
one; 4] In your country or city I did no misdeed; 5] Non-guilty being is hurt; 6] Fruits, tuber eating 
being is killed; 7] No dispute of land, gold or silver; 8] You primary aspiration is to kill without 
probing into good or bad; 9] How do you face criticism by scholars?; 10] Unnecessary killers are hell-goers; 
11] Un-wearable is my skin uneatable is my flesh; 12] Five kinds of five-nailed animals are usable by 
humans; 13] I would have brought back ṃaithili in one day.</p>
