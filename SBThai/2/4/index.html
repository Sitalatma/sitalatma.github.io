        <div id="bb18356" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>satīm - <span style="color:#990012">สตีมฺ</span></i> is very significant. This means “existing” and “chaste.” And both imports are perfectly applicable in the case of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The whole Vedic adventure is to draw one’s attention entirely unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa without any diversion, as instructed in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (15.15). Fortunately Mahārāja Parīkṣit had already been attracted to the Lord from the very beginning of his body, in the womb of his mother. In the womb of his mother he was struck by the <i>brahmāstra - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมาสฺตฺร</span></i> atomic bomb released by Aśvatthāmā, but by the grace of the Lord he was saved from being burnt by the fiery weapon, and since then the King continuously concentrated his mind upon Lord Kṛṣṇa, which made him perfectly chaste in devotional service. So by natural sequence he was a chaste devotee of the Lord, and when he further heard from Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī that one should worship the Lord only and no one else, even though full of all desires or desireless, his natural affection for Kṛṣṇa was strengthened. We have already discussed these topics.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18357" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>To become a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, two things are very much essential, namely having a chance to be born in the family of a devotee and having the blessings of a bona fide spiritual master. By the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Parīkṣit Mahārāja had both opportunities. He was born in a family of such devotees as the Pāṇḍavas, and just to continue the dynasty of the Pāṇḍavas and show them special favor, the Lord specifically saved Mahārāja Parīkṣit, who later on, by the arrangement of the Lord, was cursed by the boy of a <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> and was able to get the association of such a spiritual master as Śukadeva Gosvāmī. In the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span></i> it is said that a fortunate person, by the mercy of the spiritual master and Lord Kṛṣṇa, achieves the path of devotional service. This was perfectly applicable in the case of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. By way of being born in a family of devotees, he automatically came in touch with Kṛṣṇa, and after being so contacted he constantly remembered Him. Consequently Lord Kṛṣṇa gave the King a further chance for development in devotional service by introducing him to Śukadeva Gosvāmī, a stalwart devotee of the Lord with perfect knowledge in self-realization. And by hearing from a bona fide spiritual master, he was perfectly able to concentrate his chaste mind further upon Lord Kṛṣṇa, as a matter of course.</p></div>

        <div id="bb18362" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>To become liberated means to become free from <i>dehātma-buddhi, - <span style="color:#990012">เทหาตฺม-พุทฺธิ,</span></i> the illusory attachment for personal bodily coverings and everything connected with the body, namely wife, children and all other entanglements. One selects a wife for bodily comforts, and the result is children. For wife and children one requires a dwelling place, and, as such, a residential house is also necessary. Animals like horses, elephants, cows and dogs are all household animals, and a householder has to keep them as household paraphernalia. In modern civilization the horses and elephants have been replaced by cars and conveyances with considerable horsepower. To maintain all the household affairs, one has to increase the bank balance and be careful about the treasury house, and in order to display the opulence of material assets, one has to keep good relations with friends and relatives, as well as become very careful about maintaining the status quo. This is called material civilization of material attachment. Devotion for Lord Kṛṣṇa means negation of all material attachments as detailed above. By the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Mahārāja Parīkṣit was awarded all material amenities and an undisputed kingdom in which to enjoy the undisturbed position of king, but by the grace of the Lord he was able to give up all connections with material attachment. That is the position of a pure devotee. Mahārāja Parīkṣit, due to his natural affection for Lord Kṛṣṇa as a devotee of the Lord, was always executing his royal duties on behalf of the Lord, and as a responsible king of the world he was always careful to see that the influence of Kali would not enter his kingdom. A devotee of the Lord never thinks of his household paraphernalia as his own, but surrenders everything for the service of the Lord. Thereby living entities under a devotee’s care get the opportunity for God realization by the management of a devotee-master.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18363" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Attachment for household paraphernalia and for Lord Kṛṣṇa go poorly together. One attachment is the path of darkness, and the other attachment is the path of light. Where there is light, there is no darkness, and where there is darkness, there is no light. But an expert devotee can turn everything to the path of light by an attitude of service to the Lord, and the best example here is the Pāṇḍavas. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and householders like him can turn everything to light by dovetailing so-called material assets in the service of the Lord, but one who is not trained or is unable to turn everything to the service of the Lord (<i>nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺพนฺธฮ กฺฤษฺณ-สมฺเพนฺธ</span></i>) must give up all material connections before he can be fit to hear and chant the glories of the Lord, or in other words, one who has seriously heard <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> for even one day, like Mahārāja Parīkṣit, from a fit personality like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, may be able to lose all affinity for material things. There is no utility simply in imitating Mahārāja Parīkṣit and hearing <i>Bhāgavatam</i> from professional men, even for seven hundred years. To take <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> as a means of maintaining family expenditure is the grossest type of <i>nāmāparādha - <span style="color:#990012">นามาปราธ</span></i> offense at the feet of the Lord (<i>sarva-śubha-kriyā-sāmyam api pramādaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">สรฺว-ศุภ-กฺริยา-สามฺยมฺ อปิ ปฺรมาทฮ</span></i>).</p></div>

Such regulated activities prescribed in the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> are called the <i>karma-kāṇḍīya - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑีย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑีย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑีย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑีย</span></i> conception of life, and householders are generally recommended to follow the rules just to enjoy material prosperity both in this life and in the next. Most people are attracted by such activities. Even in the activities of their modern godless civilization, people are more concerned with economic development and sense gratification without any religious sentiments. As a great emperor of the world, Mahārāja Parīkṣit had to observe such regulations of the Vedic <i>karma-kāṇḍīya</i> section, but by his slight association with Śukadeva Gosvāmī he could perfectly understand that Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Personality of Godhead (Vāsudeva), for whom he had a natural love since his birth, is everything, and thus he fixed his mind firmly upon Him, renouncing all modes of Vedic <i>karma-kāṇḍīya</i> activities. This perfectional stage is attained by a <i>jñānī - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานี</span></i> after many, many births. The <i>jñānīs - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานีสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานีสฺ,</span></i> or the empiric philosophers endeavoring for liberation, are thousands of times better than the fruitive workers, and out of hundreds of thousands of such <i>jñānīs</i> one is liberated factually. And out of hundreds of thousands of such liberated persons, even one person is rarely found who can firmly fix his mind unto the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, as declared by the Lord Himself in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (7.19). Mahārāja Parīkṣit is specially qualified with the word <i>mahā-manāḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-มนาฮ,</span></i> which puts him on an equal level with the <i>mahātmās - <span style="color:#990012">มหาตฺมาสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มหาตฺมาสฺ</span></i> described in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā. - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา.</span></i> In the later age also there have been many <i>mahātmās</i> of this type, and they also gave up all <i>karma-kāṇḍīya</i> conceptions of life, solely and wholly depending on the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya, who is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, taught us in His <i>Śikṣāṣṭaka - <span style="color:#990012">ศิกฺษาษฺฏก</span></i> (8):</p></div>

For every unknown thing, we have to learn and inquire from a learned personality. The question of creation is also one of such inquiries to be made to the right person. The spiritual master, therefore, must be one who is <i>sarva-jña, - <span style="color:#990012">สรฺว-ชฺญ,</span></i> as stated hereinbefore in connection with Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Thus all inquiries on God which are unknown to the disciple may be made from the qualified spiritual master, and here the practical example is set by Mahārāja Parīkṣit. It was, however, already known to Mahārāja Parīkṣit that everything we see is born out of the energy of the Lord, as we have all learned in the very beginning of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (<i>janmādy asya yataḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ชนฺมาทฺยฺ อสฺย ยตฮ</span></i>).

The origin of creation was known to him; otherwise he would not have inquired how the Personality of Godhead, by His different energies, creates this phenomenal world. The common man also knows that the creation is made by some creator and is not created automatically. We have no experience in the practical world that a thing is created automatically. Foolish people say that the creative energy is independent and acts automatically, as electrical energy works. But the intelligent man knows that even the electrical energy is generated by an expert engineer in the localized powerhouse, and thus the energy is distributed everywhere under the resident engineer’s supervision. The Lord’s supervision in connection with creation is mentioned even in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.10), and it is clearly said there that material energy is a manifestation of one of many such energies of the Supreme (<i>parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate - <span style="color:#990012">ปราสฺย ศกฺติรฺ วิวิไธว ศฺรูยเต</span></i>). An inexperienced boy may be struck with wonder by seeing the impersonal actions of electronics or many other wonderful things conducted by electrical energy, but an experienced man knows that behind the action is a living man who creates such energy. Similarly the so-called scholars and philosophers of the world may, by mental speculation, present so many utopian theories about the impersonal creation of the universe, but an intelligent devotee of the Lord, by studying the <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> can know that behind the creation is the hand of the Supreme Lord, just as in the generating electrical powerhouse there is the resident engineer. The research scholar finds out the cause and the effect of everything, but research scholars as great as Brahmā, Śiva, Indra and many other demigods are sometimes bewildered by seeing the wonderful creative energy of the Lord, so what to speak of the tiny mundane scholars dealing in petty things. As there are differences in the living conditions of different planets of the universe, and as one planet is superior to others, the brains of the living entities in those respective planets are also of different categorical values. As stated in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā,</i> one can compare the long duration of life of the inhabitants of Brahmā’s planet, which is inconceivable to the inhabitants of this planet earth, to the categorical value of the brain of Brahmājī, also inconceivable to any great scientist of this planet. And with such high brain power, even Brahmājī has described in his great <i>saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">สํหิตา</span></i> (<i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span></i> 5.1) as follows:</p></div>

They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be.” (Bg. 9.11) Brahmā and Śiva (and what to speak of other demigods) are <i>bhūtas, - <span style="color:#990012">ภูตสฺ,</span></i> or powerful created demigods who manage universal affairs, much like ministers appointed by a king. The ministers may be <i>īśvaras, - <span style="color:#990012">อีศฺวรสฺ,</span></i> or controllers, but the Supreme Lord is <i>maheśvara, - <span style="color:#990012">มเหศฺวร,</span></i> or the creator of the controllers. Persons with a poor fund of knowledge do not know this, and therefore they have the audacity to deride Him because He comes before us by His causeless mercy occasionally as a human being. The Lord is not like a human being. He is <i>sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha, - <span style="color:#990012">สจฺ-จิทฺ-อานนฺท-วิคฺรห,</span></i> or the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and there is no difference between His body and His soul. He is both the power and the powerful.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18404" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Mahārāja Parīkṣit did not ask his spiritual master, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, to narrate Lord Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes in Vṛndāvana; he wanted to hear first about the creation of the Lord. Śukadeva Gosvāmī did not say that the King should hear about the direct transcendental pastimes of the Lord. The time was very short, and naturally Śukadeva Gosvāmī could have gone directly to the Tenth Canto to make a shortcut of the whole thing, as generally done by the professional reciters. But neither the King nor the great speaker of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> jumped up like the organizers of <i>Bhāgavatam; - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> both of them proceeded systematically, so that both future readers and hearers might take lessons from the example of the procedure of reciting <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> Those who are under the control of the external energy of the Lord, or in other words those who are in the material world, must first of all know how the external energy of the Lord is working under the direction of the Supreme Personality, and afterwards one may try to enter into the activities of His internal energy. The mundaners are mostly worshipers of Durgā-devī, the external energy of Kṛṣṇa, but they do not know that Durgā-devī is but the shadow energy of the Lord. Behind her astonishing display of material workings is the direction of the Lord, as confirmed in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.10). The <i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span></i> affirms that Durgā-śakti is working by the direction of Govinda, and without His sanction the powerful Durgā-śakti cannot move even a blade of grass. Therefore the neophyte devotee, instead of jumping at once to the platform of transcendental pastimes presented by the internal energy of the Lord, may know how great the Supreme Lord is by inquiring about the process of His creative energy. In the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span></i> also, descriptions of the creative energy and the Lord’s hand in it are explained, and the author of <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i> has warned the neophyte devotees to be seriously on guard against the pitfall of neglecting knowledge about Kṛṣṇa in regard to how great He is. Only when one knows Lord Kṛṣṇa’s greatness can one firmly put one’s unflinching faith in Him; otherwise, like the common man, even the great leaders of men will mistake Lord Kṛṣṇa for one of the many demigods, or a historical personality, or a myth only. The transcendental pastimes of the Lord in Vṛndāvana, or even at Dvārakā, are relishable for persons who have already qualified themselves in advanced spiritual techniques, and the common man may be able to attain to such a plane by the gradual process of service and inquiries, as we shall see in the behavior of Mahārāja Parīkṣit.</p></div>

So all living entities, both in the conditioned state and in the liberated state, are maintained by the Almighty Supreme Lord. Such maintenance is effected by the Lord through His different expansions of Self and three principal energies, namely the internal, external and marginal energies. The living entities are His marginal energies, and some of them, in the confidence of the Lord, are entrusted with the work of creation also, as are Brahmā, Marīci, etc., and the acts of creation are inspired by the Lord unto them (<i>tene brahma hṛdā - <span style="color:#990012">เตเน พฺรหฺม หฺฤทา</span></i>). The external energy (<i>māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i>) is also impregnated with the <i>jīvas, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีวสฺ,</span></i> or conditioned souls. The unconditioned marginal potency acts in the spiritual kingdom, and the Lord, by His different plenary expansions, maintains them in different transcendental relations displayed in the spiritual sky. So the one Supreme Personality of Godhead manifests Himself in many (<i>bahu syām - <span style="color:#990012">พหุ สฺยามฺ</span></i>), and thus all diversities are in Him, and He is in all diversities, although He is nevertheless different from all of them.

        <div id="bb18414" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The acts of the Supreme Lord, in the creation of just this one universe, appear inconceivably wonderful. And there are innumerable universes, and all of them aggregated together are known as the created material world. And this part of His creation is only a fractional portion of the complete creation. The material world stands as a part only (<i>ekāṁśena sthito jagat - <span style="color:#990012">เอกาํเศน สฺตฺหิโต ชคตฺ</span></i>). Supposing that the material world is a display of one part of His energy, the remaining three parts consist of the <i>vaikuṇṭha-jagat - <span style="color:#990012">ไวกุณฺฐ-ชคตฺ</span></i> or spiritual world described in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> as <i>mad-dhāma - <span style="color:#990012">มทฺ-ธาม</span></i> or <i>sanātana-dhāma, - <span style="color:#990012">ธาม,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สนาตน-ธาม,</span></i> or the eternal world. We have marked in the previous verse that He creates and again winds up the creation. This action is applicable only in the material world because the other, greater part of His creation, namely the Vaikuṇṭha world, is neither created nor annihilated; otherwise the Vaikuṇṭha-dhāma would not have been called eternal. The Lord exists with His <i>dhāma,</i> or in other words with His eternal name, qualities, pastimes, entourage and personality, which are all a display of His different energies and expansions. The Lord is called <i>anādi, - <span style="color:#990012">อาทิ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อนาทิ,</span></i> or having no creator, and <i>ādi,</i> or the origin of all. We think in our own imperfect way that the Lord is also created, but the <i>Vedānta - <span style="color:#990012">เวทานฺต</span></i> informs us that He is not created. Rather, everything else is created by Him (<i>nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt - <span style="color:#990012">นารายณฮ ปโร′วฺยกฺตาตฺ</span></i>). Therefore, for the common man these are all very wonderful matters for consideration. Even for great scholars they are inconceivable, and thus such scholars present theories contradictory to one another. Even for the insignificant part of His creation, this particular universe, they have no complete information as to how far this limited space extends, or how many stars and planets are there, or the different conditions of those innumerable planets. Modern scientists have insufficient knowledge of all this. Some of them assert that there are one hundred million planets scattered all over space. In a news release from Moscow dated 2/21/60, the following piece of knowledge was relayed:</p></div>

Why then did he ask Śukadeva Gosvāmī for such information? Mahārāja Parīkṣit, being a great emperor, a descendant of the Pāṇḍavas and a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, was quite able to know considerably about the creation of the world, but that much knowledge was not sufficient. He said therefore that even greatly learned scholars fail to know about that, even after great effort. The Lord is unlimited, and His activities are also unfathomed. With a limited source of knowledge and with imperfect senses, any living being, up to the standard of Brahmājī, the highest perfect living being within the universe, can never imagine knowing about the unlimited. We can know something of the unlimited when it is explained by the unlimited, as has been done by the Lord Himself in the unique statements of the <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> and it can also be known to some extent from realized souls like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who learned it from Vyāsadeva, a disciple of Nārada, and thus the perfect knowledge can descend by the chain of disciplic succession only, and not by any form of experimental knowledge, old or modern.</p></div>

        <div id="bb18431" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the <i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span></i> it is said that the Supreme Absolute Truth, Govinda, the Personality of Godhead, although one without a second, is infallibly expanded by innumerable forms nondifferent from one another, and although He is the original person, He is still ever young with permanent youthful energy. He is very difficult to know simply by learning the transcendental science of the <i>Vedas, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> but He is very easily realized by His pure devotees.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18432" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The expansions of different forms of the Lord, as from Kṛṣṇa to Baladeva to Saṅkarṣaṇa, from Saṅkarṣaṇa to Vāsudeva, from Vāsudeva to Aniruddha, from Aniruddha to Pradyumna, and then again to the second Saṅkarṣaṇa, and from Him to the Nārāyaṇa <i>puruṣāvatāras - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษาวตารสฺ</span></i> and innumerable other forms, which are compared to the constant flowing of the uncountable waves of a river, are all one and the same. They are like lamps of equal power which kindle from one lamp to another. That is the transcendental potency of the Lord. The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> say that He is so complete that even though the whole complete identity emanates from Him, He still remains the same complete whole (<i>pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate - <span style="color:#990012">ปูรฺณสฺย ปูรฺณมฺ อาทาย ปูรฺณมฺ เอวาวศิษฺยเต</span></i>). As such, there is no validity in a material conception of the Lord produced by the mental speculator. Thus He remains always a mystery for the mundane scholar, even if he is vastly learned in the Vedic literatures (<i>vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau - <span style="color:#990012">เวเทษุ ทุรฺลภมฺ อทุรฺลภมฺ อาตฺม-ภกฺตะอุ</span></i>). Therefore, the Lord is beyond the limit of conception for mundane learned scholars, philosophers or scientists. He is easily understandable for the pure devotee because the Lord declares in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (18.54) that after surpassing the stage of knowledge, when one is able to be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, then only can one know the true nature of the Lord. One cannot have any clear conception of the Lord or His holy name, form, attributes, pastimes, etc., unless one is engaged in His transcendental loving service. The statement of the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> that one must first of all surrender unto the Lord, being freed from all other engagements, means that one must become a pure, unconditional devotee of the Lord. Only then can one know Him by the strength of devotional service.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18433" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Mahārāja Parīkṣit admitted in the previous verse that the Lord is inconceivable even for the greatest learned scholars. Why then should he again request Śukadeva Gosvāmī to clarify his insufficient knowledge about the Lord? The reason is clear. Not only was Śukadeva Gosvāmī vastly learned in the Vedic literatures, but he was also a great self-realized soul and a powerful devotee of the Lord. A powerful devotee of the Lord is, by the grace of the Lord, more than the Lord Himself. The Personality of Godhead Śrī Rāmacandra attempted to bridge the Indian Ocean to reach the island of Laṅkā, but Śrī Hanumānjī, the unalloyed devotee of the Personality of Godhead, could cross the ocean simply by jumping over it. The Lord is so merciful upon His pure devotee that He presents His beloved devotee as more powerful than Himself. The Lord expressed Himself to be unable to save Durvāsā Muni, although the Muni was so powerful that he could reach the Lord directly under material conditions. But Durvāsā Muni was saved by Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, not only is a devotee of the Lord more powerful than the Lord, but also worship of the devotee is considered more effective than direct worship of the Lord (<i>mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā - <span style="color:#990012">มทฺ-ภกฺต-ปูชาภฺยธิกา</span></i>).</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18434" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The conclusion is, therefore, that a serious devotee must first approach a spiritual master who not only is well versed in the Vedic literatures but is also a great devotee with factual realization of the Lord and His different energies. Without the help of such a devotee spiritual master, one cannot make progress in the transcendental science of the Lord. And a bona fide spiritual master like Śukadeva Gosvāmī does not speak about the Lord only in the matter of His internal potencies, but also explains how He associates with His external potencies.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18435" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord’s pastimes in the internal potency are displayed in His activities in Vṛndāvana, but the workings of His external potency are directed in His features of Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī offers his good counsel to the interested Vaiṣṇavas when he says that they should not be interested in hearing only about the Lord’s activities (like <i>rāsa-līlā - <span style="color:#990012">ราส-ลีลา</span></i>), but must be keenly interested in His pastimes in His features of the <i>puruṣāvatāras - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษาวตารสฺ</span></i> in connection with <i>sṛṣṭi-tattva, - <span style="color:#990012">สฺฤษฺฏิ-ตตฺตฺว,</span></i> creational functions, following the examples of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the ideal disciple, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the ideal spiritual master.</p></div>

As stated in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> there are two kinds of nature (<i>prakṛti - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤติ</span></i>), namely the material nature and the spiritual nature, or the external and internal potencies of the Lord. The material nature is called <i>aparā, - <span style="color:#990012">อปรา,</span></i> or inferior, and the spiritual nature is called superior or transcendental. Therefore the form of the Lord is not of the inferior, material nature. He is complete transcendence. And He is <i>mūrti, - <span style="color:#990012">มูรฺติ,</span></i> or having transcendental form. The less intelligent men, who are unaware of His transcendental form, describe Him as impersonal Brahman. But Brahman is simply the rays of His transcendental body (<i>yasya prabhā - <span style="color:#990012">ยสฺย ปฺรภา</span></i>). The devotees, who are aware of His transcendental form, render Him service; therefore the Lord also reciprocates by His causeless mercy and thus delivers His devotees from all distresses. The pious men who follow the rulings of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> are also dear to Him, and therefore the pious men of this world are also protected by Him. The impious and the nondevotees are against the principles of the <i>Vedas, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> and so such persons are always hampered from making advances in their nefarious activities. Some of them, who are specially favored by the Lord, are killed by Him personally, as in the cases of Rāvaṇa, Hiraṇyakaśipu and Kaṁsa, and thus such demons get salvation and are thereby checked from further progress in their demoniac activities. Just like a kind father, either in His favor upon the devotees or His punishment of the demons He is ever kind to everyone because He is the complete existence for all individual existence.</p></div>

According to Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī, the Lord is factually understood by the <i>paramahaṁsas - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ</span></i> only. As there is gradual realization of the transcendence from impersonal Brahman to localized Paramātmā to the Personality of Godhead, Puruṣottama, Lord Kṛṣṇa, similarly there is gradual promotion of one’s situation in the spiritual life of <i>sannyāsa. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส.</span></i> <i>Kuṭīcaka, bahūdaka, parivrājakācārya - <span style="color:#990012">กุฏีจก, พหูทก, ปริวฺราชกาจารฺย</span></i> and <i>paramahaṁsa</i> are gradual progressive stages in the renounced order of life, <i>sannyāsa, - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส,</span></i> and Queen Kuntīdevī, the mother of the Pāṇḍavas, has spoken about them in her prayers for Lord Kṛṣṇa (Canto One, Chapter Eight). The <i>paramahaṁsas</i> are generally found among both the impersonalists and the devotees, but according to <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (as clearly stated by Kuntīdevī), pure <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> is understood by the <i>paramahaṁsas, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ,</span></i> and Kuntīdevī has especially mentioned that the Lord descends (<i>paritrāṇāya sādhūnām - <span style="color:#990012">ปริตฺราณาย สาธูนามฺ</span></i>) especially to award <i>bhakti-yoga</i> to the <i>paramahaṁsas. - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ.</span></i> So ultimately the <i>paramahaṁsas,</i> in the true sense of the term, are unalloyed devotees of the Lord. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has directly accepted that the highest destination is <i>bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> by which one accepts the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Those who accept the path of <i>bhakti-yoga</i> are the factual <i>paramahaṁsas.</i></p></div>

For the pure devotees He is the constant companion, as in the case of His becoming one of the family members of the Yadu dynasty, or His becoming the friend of Arjuna, or His becoming the associate neighbor of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, as the son of Nanda-Yaśodā, the friend of Sudāmā, Śrīdāmā and Madhumaṅgala, or the lover of the damsels of Vrajabhūmi, etc. That is part of His personal features. And by His impersonal feature He expands the rays of the <i>brahmajyoti - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ,</span></i> which is limitless and all-pervasive.

In this material world there are innumerable universes like the one we can experience, and in each of them there are hundreds of thousands of planets like the one we are inhabiting. The mundaners are more or less captivated by the unlimited expansion of the rays of the Lord, but the devotees are concerned more with His personal form, from which everything is emanating (<i>janmādy asya yataḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ชนฺมาทฺยฺ อสฺย ยตฮ</span></i>). As the sun rays are concentrated in the sun disc, the <i>brahmajyoti</i> is concentrated in Goloka Vṛndāvana, the topmost spiritual planet in the spiritual sky. The immeasurable spiritual sky is full of spiritual planets, named Vaikuṇṭhas, far beyond the material sky. The mundaners have insufficient information of even the mundane sky, so what can they think of the spiritual sky? Therefore the mundaners are always far, far away from Him. Even if in the future they are able to manufacture some machine whose speed may be accelerated to the velocity of the wind or mind, the mundaners will still be unable to imagine reaching the planets in the spiritual sky. So the Lord and His residential abode will always remain a myth or a mysterious problem, but for the devotees the Lord will always be available as an associate.</p></div>

        <div id="bb18473" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The devotees need not be disappointed in the physical absence of the Lord, though they may think of not being associated with Him. The devotional process of chanting, hearing, remembering, etc. (either all or some of them, or even one of them), can give us the desired result of associating with the Lord by discharging the transcendental loving service of the Lord in the above manner. Even the very sound of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa or Rāma can at once surcharge the atmosphere spiritually. We must know definitely that the Lord is present wherever such pure transcendental service is performed, and thus the performer of offenseless <i>kīrtanam - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตนมฺ</span></i> has positive association with the Lord. Similarly, remembrance and prayers also can give us the desired result if they are properly done under expert guidance. One should not concoct forms of devotional service. One may worship the form of the Lord in a temple, or one may impersonally offer the Lord devotional prayers in a mosque or a church. One is sure to get free from the reactions of sins provided one is very careful about not committing sins willingly in expectation of getting free from the reactions by worshiping in the temple or by offering prayers in the church. This mentality of committing sins willfully on the strength of devotional service is called <i>nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">นาโมฺน พลาทฺ ยสฺย หิ ปาป-พุทฺธิฮ,</span></i> and it is the greatest offense in the discharge of devotional service. Hearing, therefore, is essential in order to keep oneself strictly on guard against such pitfalls of sins. And in order to give special stress to the hearing process, the Gosvāmī invokes all auspicious fortune in this matter.</p></div>

The culmination of the knowledge of <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> is God realization, and when one attains this stage of God realization, he naturally, voluntarily becomes a devotee of the Lord to render Him loving transcendental service. This devotional service to the Lord is always based on love of God and is distinct from the nature of routine service as prescribed in <i>karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-โยค, ชฺญาน-โยค</span></i> or <i>dhyāna-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ธฺยาน-โยค.</span></i> In the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> there are different instructions for such men of different categories, and there are various descriptions for <i>varṇāśrama-dharma, sannyāsa-dharma, yati-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม, สนฺนฺยาส-ธรฺม, ยติ-ธรฺม,</span></i> the renounced order of life, controlling the senses, meditation, perfection of mystic powers, etc., but one who fully surrenders unto the Lord to render service unto Him, out of spontaneous love for Him, factually assimilates the essence of all knowledge described in the <i>Vedas. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i> One who adopts this method very skillfully attains perfection of life at once. And this perfection of human life is called <i>brahma-gati - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-คติ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-คติ,</span></i> or the progressive march in spiritual existence. As enunciated by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī on the basis of Vedic assurances, <i>brahma-gati</i> means to attain a spiritual form as good as that of the Lord, and in that form the liberated living being eternally lives on one of the spiritual planets situated in the spiritual sky. Attainment of this perfection of life is easily available to a pure devotee of the Lord without his undergoing any difficult method of perfection. Such a devotional life is full of <i>kīrtanam, smaraṇam, īkṣaṇam, - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตนมฺ, สฺมรณมฺ, อีกฺษณมฺ,</span></i> etc., as mentioned in the previous verse. One must therefore adopt this simple way of devotional life in order to attain the highest perfection available in any category of the human form of life in any part of the world. When Lord Brahmā met Lord Kṛṣṇa as a playful child at Vṛndāvana, he offered his prayer in which he said:</p></div>

        <div id="bb18491" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Advancement of learning, a charitable disposition, political, social or religious leadership of human society, philosophical speculations, the practice of the <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> system, expertise in the Vedic rituals, and all similar high qualities in man serve one in the attainment of perfection only when they are employed in the service of the Lord. Without such dovetailing, all such qualities become sources of trouble for people in general. Everything can be utilized either for one’s own sense gratification or in the service of one other than oneself. There are two kinds of self-interest also, namely personal selfishness and extended selfishness. But there is no qualitative difference between personal and extended selfishness. Theft for personal interest or for the family interest is of the same quality — namely, criminal. A thief pleading not guilty because of committing theft not for personal interest but for the interest of society or country has never been excused by the established law of any country. People in general have no knowledge that the self-interest of a living being attains perfection only when such an interest coincides with the interest of the Lord. For example, what is the interest of maintaining body and soul together? One earns money for maintenance of the body (personal or social), but unless there is God consciousness, unless the body is being properly maintained to realize one’s relation with God, all good efforts to maintain body and soul together are similar to the attempts of the animals to maintain body and soul together. The purpose of maintaining the human body is different from that of the animals. Similarly, advancement of learning, economic development, philosophical research, study in the Vedic literature or even the execution of pious activities (like charity, opening of hospitals, and the distribution of food grains) should be done in relation with the Lord. The aim of all such acts and endeavors must be the pleasure of the Lord and not the satisfaction of any other identity, individual or collective (<i>saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam - <span style="color:#990012">สํสิทฺธิรฺ หริ-โตษณมฺ</span></i>). In the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.27) the same principle is confirmed where it is said that whatever we may give in charity and whatever we may observe in austerity must be given over to the Lord or be done on His account only. The expert leaders of a godless human civilization cannot bring about a fruitful result in all their different attempts at educational advancement or economic development unless they are God conscious. And to become God conscious one has to hear about the all-auspicious Lord, as He is described in literature like the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> and <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i></p></div>

And from the version of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the Almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general. The politicians of the world may remain in their respective positions because the pure devotees of the Lord are not interested in political leadership or diplomatic implications. The devotees are interested only in seeing that the people in general are not misguided by political propaganda and that the valuable life of a human being is not spoiled in following a type of civilization which is ultimately doomed. If the politicians, therefore, would be guided by the good counsel of the devotees, then certainly there would be a great change in the world situation by the purifying propaganda of the devotees, as shown by Lord Caitanya. As Śukadeva Gosvāmī began his prayer by discussing the word <i>yat-kīrtanam, - <span style="color:#990012">ยตฺ-กีรฺตนมฺ,</span></i> so also Lord Caitanya recommended that simply by glorifying the Lord’s holy name, a tremendous change of heart can take place by which the complete misunderstanding between the human nations created by politicians can at once be extinguished. And after the extinction of the fire of misunderstanding, other profits will follow. The destination is to go back home, back to Godhead, as we have several times discussed in these pages.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18505" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to the cult of devotion, generally known as the Vaiṣṇava cult, there is no bar against anyone’s advancing in the matter of God realization. A Vaiṣṇava is powerful enough to turn into a Vaiṣṇava even the Kirāta, etc., as above mentioned. In the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.32) it is said by the Lord that there is no bar to becoming a devotee of the Lord (even for those who are lowborn, or women, <i>śūdras - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ</span></i> or <i>vaiśyas - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺยสฺ</span></i>), and by becoming a devotee everyone is eligible to return home, back to Godhead. The only qualification is that one take shelter of a pure devotee of the Lord who has thorough knowledge in the transcendental science of Kṛṣṇa (<i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> and <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i>). Anyone from any part of the world who becomes well conversant in the science of Kṛṣṇa becomes a pure devotee and a spiritual master for the general mass of people and may reclaim them by purification of heart. Though a person be even the most sinful man, he can at once be purified by systematic contact with a pure Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava, therefore, can accept a bona fide disciple from any part of the world without any consideration of caste and creed and promote him by regulative principles to the status of a pure Vaiṣṇava, who is transcendental to brahminical culture. The system of caste, or <i>varṇāśrama-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม,</span></i> is no longer regular even amongst the so-called followers of the system. Nor is it now possible to reestablish the institutional function in the present context of social, political and economic revolution. Without any reference to the particular custom of a country, one can be accepted to the Vaiṣṇava cult spiritually, and there is no hindrance in the transcendental process. So by the order of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the cult of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> or the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> can be preached all over the world, reclaiming all persons willing to accept the transcendental cult. Such cultural propaganda by the devotees will certainly be accepted by all persons who are reasonable and inquisitive, without any particular bias for the custom of the country. The Vaiṣṇava never accepts another Vaiṣṇava on the basis of birthright, just as he never thinks of the Deity of the Lord in a temple as an idol. And to remove all doubts in this connection, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī has invoked the blessings of the Lord, who is all-powerful (<i>prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรภวิษฺณเว นมฮ</span></i>). As the all-powerful Lord accepts the humble service of His devotee in devotional activities of the <i>arcana, - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจน,</span></i> His form as the worshipable Deity in the temple, similarly the body of a pure Vaiṣṇava changes transcendentally at once when he gives himself up to the service of the Lord and is trained by a qualified Vaiṣṇava. The injunction of Vaiṣṇava regulation in this connection runs as follows: <i>arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ śrī-viṣṇor nāmni śabda-sāmānya-buddhiḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">อเรฺจฺย วิษฺณะอุ ศิลา-ธีรฺ คุรุษุ นร-มติรฺ ไวษฺณเว ชาติ-พุทฺธิฮ ศฺรี-โวิษฺณรฺ นามฺนิ ศพฺท-สามานฺย-พุทฺธิฮ,</span></i> etc. “One should not consider the Deity of the Lord as worshiped in the temple to be an idol, nor should one consider the authorized spiritual master an ordinary man. Nor should one consider a pure Vaiṣṇava to belong to a particular caste, etc.” (<i>Padma Purāṇa - <span style="color:#990012">ปทฺม ปุราณ</span></i>)</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18506" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The conclusion is that the Lord, being all-powerful, can, under any and every circumstance, accept anyone from any part of the world, either personally or through His bona fide manifestation as the spiritual master. Lord Caitanya accepted many devotees from communities other than the varṇāśramites, and He Himself declared, to teach us, that He does not belong to any caste or social order of life, but that He is the eternal servant of the servant of the Lord who maintains the damsels of Vṛndāvana (Lord Kṛṣṇa). That is the way of self-realization.</p></div>

Everyone is searching for eternal peace or eternal life, and with an aim to this destination everyone is either studying the Vedic scriptures or other religious scriptures or undergoing severe austerity as empiric philosophers, as mystic <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> or as unalloyed devotees, etc. But the Supreme Lord is perfectly realized only by the devotees because they are above all pretensions.

The <i>karmīs,</i> who are much attracted by the fruitive activities of the Vedic rituals, are called <i>bhukti-kāmī, - <span style="color:#990012">ภุกฺติ-กามี,</span></i> or those who desire material enjoyment. The <i>jñānīs,</i> who try to become one with the Supreme by mental speculation, are called <i>mukti-kāmī, - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ-กามี,</span></i> or those who desire liberation from material existence. The mystic <i>yogīs,</i> who practice different types of austerities for attainment of eight kinds of material perfection and who ultimately meet the Supersoul (Paramātmā) in trance, are called <i>siddhi-kāmī - <span style="color:#990012">สิทฺธิ-กามี</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">สิทฺธิ-กามี,</span></i> or those who desire the perfection of becoming finer than the finest, becoming heavier than the heaviest, getting everything desired, having control over everyone, creating everything liked, etc. All these are abilities of a powerful <i>yogī. - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี.</span></i> But the devotees of the Lord do not want anything like that for self-satisfaction. They want only to serve the Lord because the Lord is great and as living entities they are eternally subordinate parts and parcels of the Lord. This perfect realization of the self by the devotee helps him to become desireless, to desire nothing for his personal self, and thus the devotees are called <i>niṣkāmī - <span style="color:#990012">นิษฺกามี</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">นิษฺกามี,</span></i> without any desire. A living entity, by his constitutional position, cannot be void of all desires (the <i>bhukti-kāmī, mukti-kāmī - <span style="color:#990012">ภุกฺติ-กามี, มุกฺติ-กามี</span></i> and <i>siddhi-kāmī</i> all desire something for personal satisfaction), but the <i>niṣkāmī</i> devotees of the Lord desire everything for the satisfaction of the Lord. They are completely dependent on the orders of the Lord and are always ready to discharge their duty for the satisfaction of the Lord.</p></div>

The conclusion is, therefore, that the Lord is for everyone because no one can achieve the result of his respective desires without His sanction, but as stated by the Lord in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (8.9), all such results are awarded by Him only, for the Lord is <i>adhīśvara - <span style="color:#990012">อธีศฺวร</span></i> (the original controller) of everyone, namely the Vedāntists, the great <i>karma-kāṇḍīyas, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑียสฺ,</span></i> the great religious leaders, the great performers of austerity and all who are striving for spiritual advancement.

Everyone is seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune, but people do not know that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the beloved husband of all goddesses of fortune. In the <i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span></i> it is said that the Lord, in His transcendental abode Goloka Vṛndāvana, is accustomed to herding the <i>surabhi - <span style="color:#990012">สุรภิ</span></i> cows and is served there by hundreds of thousands of goddesses of fortune. All these goddesses of fortune are manifestations of His transcendental pleasure potency (<i>hlādinī-śakti - <span style="color:#990012">หฺลาทินี-ศกฺติ</span></i>) in His internal energy, and when the Lord manifested Himself on this earth He partially displayed the activities of His pleasure potency in His <i>rāsa-līlā - <span style="color:#990012">ราส-ลีลา</span></i> just to attract the conditioned souls, who are all after the phantasmagoria pleasure potency in degraded sex enjoyment. The pure devotees of the Lord like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who was completely detached from the abominable sex life of the material world, discussed this act of the Lord’s pleasure potency certainly not in relation to sex, but to relish a transcendental taste inconceivable to the mundaners who are after sex life. Sex life in the mundane world is the root-cause of being conditioned by the shackles of illusion, and certainly Śukadeva Gosvāmī was never interested in the sex life of the mundane world. Nor does the manifestation of the Lord’s pleasure potency have any connection with such degraded things. Lord Caitanya was a strict <i>sannyāsī - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี,</span></i> so much so that He did not allow any woman to come near Him, not even to bow down and offer respects. He never even heard the prayers of the <i>deva-dāsīs - <span style="color:#990012">เทว-ทาสีสฺ</span></i> offered in the temple of Jagannātha because a <i>sannyāsī</i> is forbidden to hear songs sung by the fair sex. Yet even in the rigid position of a <i>sannyāsī</i> He recommended the mode of worship preferred by the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> of Vṛndāvana as the topmost loving service possible to be rendered to the Lord. And Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the principal head of all such goddesses of fortune, and therefore She is the pleasure counterpart of the Lord and is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18521" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the Vedic rituals there are recommendations for performing different types of sacrifice in order to achieve the greatest benefit in life. Such benedictions as the results of performing great sacrifices are, after all, favors given by the goddess of fortune, and the Lord, being the husband or lover of the goddess of fortune, is factually the Lord of all sacrifices also. He is the final enjoyer of all kinds of <i>yajña; - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญ</span></i> therefore Yajña-pati is another name of Lord Viṣṇu. It is recommended in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that everything be done for the Yajña-pati (<i>yajñārtāt karmaṇaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญารฺตาตฺ กรฺมณฮ</span></i>), for otherwise one’s acts will be the cause of conditioning by the law of material nature. Those who are not freed from all misconceptions (<i>vyalīkam - <span style="color:#990012">วฺยลีกมฺ</span></i>) perform sacrifices to please the minor demigods, but the devotees of the Lord know very well that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer of all performances of sacrifice; therefore they perform the <i>saṅkīrtana-yajña - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน-ยชฺญ</span></i> (<i>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณํ กีรฺตนํ วิโษฺณฮ</span></i>), which is especially recommended in this Age of Kali. In Kali-yuga, performance of other types of sacrifice is not feasible due to insufficient arrangements and inexpert priesthood.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18522" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>We have information from the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (3.10-11) that Lord Brahmā, after giving rebirth to the conditioned souls within the universe, instructed them to perform sacrifices and to lead a prosperous life. With such sacrificial performances the conditioned souls will never be in difficulty in keeping body and soul together. Ultimately they can purify their existence. They will find natural promotion into spiritual existence, the real identity of the living being. A conditioned soul should never give up the practice of sacrifice, charity and austerity, in any circumstances. The aim of all such sacrifices is to please the Yajña-pati, the Personality of Godhead; therefore the Lord is also Prajā-pati. According to the <i>Kaṭha Upaniṣad, - <span style="color:#990012">กฐ อุปนิษทฺ,</span></i> the one Lord is the leader of the innumerable living entities. The living entities are maintained by the Lord (<i>eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān - <span style="color:#990012">เอโก พหูนาํ โย วิทธาติ กามานฺ</span></i>). The Lord is therefore called the supreme Bhūta-bhṛt, or maintainer of all living beings.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18523" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Living beings are proportionately endowed with intelligence in terms of their previous activities. All living beings are not equally endowed with the same quality of intelligence because behind such development of intelligence is the control of the Lord, as declared in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (15.15). As Paramātmā, Supersoul, the Lord is living in everyone’s heart, and from Him only does one’s power of remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness follow (<i>mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca - <span style="color:#990012">มตฺตฮ สฺมฺฤติรฺ ชฺญานมฺ อโปหนํ จ</span></i>). One person can sharply remember past activities by the grace of the Lord while others cannot. One is highly intelligent by the grace of the Lord, and one is a fool by the same control. Therefore the Lord is Dhiyām-pati, or the Lord of intelligence.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18524" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The conditioned souls strive to become lords of the material world. Everyone is trying to lord it over the material nature by applying his highest degree of intelligence. This misuse of intelligence by the conditioned soul is called madness. One’s full intelligence should be applied to get free from the material clutches. But the conditioned soul, due to madness only, engages his full energy and intelligence in sense gratification, and to achieve this end of life he willfully commits all sorts of misdeeds. The result is that instead of attaining an unconditional life of full freedom, the mad conditioned soul is entangled again and again in different types of bondage in material bodies. Everything we see in the material manifestation is but the creation of the Lord. Therefore He is the real proprietor of everything in the universes. The conditioned soul can enjoy a fragment of this material creation under the control of the Lord, but not self-sufficiently. That is the instruction in the <i>Īśopaniṣad. - <span style="color:#990012">อีโศปนิษทฺ.</span></i> One should be satisfied with things awarded by the Lord of the universe. It is out of madness only that one tries to encroach upon another’s share of material possessions.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18525" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord of the universe, out of His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls, descends by His own energy (<i>ātma-māyā - <span style="color:#990012">อาตฺม-มายา</span></i>) to reestablish the eternal relation of the conditioned souls with Him. He instructs all to surrender unto Him instead of falsely claiming to be enjoyers for a certain limit under His control. When He so descends He proves how much greater is His ability to enjoy, and He exhibits His power of enjoyment by, for instance, marrying sixteen thousand wives at once. The conditioned soul is very proud of becoming the husband of even one wife, but the Lord laughs at this. The intelligent man can know who is the real husband. Factually, the Lord is the husband of all the women in His creation, but a conditioned soul under the control of the Lord feels proud to be the husband of one or two wives.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18526" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>All these qualifications as the different types of <i>pati - <span style="color:#990012">ปติ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปติ</span></i> mentioned in this verse are meant for Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī has therefore especially mentioned the <i>pati</i> and <i>gati - <span style="color:#990012">คติ</span></i> of the Yadu dynasty. The members of the Yadu dynasty knew that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is everything, and all of them intended to return to Lord Kṛṣṇa after He had finished His transcendental pastimes on the earth. The Yadu dynasty was annihilated by the will of the Lord because its members had to return home with the Lord. The annihilation of the Yadu dynasty was a material show created by the Supreme Lord; otherwise the Lord and the members of the Yadu dynasty are all eternal associates. The Lord is therefore the guide of all devotees, and as such Śukadeva Gosvāmī offered Him due respects with love-laden feelings.</p></div>

        <div id="bb18534" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There is an intimate relationship between the swan and the lotus stem. So the comparison is very appropriate: without becoming a swan, or <i>paramahaṁsa, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํส,</span></i> one cannot enter into the network of the lotus feet of the Lord. As stated in the <i>Brahma-saṁhitā, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา,</span></i> the mental speculators, even by dint of learned scholarship, cannot even dream of the Absolute Truth by speculating over it for eternity. The Lord reserves the right of not being exposed to such mental speculators. And because they cannot enter into the network stem of the lotus feet of the Lord, all mental speculators differ in conclusions, and at the end they make a useless compromise by saying “as many conclusions, as many ways,” according to one’s own inclination (<i>yathā-rucam - <span style="color:#990012">ยตฺหา-รุจมฺ</span></i>). But the Lord is not like a shopkeeper trying to please all sorts of customers in the mental-speculator exchange. The Lord is what He is, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and He demands absolute surrender unto Him only. The pure devotee, however, by following the ways of previous <i>ācārya - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย</span>s - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ,</span></i> or authorities, can see the Supreme Lord through the transparent medium of a bona fide spiritual master (<i>anupaśyanti - <span style="color:#990012">อนุปศฺยนฺติ</span></i>). The pure devotee never tries to see the Lord by mental speculation, but by following in the footsteps of the <i>ācāryas</i> (<i>mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ - <span style="color:#990012">มหาชโน เยน คตฮ ส ปนฺตฺหาฮ</span></i>). Therefore there is no difference of conclusions amongst the Vaiṣṇava <i>ācāryas</i> regarding the Lord and the devotees. Lord Caitanya asserts that the living entity (<i>jīva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span></i>) is eternally the servitor of the Lord and that he is simultaneously one with and different from the Lord. This <i>tattva - <span style="color:#990012">ตตฺตฺว</span></i> of Lord Caitanya’s is shared by all four <i>sampradāyas - <span style="color:#990012">สมฺปฺรทายสฺ</span></i> of the Vaiṣṇava school (all accepting eternal servitude to the Lord even after salvation), and there is no authorized Vaiṣṇava <i>ācārya</i> who may think of the Lord and himself as one.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18535" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This humbleness of the pure devotee, who is one-hundred-percent engaged in His service, puts the devotee of the Lord in a trance by which to realize everything, because to the sincere devotee of the Lord, the Lord reveals Himself, as stated in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (10.10). The Lord, being the Lord of intelligence in everyone (even in the nondevotee), favors His devotee with proper intelligence so that automatically the pure devotee is enlightened with the factual truth about the Lord and His different energies. The Lord is revealed not by one’s speculative power or by one’s verbal jugglery over the Absolute Truth; rather, He reveals Himself to a devotee when He is fully satisfied by the devotee’s service attitude. Śukadeva Gosvāmī is not a mental speculator or compromiser of the theory of “as many ways, as many conclusions”; rather, he prays to the Lord only, invoking His transcendental pleasure. That is the way of knowing the Lord.</p></div>

A living being is sufficiently potent to possess knowledge from the Lord in the proportion of fifty sixty-fourths, or seventy-eight percent of the full knowledge acquirable. Since the living being is constitutionally part and parcel of the Lord, he is unable to assimilate all the knowledge that the Lord possesses Himself. In the conditioned state, the living being is subject to forgetting everything after a change of body, known as death. This potent knowledge is again inspired by the Lord from within the heart of every living being, and it is known as the awakening of knowledge, for it is comparable to awakening from sleep or unconsciousness. This awakening of knowledge is under the full control of the Lord, and therefore we find in the practical world different grades of knowledge in different persons. This awakening of knowledge is neither an automatic nor a material interaction. The supply source is the Lord Himself (<i>dhiyāṁ patiḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ธิยาํ ปติฮ</span></i>), for even Brahmā is also subject to this regulation of the supreme creator. In the beginning of the creation, Brahmā is born first without any father and mother because before Brahmā there were no other living beings. Brahmā is born from the lotus which grows from the abdomen of the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, and therefore he is known as Aja. This Brahmā, or Aja, is also a living being, part and parcel of the Lord, but being the most pious devotee of the Lord, Brahmā is inspired by the Lord to create, subsequent to the main creation by the Lord, through the agency of material nature. Therefore neither the material nature nor Brahmā is independent of the Lord. The material scientists can merely observe the reactions of the material nature without understanding the direction behind such activities, as a child can see the action of electricity without any knowledge of the powerhouse engineer. This imperfect knowledge of the material scientist is due to a poor fund of knowledge. The Vedic knowledge was therefore first impregnated within Brahmā, and it appears that Brahmā distributed the Vedic knowledge. Brahmā is undoubtedly the speaker of the Vedic knowledge, but actually he was inspired by the Lord to receive such transcendental knowledge, as it directly descends from the Lord. The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> are therefore called <i>apauruṣeya, - <span style="color:#990012">อปะอุรุเษย,</span></i> or not imparted by any created being. Before the creation the Lord was there (<i>nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt - <span style="color:#990012">นารายณฮ ปโร′วฺยกฺตาตฺ</span></i>), and therefore the words spoken by the Lord are vibrations of transcendental sound. There is a gulf of difference between the two qualities of sound, namely <i>prākṛta - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรากฺฤต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรากฺฤต</span></i> and <i>aprākṛta - <span style="color:#990012">อปฺรากฺฤต</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">อปฺรากฺฤต.</span></i> The physicist can deal only with the <i>prākṛta</i> sound, or sound vibrated in the material sky, and therefore we must know that the Vedic sounds recorded in symbolic expressions cannot be understood by anyone within the universe unless and until one is inspired by the vibration of supernatural (<i>aprākṛta</i>) sound, which descends in the chain of disciplic succession from the Lord to Brahmā, from Brahmā to Nārada, from Nārada to Vyāsa and so on. No mundane scholar can translate or reveal the true import of the Vedic <i>mantras - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> (hymns). They cannot be understood unless one is inspired or initiated by the authorized spiritual master. The original spiritual master is the Lord Himself, and the succession comes down through the sources of <i>paramparā, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา,</span></i> as clearly stated in the Fourth Chapter of the <i>Bhagavad-gītā. - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา.</span></i> So unless one receives the transcendental knowledge from the authorized <i>paramparā,</i> one should be considered useless (<i>niṣphalā matāḥ - <span style="color:#990012">นิษฺผลา มตาฮ</span></i>), even though one may be greatly qualified in the mundane advancements of arts or science.</p></div>

        <div id="bb18546" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As a fully dependent devotee, Śukadeva Gosvāmī (unlike a mundane man who is proud of his own capability) invokes the pleasure of the Personality of Godhead so that his statements may be successful and be appreciated by the hearers. The devotee always thinks of himself as instrumental for anything successfully carried out, and he declines to take credit for anything done by himself. The godless atheist wants to take all credit for activities, not knowing that even a blade of grass cannot move without the sanction of the Supreme Spirit, the Personality of Godhead. Śukadeva Gosvāmī therefore wants to move by the direction of the Supreme Lord, who inspired Brahmā to speak the Vedic wisdom. The truths described in the Vedic literatures are not theories of mundane imagination, nor are they fictitious, as the less intelligent class of men sometimes think. The Vedic truths are all perfect descriptions of the factual truth, without any mistake or illusion, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī wants to present the truths of creation not as a metaphysical theory of philosophical speculation, but as the actual facts and figures of the subject, since he would be dictated to by the Lord exactly in the same manner as Brahmājī was inspired. As stated in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (15.15), the Lord is Himself the father of the <i>Vedānta - <span style="color:#990012">เวทานฺต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เวทานฺต</span></i> knowledge, and it is He only who knows the factual purport of the <i>Vedānta</i> philosophy. So there is no greater truth than the principles of religion mentioned in the <i>Vedas. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i> Such Vedic knowledge or religion is disseminated by authorities like Śukadeva Gosvāmī because he is a humble devotional servitor of the Lord who has no desire to become a self-appointed interpreter without authority. That is the way of explaining the Vedic knowledge, technically known as the <i>paramparā - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา</span></i> system, or descending process.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb18547" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The intelligent man can see without mistake that any material creation (whether one’s own body or a fruit or flower) cannot beautifully grow up without the spiritual touch. The greatest intelligent man of the world or the greatest man of science can present everything very beautifully only insofar as the spirit life is there, or insomuch as the spiritual touch is there. Therefore the source of all truths is the Supreme Spirit, and not gross matter, as wrongly conceived by the gross materialist. We get information from the Vedic literature that the Lord Himself first entered the vacuum of the material universe, and thus all things gradually developed one after another. Similarly, the Lord is situated as localized Paramātmā in every individual being; hence everything is done by Him very beautifully. The sixteen principal creative elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, and the eleven sense organs, first developed from the Lord Himself and were thereby shared by the living entities. Thus the material elements were created for the enjoyment of the living entities. The beautiful arrangement behind all material manifestations is therefore made possible by the energy of the Lord, and the individual living entity can only pray to the Lord to understand it properly. Since the Lord is the supreme entity, different from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the prayer can be offered to Him. The Lord helps the living entity to enjoy material creation, but He is aloof from such false enjoyment. Śukadeva prays for the mercy of the Lord, not only for being helped personally in presenting the truth, but also for helping others to whom he would like to speak.</p></div>

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has agreed to this, but Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has made a further advance, namely that the nectar from the mouth of Lord Kṛṣṇa is transferred to His different consorts, and thus they learn the finer arts of music, dance, dressing, decorations and all such things which are relished by the Lord. Such music, dance and decorations enjoyed by the Lord are certainly not anything mundane, because the Lord is addressed in the very beginning as <i>para, - <span style="color:#990012">ปร,</span></i> or transcendental. This transcendental knowledge is unknown to the forgotten conditioned souls. Śrīla Vyāsadeva, who is the incarnation of the Lord, thus compiled the Vedic literatures to revive the lost memory of the conditioned souls about their eternal relation with the Lord. One should therefore try to understand the Vedic scriptures, or the nectar transferred by the Lord to His consorts in the conjugal humor, from the lotuslike mouth of Vyāsadeva or Śukadeva. By gradual development of transcendental knowledge, one can rise to the stage of the transcendental arts of music and dance displayed by the Lord in His <i>rāsa - <span style="color:#990012">ราส</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ราส</span>-līlā. - <span style="color:#990012">ราส-ลีลา.</span></i> But without having the Vedic knowledge one can hardly understand the transcendental nature of the Lord’s <i>rāsa</i> dance and music. The pure devotees of the Lord, however, can equally relish the nectar in the form of the profound philosophical discourses and in the form of kissing by the Lord in the <i>rāsa</i> dance, as there is no mundane distinction between the two.</p></div>
