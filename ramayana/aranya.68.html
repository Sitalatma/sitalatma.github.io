<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 68<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Jatāyu names Ravana as the abductor of Seetha while breathing his last. Though he struggles hard to 
say what all has happened, the Time called death takes him away, at such a time when the important information 
is about to be said to Rama. Receiving that much information at least, Rama consigns Jatāyu to funeral 
fire, like his own relative and performs other rites, and then proceeds for searching Seetha.</p>

fans, screens, etc., Urdu kaskas. This odd combination of trees of gold, instead of wood, and grass 
instead of leaves, is an omen of death.</p>

The daytime has fifteen spells of time that have their own effects on humans. The fifteen are:

also called as &#39;Vinda,&#39; the eleventh spell of the day.

day entails adverse effects, in so far as that aim and action of the initiator. Ravana, though an eminent 
astrologer, and though he is said to have written an astrological treatise called <em>rāvaṇa samhita</em>, 
did not care about it.</p>

lord of birds released his lives, which are unobtainable for oneself. [3-68-16]</p>

<p class="comment">
Information about Ravana is given here in the first stanza of the verse, in a half-way-through manner. 
And the character of Jatāyu itself is evanished by a jump cut of the couplet, only to be filled by 
his brother Sampāti in the later parts of Kishkindha Kanda. In between these two stanzas of one verse, 
where one brother says one stanza, the other by another, the episodes of Kishkindha come to take part. 
The second foot just contains the name of Lanka where Ravana dwells. But it is not said here for dramatic 
effect and for the flow of epic through its own course. Further, Jatāyu is not &#39;dead&#39; but he released 
his lives. And he is safeguarding his lives so far, only to tell Rama. For this Skanda Purāna says 
that Seetha blesses Jatāyu to live until Rama comes to him, and listens form Jatāyu. But she did not 
stipulate as to how much Rama has to listen or how much Jatāyu has to report.
<em>devī 
mā~N prāhaḥ rājendra yāvat sambhāṣhaṇam mama | bhavataḥ tāvat āsan me prāṇā iti āha jānakī

<p class="comment">
&#39;When a Vedic-ritual is performed the resultant factor is undoubtedly <em>puṇya</em> &#39;merit&#39; for those,
<em>yajñāḥ shīlam sadvṛittam yeṣām te</em> and the worlds <em>yā gatiḥ gamyata iti gatiḥ - lokaḥ</em>. 
And this is different to that of practising ascesis amid Five-Fires. <em>ahita agne, ahitāḥ paristhāpitāḥ 
agnayaḥ yaḥ pancāgnayoḥ yasya saḥ...</em> &#39;But animals or birds have no faculty to perform those rituals 
and they have their own course of lifecycle after their demise. Then where is the question of a bird 
going to heaven, which heaven is scheduled to some specialists...&#39; is the objection. But Jatāyu acquired 
all those &#39;merits&#39; when he combated without any retreat <em>a parā vartinām</em> and he is getting 
a short cut without undergoing too many other kinds of births, and he is given <em>mukti</em> &#39;emancipation&#39; 
from lifecycles, for his action on behalf of a godlike Rama is justifiable and befitting to get a final 
release, by word of Rama <em>by me cremated ritually and by me aptly consented to...</em> where He alone 
can transcend the manmade rules.</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Then the cremation, that too ritualistic one, is unavailable for birds and animals, how then can Rama 
perform funerals for birds, or get them performed for monkeys, as in the case of Vali...&#39; For this it 
is said, &#39;that&#39;s why Rama had to cremate Jatāyu and further said <em>by me cremated ritually and by 
me aptly consented to...</em> as sort of special sanction of <em>mukti</em>, because the animality has 
no authority in scriptures or its rites. Taking some action, endeavouring to protect <em>dharma,</em> 
or obstructing <em>a dharma</em>, itself is superior to mere reverencing a god, or performing a daily 
rot of <em>yajña, yāga-s,</em>, etc., which in itself is a subjective performance. Here Jatāyu did 
not attack Ravana keeping Rama or Seetha in view, but attacked Ravana only to play his part in stalling
<em>a dharma</em>, which is not that easy, like purchasing some temple tickets to perform some ritual, 
for and on behalf of ticket holders and their families.</p>

<p class="comment">
&nbsp;For this it is said in <em>nṛsimha purāṇa</em> 
says that <em>mat kṛite 
nidhan yasmāt tvayā prāptā tam dvijottama | tasmāt mama prasādena viṣhṇu lokam avāpyasi ||</em> 
&#39;because of me you attained your demise, thereby you get the realms of Vishnu...&#39; where &#39;because of 
me&#39; is to be taken not as an individual godhood, but as <em>dharma</em>, &#39;because of dharma...&#39; itself. 
Hence the special sanctions to Jatāyu, where such sanctions are absent in the case of Vali, as he followed 
the course of <em>a dharma</em> and there are many scripts that say Rama gave this emancipation to Jatāyu, 
in chorus <em>uvāca

&#39;Has this Rama got no other work than weeping for his beloved ones and patiently performing obsequies 
to all lowborn, lowly subjects like dead monkey, birds, or even each individual demonic soldiers... 
they are all shūdra-s&#39; is haunted feeling to some. For this it is said
<em>na shūdrā 
bhagavat bhaktā viprā bhāgavatā smṛitā | te shūdrā ye hi a bhaktā janārdane ||</em> &#39;one who 
is devotee of Vishnu cannot be called a <em>shūdra...</em> he is to be called <em>vipra, Bhāgavata...</em> 
but a non-devotee, may he be in any caste, he is a shūdra...&#39; And <em>shūdra</em> is <em>upa lakshaṇa</em> 
to birds or animals, thereby even animals and birds are on an even footing, if it comes to paying deference 
to god, and god alone is capable to decree emancipation to every or any being. &#39;Again it is said that 
Rama is god, but yet he weeps... is it not self-contradictory...&#39; Not so, when a neighbour weeps for 
the hardships of his neighbour, won&#39;t the neighbourly god weep...&#39; that too on incarnating as a human...
<em>vyasaneṣhu 
manuṣhyāṇām bhṛisham bhavati duḥkhitaḥ</em> &#39;when humans are in difficulties, He wails much...&#39; 
but waits much also, till those humans can correct or come over their problems on their own, keeping 
a little faith on Him...&#39; Here also, the sobbing of Rama is comparatively nothing when compared to the 
sobbing for Seetha, because the action of Jatāyu is not that sob-ful, in encountering <em>a dharma...</em> 
thus Valmiki is aware of &#39;good&#39; sobbing and &#39;bad&#39; sobbing in this sob-stuff, called Ramayana. </p>

<p class="comment">
Rama chants two Vedic passages <em>yāmya sūkta, nārāyaṇa sūkta - āpastamba sutra-s</em>&nbsp; as they are usually 
recited by Brahmans in such funeral rites. Here it is &#39;so imperfectly conducted, because it is for an 
ineligible bird, that too by an unrelated highborn Kshatriya Rama, reciting unconcerned Vedic hymns...&#39; 
is the objection. Jatāyu is beyond any caste or creed by way his devotion to duty and by his self-sacrifice 
while on duty. Hence, he is beyond eligibility or opposite of it. Funerals are to be conducted by one&#39;s 
own sons or nearest relatives. If none of the relatives of the dead is present to cremate, they are 
to be undertaken by the king of that kingdom. When Rama blessed the soul of Jatāyu to go to highest 
realms, which are far beyond the Veda-s of mortals, it is a sacrosanct act to chant those hymns... on 
human level; hence, Rama&#39;s action is clearly pro-Vedic. And in Vaishnavaite tenets everything culminates 
into one - Vishnu. &#39;the adherents of Vishnu, may it be an animal, like Gajendra, the elephant, or humans, 
like Shabari et al., or a bird, like Jatāyu, by Him, by Vishnu alone, they are led to the Ultimate 
course of the realm of Vishnu...&#39;</p>
