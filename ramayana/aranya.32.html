She saw Ravana who is fulgent with his own radiance, seated with ministers at his nearby in the midst of the divine aircraft Pushpaka,

<p class="comment">
The place where Ravana is sitting can be said as &#39;at the top floor of a multi-storeyed building...&#39; 
as the word <em>vimāna</em> means &#39;atop...&#39; of a house, temple-towers etc. But it can also be said Pushpaka 
aircraft as said in Dharmākūtam: <em>tatra 
ca vicitra vimāna madhyage kāncana maya āsane - -</em></p>

<p class="comment">
The words <em>upa upa viṣṭa</em> &#39;the ministers are sitting near him, and are in attendance upon him...&#39; by the 
use of extra preposition <em>upa</em>, but in the course of time the idea of &#39;nearness or proximity&#39; are lost 
and it came be used as just &#39;sitting...&#39; Thus, the tautological tendencies were influencing Sanskrit&#39;

<p class="tat">
Seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Altar of Fire, and he himself resembling
the blazing Ritual-fire spurting out of it when that Golden-Fire-Altar is drenched with plentiful ghee, she saw such a Ravana. [3-32-5]</p>
<p class="comment">Ravana is seated similar to the Sun in firmament on a supreme golden throne, which resembles a golden Fire-altar, laid with golden
bricks. ṃud-bricks will be used in Vedic-rituals in ordinary fashion, while he is a special fire in a special golden altar. When much ghee is poured
into that Golden-Fire-Altar continually, it is natural for the fire to blurt up, so also Ravana is flaring up when his needs are oblated in that
fire, and his glow is heightening with every pour of ghee-oblation, rather fulfilment of each need.</p>
<p class="comment">On conquering all the worlds Ravana assumed <em>indratva</em> 'Indra-hood.' So all the oblations in rituals shall belong to Ravana. Any
ritual other than this variety will be hindered or spoiled by this demon group. This is the real problem of all the celestials, as they are not
getting their due of oblations through Vedic-rituals. Ravana's throne, rather the seat of authority, itself is the Golden-Ritual-Altar of its kind,
and every praise, or extolment of Ravana is a hymn in his eulogy, and any offering made anywhere in his jurisdiction is an offering made into that
Ravana-Fire-Altar. That absolute power of Ravana is making him to glow to the bedazzlement of all the worlds. And how he got that Indrahood is said
next.</p>

<p class="comment">The disc of Vishnu here does not mean the <em>sudarshana cakra</em> of Vishnu. This is yet another missile which 
is one among many given to Rama by Vishvamitra. This <em>sudarshana cakra</em> is a &#39;thought of Vishnu to eliminate 
the vice...&#39; <em>sankalpa, </em>a conceptually symbolic missile in one of his hands. But in the core of its essence 
it is no disc with any sprockets and central thumb-hole etc.

<p class="comment">The problem with Ravana is that nobody shall surpass him or his boons, by conducting various Vedic-rituals, appeasing various gods
to get better boons, or say 'a boon to kill Ravana' itself. That being his preconceived fear he lets none to conduct any Vedic sacrifice. Secondly,
he has became one with Indra with the boon of Brahma. So, any ritual should be centred on Ravana, not Indra. He is not a routine Brahman slayer as he
has Brahmanic origin, and his teachers are Brahmans, and the like. But he goes against those Brahmans who dare to conduct rituals for Indra and other
divinities.</p>

<p class="comment">
Ravana is the nickname of Dashagrīva, or Dashakantha, or Dashānana, or Dashakandhara. When Ravana 
tried to lift up ṃt. Kailash with his twenty hands, on which Shiva, Parvati, Nandi, and a host of 
<em>pramatha 
gaṇa</em>-s are there, Shiva pressed down the ṃt. Kailash with his big toe. Then Ravana&#39;s twenty hands went 
under ṃt. Kailash ehereby he started to yell in pain for a thousand years, terrifying all the worlds. Then, 
as advised by his ministers Ravana extols Shiva in a <em>stotram</em>, <em>danDakam</em> a rhythmical eulogy. That heavily 
worded eulogy is still available in the name of <em>rāvaṇa kṛita daṇDaka</em>. Then, Shiva releases Ravana&#39;s 
hands from under ṃt. Kailash and blesses him to be renowned as &#39;Ravana&#39; then onward. This will be in 
the <em>uttara ramayaṇa</em> seventh book. Thus, Ravana is the etymological derivation of the word from the root 
<em>ru</em> &#39;to make noise or weep...&#39;</p>
