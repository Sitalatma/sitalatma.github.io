<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Hanuma, with his army, approaches Rama and informs him that Indrajit has killed Seetha. Rama faints away, upon hearing that news. The
monkeys sprinkle water on Rama, so that he regains consciousness. Then, Lakshmana embraces Rama and discusses with him the roles of vice and virtue
in life. After consoling Rama, Lakshmana prepares for a fight with Indrajit.</p>
