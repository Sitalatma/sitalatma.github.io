<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
On Vishvamitra&#39;s performing severe ascesis Brahma accords the sageship of &#39;Great-sage&#39; 
to him, whereas Vishvamitra&#39;s ambition is to acquire the sageship of a &#39;Brahma-sage&#39; 
Absolute-sageship. In the meanwhile, the celestial wench ṃenaka arrives at that 
place and Vishvamitra is enticed by her beauty and spends some years with her. Later, 
on realising the he should have won over lust, he further undertakes severe ascesis, 
by which gods are perturbed.</p>
