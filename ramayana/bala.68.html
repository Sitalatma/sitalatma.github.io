<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Janaka&#39;s delegation arrives at Ayodhya and submits its message to Dasharatha. Listening 
to the tidings that his son Rama not only lifted the bow of Shiva, but broke it 
as well, Dasharatha is overjoyed and refers the matter of marriage of Seetha with 
Rama to his ministers and teachers. All of the ministers and sages unanimously agree 
to that proposal and they are set to travel to Mithila the next day.</p>

<p class="tat">
Completely gone is the angst of all the legates on seeing godly Dasharatha, and 
all of them adjoing palms in reverence said this compliant and mellowly worded sentence 
to the king. [1-68-3]</p>

<p class="comment">
Because Dasharatha is caught in the tomfoolery of Kaikeyi he cannot be estimated 
as an inane personality. It is their domestic cold war. He is famous for his achievements 
and he fought wars on behalf of no lesser gods. Though Valmiki does not narrate 
Dasharatha&#39;s exploits, other scripts say a lot about them. Hence, whenever Rama&#39;s 
daring, dashing, swashbuckling is to be pictured, he will be indicated as &#39;Dasharatha&#39;s 
son...&#39; That is the reason why the angst of envoys is said in this verse as &#39;vanished&#39; 
just by a glimpse of that godly personality, which hitherto haunted them as to how 
to countenance such a powerful personality.</p>

at Mithila along with his younger brother Lakshmana, keeping Vishvamitra at his 
fore, finally carries off this girl, the well-known daughter of mine... [1-68-8]</p>

<p class="comment">
Usually this verse gives meaning that &#39;two of your valorous sons won Seetha...&#39; 
because of the usage of plural number <em>viiraiH putrakaiH</em> But this is counted 
as &#39;royal we&#39; sort of expression to honour Rama. Hence this <em>ka pratyaya</em>, 
though used in the verse, will be read as singular. There is another shade of wording 
for this verse: <em>seyam mama sutaa raajan vishvaamitrsya shaashanaat | puriim imaam samaagatya 
tava pureNa nirjitaa ||</em> which uses only singular for Rama.</p>
