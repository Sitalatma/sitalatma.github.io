<h3><em>Report to Śrī Śrī Rā&shy;dhā-Mā&shy;dha&shy;va</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp429" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
My most dear Śrī Śrī Rā&shy;dhā-Mā&shy;dha&shy;va and Sa&shy;khīs, and Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da,<br />&emsp;Please accept my most humble obeisances prostrated in the dust of Your lotus feet. All glories to You who are the Lords of the world!
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp430" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Please accept this report and kindly be merciful upon the devotees of the North European Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na Zone. Your devotees distribute Your transcendental books throughout the year, except for the Maya&shy;pur Festival time. Generally distribution starts off humbly in January as the people readjust themselves after the Christmas season and the devotees recover from their efforts during the Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da Marathon. The normal <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> day includes two hours of reading from Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books, a class, and six to eight hours of distribution. During the colder seasons the traveling saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;ners stay overnight in <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> flats or hotels, and during the warmer seasons they stay in their vans at night. About one-third of the devotees in the zone directly engage full time in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, while the remaining devotees support the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission through preaching programs in and around the temple.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp431" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
There are five marathons throughout the year. The first is a Gau&shy;ra-pūr&shy;ni&shy;mā marathon that lasts for two weeks. The second is another two-week marathon for Nṛ&shy;siṁ&shy;ha-ca&shy;tur&shy;da&shy;śī. For Jan&shy;mā&shy;ṣṭa&shy;mī/Vyāsa-pūjā there is a three-week marathon, and in October there is a three-week marathon for all the ISKCON <em>gurus</em>. During these marathons, the number of devotees going out may or may not increase, but almost everyone in the zone participates in the Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da Marathon (formerly called the Christmas Marathon) for the last five weeks of the year. During this most intense <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> experience, the programs are shorter and the mood is to increase distribution more and more. The devotees distribute ten to thirteen hours a day and think of distribution even while eating and dreaming.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp432" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The mercy of Your Lordships is readily apparent during marathon times. People who would ordinarily never buy a book take one or more. They often dance down the street with the books in their hand, and some even advertise the glories of the books to others, saying, “Look at these books! I have just met a most wonderful person selling them. You too should buy a book."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp433" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The standard distribution price is twice the BBT price. These books are valuable and not given out cheaply, because people respect books purchased for the right price. The emphasis in the zone is on mahā-big and big books, for all the devotees are eager to support the BBT's program to translate and publish books in over twenty different languages<a id="backpp433" href="#foot2">*</a> and fund the Maya&shy;pur Project. Every devotee is fully aware that the BBT sends twenty-five percent of the price of each book to support this most important project of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's in Maya&shy;pur. It inspires the devotees to distribute more and more books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp434" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men avoid cheating methods. They don't change people up or allure them with stories of starving children. They sell the books on their merit and present the philosophy as it is. This straightforward preaching strengthens the devotees and protects them from the attacks of the demons, who always want to stop book distribution at all costs.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp435" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement is <em>ān&shy;an&shy;dām&shy;budhi-var&shy;dha&shy;nam</em>. For example, Switzerland has a population of only about six million people. In that mountainous land, the small number of regular <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees (approximately eight to fifteen full-timers) have distributed more than two million mahā-big and big books during the last twelve active <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> years, and the devotees are confident that they will increase in the future. The more books people get, the more their desire increases to get more. Many positive effects have come from street distribution, and the set distribution program has been steadily increasing. Besides full-set sales, many people buy eight to ten books right on the street, and this enables the distributors to have such high daily scores. Many new <em>bhak&shy;tas</em> have joined directly from the street distribution. Our goal is to distribute many millions of books and thus force the demoniac society to change its sinful ways and surrender unto Your lotus feet. Ro&shy;hi&shy;ṇī&shy;suta Pra&shy;bhu once complained to me that every person he approached one day in Zurich already had books, and it was hard to distribute. It is a problem in such a small land.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp436" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
One of the most inspiring things for the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees is that the temple presidents personally go out on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> during the marathons. Without the presidents' full involvement in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em>, it is hard to create the proper <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mood in the temple. Almost all the presidents in the zone are former traveling <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men who have taken up the leading roles in the temples in order to expand the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement. The presidents and <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> leaders work closely together. Their combined efforts in preaching and management well support the book distribution, and the devotees on the street feel secure and inspired. Every weekend the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees hold a <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> meeting for an hour or more and discuss the latest <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> techniques and philosophy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp437" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Your wonderful <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees uplift this ISKCON movement by spreading Your glories everywhere. Please bless all Your dedicated <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men and women throughout the world and grant them the mercy available at Your lotus feet. All glories to the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees!

<h3><em>Books Are the Greatest Weapons</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp439" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
To serve Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya means to deliver His message to the fallen souls all over the world. Whoever we are and wherever we may be, our duty is to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all people, so that they can understand how, why, and what self-realization is. They don't know what it is, why they should do it, or how to do it. Therefore we give them Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books, so that they can learn what, why, and how.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp440" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When you talk to somebody, he may listen for some time, but then he either argues with you or goes away and forgets everything. Very few people can tolerate even the idea of somebody preaching to them, but taking a book is less of a commitment in their eyes. You say, “Take one of these books home; they are very nice and full of ancient wisdom," and they think,
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp441" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"If I have to listen to this person, then he's in control. But if I take a book, I'm in control. I can control a book. It's just pieces of paper. It does what I want. I can read it in my armchair at home and accept or reject it as I like. If I want it to sit on the bookshelf, it sits on the bookshelf. When I don't want it to talk to me, I don't look at it. I'm the controller. I can take a book.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp442" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You can even let them know it: “There's no difficulty or commitment. You can read it when you want. It does not demand anything of you. It only gives.” But when they open these books, Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da is preaching to them and they cannot just put him down. They have no chance to speculate or consider themselves the controller when he is speaking. They are automatically controlled until they finally surrender. But they don't know that, for it is hidden.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp443" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
These books are the greatest weapons. We are not interested in guns or other weapons; they are not practical—they sometimes make holes in one's head. The best thing is to distribute billions of books, mountains and truckloads of books. Let a rain of transcendental literature fall from the sky, but let not one touch the ground. Distribute the books on their merit. Then each book will be a powerful weapon that will enter the home and destroy the darkness of ignorance in the hearts of the masses.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp444" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Nothing can compare to the transcendental distribution of these books. Our book distribution is revolutionary because when people learn about the spiritual quality of life, they will naturally and automatically want to change the way modern society is running.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp445" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
With these words we lovingly kick you out the door to expand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by inspired preaching and book distribution, without envy or selfish interests. Don't be a miser, thinking that these books look very nice piled up in your storehouse. Pour the rain of mercy on all classes of men everywhere without any discrimination. Then everyone will get the highest benefit, both yourself and the rest of the world as well.

<h3><em>The Highest Welfare Work for Humanity</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp447" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books teach one to come out of the darkness and come to the light: “Come out of the miserable condition of material existence and become Kṛṣṇa's eternal servant! Become free from the material creation and go back home, back to Godhead, where you belong!” By distributing these books we are doing the highest welfare work for humanity at large. Sometimes people complain, "Why don't you go and get a job? Why don't you do something for the people?" But we are doing something for the people. We are giving them spiritual knowledge that frees them from the cycle of birth and death. They don't understand that we are doing the highest service for the people because they don't understand that the supreme goal of life is to surrender to Viṣ&shy;ṇu.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp448" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"Distribute books" is not a cheap slogan like "power to the people.” It is a sublime instruction that gives a process for the welfare of a world suffering under the illusory concept of life. The only solution is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. How will they ever know that they should surrender to Kṛṣṇa if they don't get Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books? On every page Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da is saying, “Surrender to Kṛṣṇa. You are not this body; you are a part of the Supreme.” Therefore our duty is clear. We should go on distributing books more and more.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp449" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Nothing is lost by distributing books. We have seen in other parts of the world that they collect like mad to acquire places of residence; but in this zone, where distributing books is the primary concern, we have seen at least three different places donated freely. In other parts of the world this is unheard of, but because of our eagerness to distribute these books, Kṛṣṇa says, “Yes. Here, take this place.” Kṛṣṇa can give us the whole world if He wants. We should try to surrender fully to Kṛṣṇa and, under His direction, preach for the sake of the entire world and distribute these books like anything.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp450" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Now we are nearing the most glorious time of the year the Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da Christmas Marathon. It is an ideal time for delivering the fallen souls. Out of sentiment, people save money all year to buy something. Therefore we bring them the transcendental gift of incalculable value. We say, “Here, if you really want to have a happy Christmas, this is the way to do it. Trans&shy;cen&shy;den&shy;ta&shy;li&shy;ze your existence; try to become spiritual.” We give them these books freely, without the mental obstruction: “Oh, will they take it?" We are bold and confident: “Here! Take it! Touch this book, read one word and you will be benefited.” What to speak of reading a few chapters of <em>Śrī&shy;mad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>! Even if a person reads a few chapters and concludes that he doesn't understand anything, he has still read a few chapters of <em>Śrī&shy;mad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>. That means in the future he will read <em>Śrī&shy;mad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> again and eventually come to the spiritual world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp451" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When we distribute books, we meditate on how it is an extraordinary activity. We are not only doing it because it pleases the spiritual master. If one thinks like that, one could think, "Oh, I can please my spiritual master if I cook a nice pizza pie." Book distribution is the highest activity. <em>Ceto-dar&shy;pa&shy;ṇa-mār&shy;ja&shy;naṁ</em>—it cleanses the mirror of the heart, the consciousness, <em>ceta</em>. <em>Bha&shy;va-mahā-dā&shy;vā&shy;gni-nir&shy;vā&shy;pa&shy;ṇaṁ</em>—it takes one out of the ocean of material suffering, material birth and death. It is the highest welfare work for humanity, because it spreads the cooling rays of the benediction moon and calms the burning fire of saṁ&shy;sā&shy;ra, repeated birth and death.

<h3><em>We Have to Beat Māyā</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp453" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It becomes clear in the Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da Marathon that there are different levels of distributors. The <em>mahā-ra&shy;this</em> can do more than five hundred books a day and the <em>ra&shy;this</em> can do four hundred. But even if you can do only five books a day, do whatever you can because we want you to taste the ecstasy of this transcendental distribution. Even if you can only do a little, you will experience the great ecstasy of this distribution. Therefore in the Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da Marathon we should empty the temples completely. Everyone, except maybe one <em>pū&shy;jā&shy;rī</em>, should go out.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp454" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We create a little social pressure at marathon time because it pushes us to go out. Otherwise we think, "Oh, the marathon. The big <em>mahā-ra&shy;this</em> will do enough. It doesn't matter if I don't do anything and go to sleep in a corner of the temple.” No! One should feel some social pressure: "Hey, what are you doing?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp455" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"Who, me? I wasn't doing anything, just cleaning the floor.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp456" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"Hey! This is no time to be wallowing in <em>māyā</em>. Get out the door!" It is good to get a kick in the pants now and then.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp457" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But then don't start thinking, “Oh, heavy! I've got to go out for four weeks and beat this one, that one, and the other one. It's going to be tough. What a struggle! My fame! If I don't defeat everybody, I won't be famous. What will the others think of me? At the end, when everyone is beating on the drums and screaming, 'Hari bol!' and it comes to my name and I'm only number ten-how terrible that will be!" If you think like that, <em>māyā</em> has already succeeded at sneaking in and capturing you. You should think, “I have to do my best. With all my energy, determination, and enthusiasm, I'll distribute these books for Kṛṣṇa.” Never think, “I've got to be number this or that. Only if I beat this dāsa or that devī dā&shy;sī will I be happy.” You have to beat <em>māyā</em> and that is all. <em>Māyā</em> tries to engage you in all sorts of artificial battles to make you miserable. We can beat <em>māyā</em> if we remain transcendental and just try to satisfy the Supreme Lord by going out and distributing as much as we can.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp458" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Our bliss comes from killing the people's demoniac mentality with these books. To kill their bodies just puts off the troubles into the future. The same demons would take birth again and create another set of troubles. Therefore we should go on with this transcendental literature distribution mission and conquer the demoniac mentality. That is the most wonderful way to satisfy Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da, get his mercy, and go back home, back to Godhead.

<h3><em>Give One Hundred Percent</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp460" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
To think that setting higher quotas will expand book distribution is a misconception. The quota is to do as much as you can. We do not say, “You must do this much,” because we are not frui&shy;tive. Therefore we never make quotas; we simply say, “Do what you can and then do some more — depend on Kṛṣṇa and see how much more He can do." Prepare yourself like that. Pray to Kṛṣṇa to become free of the tendency to hold something back. Sometimes we give only fifty percent of our capacity in a day. That is not good. We will not be losers if we give one hundred percent of our capacity. Kṛṣṇa will take care of us, He will carry what we lack and preserve what we have. He will give us the strength to conquer material nature and continue with the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp461" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;ti&shy;sid&shy;dhān&shy;ta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra used to say, “Kṛṣṇa doesn't look so much at what you are doing as at what you are holding back.” If you don't give one hundred percent to the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, you are holding back some of your energies for your own self-interest. Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform should be done as an offering to Me." Kṛṣṇa didn't say "some of the things that you do." He didn't say “part-time,” or “when you're not busy doing something else.” He said, “All of it! Give Me everything!” Still, what we are able to give is an insignificant offering because we are such limited spirit souls. To give everything to Kṛṣṇa is just enough; anything less is not enough. Kṛṣṇa doesn't look so much at what we do as at what we hold back.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp462" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
A <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee should be trained to give one hundred percent of his capacity to the service of the Supreme Lord. One devotee's capacity might be one hundred books a day and another devotee's capacity might be five hundred. If both are giving one hundred percent, they are considered equal in the eyes of the Lord. We may glorify more the one doing big, which is also good, but the Lord is satisfied to see both devotees giving one hundred percent.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp463" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
One with the capacity to increase should do so; otherwise there is a danger he will become complacent, thinking, “There is no need to do more. I have done good enough. I can stop pushing." One may think this pushing is bad, but this pushing is what keeps us Kṛṣṇa conscious. Somebody should always be lighting some fire under us, so that we feel the heat to preach more or distribute more books to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When we come back to the temple, we can have a good <em>kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and collapse in exhaustion, having given one hundred percent in the service of the Supreme Lord.

<h3><em>Determining Your Pace</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp465" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In a marathon you must learn to pace yourself. You go at such a speed that you can get into a rhythm. If you go too slow, you become lethargic. If you go too fast, you break down. It is called pacing yourself. There is no formula for finding your optimal pace because everybody is different; it must be done individually. During the marathon you distribute as you would during the rest of the year, but also let yourself get wrapped up in the energy of the marathon. Then a gradual increase will automatically take place, culminating in the last week, when you can give everything you have left to give. (This may mean that you have to spend some time in January recovering.)

In 1985 in Argentina we started a ten-year marathon. Usually people go up and down from one marathon to the next. One year they are big stars, and the next year they are gone. The "ten-year marathon list” is amazing because it shows who has steadily been going on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> over the years. Everyone should develop the commitment to go on steadily, year after year. A perfect example of this steadiness is Ro&shy;hi&shy;ṇī-suta Pra&shy;bhu, who has been going out since 1973. Through his constant endeavor he has distributed so many books. Of course, nowadays he distributes a little less because he helps others become book distributors—but he still goes out. You should think like that and have long-term vision. If you cannot do big in the marathon, don't be discouraged. Think about how your long-term, steady service will satisfy your spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa very much.

<h3><em>Books Are the Solution</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp468" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The people on the street are filled with desires, and usually the desire to have one of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books is not among them. Therefore the book distributor, as Kṛṣṇa's representative, creates within the people's hearts the desire to take these books. Otherwise, how will they ever become happy? No matter how hard they try, they cannot satisfy all their material desires.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp469" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You can tell the people what Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>—<em>jan&shy;ma - mṛ&shy;tyu - jarā - vyā&shy;dhi - duḥ&shy;kha - do&shy;ṣā&shy;nu&shy;dar&shy;śa&shy;nam</em>. You say, “My dear sir, you should be aware of the great problems of life, namely, birth, death, old age, and disease. Some rare philosophers might speculate about these problems, but most people don't speak about them because they are not aware that there is a solution. They think that death is unbeatable. Your death will also come, sir, so you should think about what you are going to do about it. These books have the only solution to the problems of birth, death, old age, and disease. Unless you study this Ve&shy;dic literature, you'll never find the solution. Never! Therefore, you must take these books."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp470" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We distribute these books to the people of the world, so that they will understand their constitutional position to love and serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and satisfy Him with the results of their activities. Everyone wants to love and be loved. Everyone wants to be peaceful, satisfied, and happy. If you show a list of these desires to anyone, he will say, “Yes, that's what I want.” But in the material world it is not possible to have peace, satisfaction, happiness, and love unless you are a devotee of the Lord. The material world simply does not have the facility to offer such satisfaction. The only way to attain all these desirable things is to take the first and topmost step toward surrender to Kṛṣṇa by buying one of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp471" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da said, “Know for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of my books.” Know it for certain! You may preach some words to somebody for a short time, but when you walk away he will forget everything you said. Therefore, we leave people with a book to refer to later. It may sit on the shelf, but it will wait for them to open it and read a few lines, pages, chapters, or maybe even the whole book. Then when they open it, they will be able to understand Kṛṣṇa because they will have heard from Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da. Even hearing a little bit about Kṛṣṇa can change their lives. Everyone who hears about Kṛṣṇa or chants Kṛṣṇa's name takes the first step on the path of gradually becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp472" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
During marathon times we should fix our minds on just distributing the mercy. The first week of a marathon is usually a little difficult. The spirit has not yet fully picked up; many devotees are coming out on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> for the first time or for the only time all year. The second week picks up substantially, and by the third week things are flying, as everyone gets into the spirit of <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. This period—the week before Christmas - is the most auspicious time of the year to distribute books. While everyone is in a time warp, foolishly spending their money on material sense gratification, we slip in. We grab the hearts of the conditioned souls and give them the greatest investment they could ever make. We give spiritual life, an investment that can satisfy all their deep desires.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp473" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
That is why we go out like madmen to distribute these books by the hundreds, thousands, and millions! What else is there to do in December? December is the time to distribute the mercy! Shut down the temples! No more problems! That is what marathon is all about. We get the mercy by distributing the mercy. It is the means to become truly satisfied. Devotees know well the art of becoming satisfied. They know that satisfaction in the material world is impossible and real satisfaction is possible only through full surrender to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, we should enthusiastically flood the world with Kṛṣṇa conscious books and spread this book distribution mission far and wide.

<h3><em>Marathon Is Nothing for the Body</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp475" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It is amazing how everybody becomes ecstatic by simply distributing Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books during the marathon. Materially it is very difficult: we are running here and there, always carrying books, and hardly getting enough sleep or proper <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em> to eat. Yet it becomes so ecstatic because it is just service and nothing for the body. When we make arrangements to ensure that the body is well taken care of, it is hard to feel ecstatic. Our minds and desires become more absorbed in the body, and we forget the spiritual energy. We forget that we are serving Kṛṣṇa and start thinking that we are enjoying. But when we are working extremely hard, even under difficult circumstances, we become very ecstatic because it has nothing to do with the body, sense gratification, or material enjoyment.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp476" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The marathon is the time to give out, and the non-marathon time is the time to absorb in. But one should always have a morning program, even during marathon. It can be compressed into thirty minutes. Don't just chant your rounds and run out the door, because you need spiritual strength.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp477" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You still should read. You can unwind at the end of the day by reading <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> book for forty minutes before taking rest. During marathon one gets into a state of madness, which has advantages and disadvantages. Maybe it is necessary to make a little sign in the van by your sleeping place, so you don't forget to read before taking rest.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp478" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It is good that the marathon inspires you to do more, but it is not good to lapse into complacency when it is over. When you have a mental concept of "Marathon!” and afterward the idea “Marathon is over,” the results fall dramatically. The distribution time between marathon and non-marathon differs maybe one hour, so the result should not reduce more than one hour's worth of distribution. You should keep on going at the same pace and maintain the marathon mood of inspiration to increase. I wish the whole year could be a <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> marathon. We should declare every year a marathon and always increase with more marathons until finally we realize that our entire existence is one big marathon.

<h3><em>Think Positive</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp480" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Since there are so many things to do for Kṛṣṇa, we should be determined not to waste any more time in pursuit of sense gratification. When we are determined in this way and go about our devotional service fearlessly, enthusiastically, and optimistically, we will surely attain success in this life. I have seen these qualities completely transform a place. When I first came to Germany, the devotees were walking around the temple, lamenting piteously: “It's hopeless. What's the use? We're finished.” Upon seeing this I made a propaganda campaign: I walked around the temple, saying, “It's hopeful. It's definitely getting better. Very good. Excellent.” I kept it a secret but tricked two devotees into taking my side in the campaign. We just kept pumping out good propaganda. After a while the devotees began to wake up and think, “It's not so bad.” They realized how good it was and started distributing ten times more than anyone else in the world. Wonderful things were done because they started thinking how auspicious, workable, and blissful everything was.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp481" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Do you know about the power of positive thinking? If you think that you are finished, then you are finished. That is why before a boxing match the two fighters come into the middle of the ring and stare at each other. One tries to look at the other stronger because as soon as one of the fighters thinks, "Now I'm finished,” although he may be stronger and better, he is finished.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp482" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We have to develop positive thinking. If you think that you can do it, then you can do it. If you think that you can distribute one thousand books a day, then somehow you will figure out how to do it. One thousand books is only twenty-five to thirty sets a day. You just have to meet thirty people who take a set. It becomes possible as soon as you start thinking that it is possible. It is a question of having the right attitude. You have to depend on Kṛṣṇa. Remember, Kṛṣṇa is God: If Kṛṣṇa desires something to happen, it happens; if He wants you to distribute one thousand books a day, you will do it, although you may not understand how it is happening. Simply link up with the desire of the Lord and do un&shy;li&shy;mi&shy;ted&shy;ly wonderful things.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp483" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Have some faith in Kṛṣṇa! The best way to develop that faith is to start thinking that it is possible —in other words, it is up to you. If you want to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and do wonderful things for Kṛṣṇa, you will. If you don't, you will not, no matter what anyone says. If you think, “Nice talk, but impractical,” then nothing will happen. Even if somebody walks up to you on the street and wants to give you a million dollars, you will think, “Ah, he doesn't want anything anyway.” One with the proper attitude thinks, “I'm Kṛṣṇa's representative and Kṛṣṇa wants wonderful things to happen," and goes out with optimism, enthusiasm, and determination. Kṛṣṇa is ready to turn over the world to you; He is just waiting for you to develop a little faith.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp484" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We come to that point by simply doing it. Some devotees say, “How can I do <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>? My head, my mind, my this, and my that… ” and we reply,
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp485" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
“Just go and do it!"<br />&emsp;"But, but, but… "<br />&emsp;"Just try it!"<br />&emsp;"But, but, but…"<br />&emsp;"Do it!"<br />&emsp;"But…"<br />&emsp;"Just go!"<br />&emsp;"All right.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp486" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Then they try, and it gets better and better. Soon they are doing fine. It is possible. Simply by trying, everything occurs. Just throw yourself into the middle of this very merciful mission, and you will attain wonderful results.

<h3><em>Distributing in the City</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp488" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You are in the big city now and not in the country, where the farmers are. City people are sophisticated, intelligent, and successful. You have to approach them properly. You have to be strong, clear, crisp, and heavy enough to break their illusion of sophistication. You have to grab them (I do not mean physically) and hold them with your spiritual strength and conviction.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp489" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You are trying to be nice guys. You approach the people with, “Oh, please, sir…” and you just get brushed aside: “Get out of here!” Being a nice guy with a big gushy heart is useless. It gets you nowhere. We have a service to do. After Arjuna heard the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>, he went onto the Battlefield of Ku&shy;ru&shy;kṣe&shy;tra and fought, and that is what you have to do. You have to do your service like a thunderbolt. It is not the time for the rose. A devotee has a rose and a thunderbolt, but he shows each according to the situation. Now is the time for the thunderbolt, so put the rose away. You cannot be such a nice guy. Purification does not necessarily mean you become a nice guy. That is what Arjuna thought before he heard the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>, and the whole <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em> deals with this illusion. There is a saying in America: “Nice guys finish last.” Everybody walks over your head if you try to be nice, because nobody is a nice guy. Do you want to give a nice picture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Are a bunch of wet dishrags a nice picture? The Christian monks already have that image, and nobody cares about them. You have to be tough. This is Kali-yuga. People respect power nowadays—not wi&shy;shy-washy dishrags.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp490" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You are such soft and sweet devotees. You are so kindhearted that you are letting the <em>kar&shy;mīs</em> go to hell. This is your mercy. Isn't that nice of you? “Oh, yes, my dear materialist, you can jump in the lake and kill yourself. You can cut your throat. You can become a dog, you'll like it.” That means you are complete fools, without the faintest idea of what you are doing. You are like a doctor who should cut away a boil but doesn't cut because the patient says, “Oh, it hurts!” and later the whole arm has to be amputated. Such a doctor is so “kind” and "pleasing.” Is that what you want to do? If it is the time to cut, then get the knife and cut! We are not sentimentalists; otherwise how could I insult everybody like this? If I were a sentimentalist, I would say, "Oh, my beloved disciples, just do your best.” Rascals, fools, and non&shy;senses: Get out there and do something!

<h3><em>Reciprocation</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp492" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
As soon as you surrender to book distribution, you directly experience Kṛṣṇa reciprocating with you at every moment. Amazing things begin to happen. Kṛṣṇa starts arranging favorable circumstances and guiding you to people who take books. This occurs because of the Lord's presence. When you simply think, "Please, Kṛṣṇa, help me distribute Your books,” Kṛṣṇa responds, “Yes, I would love to help you distribute more books.” The Supreme Lord is in the heart, and one can work in direct and constant contact with Him. Of course this connection takes time; it is not something you can do overnight or even in a few years. Yet if we surrender to Kṛṣṇa fully, He takes charge of our lives. He personally runs the life of anyone preaching for Him. Thus the book distributors are the most fortunate. They get the best chance to surrender, the best opportunity for serving, and the best facilities for going home, back to Godhead. All perfection comes to them. They are no longer bound to this material world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp493" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
A devotee comes before the Supreme Personality of Godhead full of love for the Lord. He is happy to see the Lord. But don't think that it just goes one way. The Lord is also happy to see the devotee. When the curtains open in the morning you are happy to see the Deities, and the Deities are happy to see you. Of course, the Deities are always happy because bliss is Their nature. Yet I have seen that when the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees come to the temple, the Deities are much happier. They are happy to see Their wonderful devotees before Them—chanting and dancing in ecstasy—and you become very happy to see Them happy. This is the transcendental way of loving reciprocation and relationship.

<h3><em>Real Unity</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp495" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Real unity is when the desire of the devotee and the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become one. The devotee becomes happy because he is not separated from Kṛṣṇa in any way. He becomes powerful and nobody can stop him because Kṛṣṇa's desire is so strong that it immediately becomes fact. Thus anyone who engages in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em> immediately becomes successful because Kṛṣṇa wants the living entities to be given this transcendental literature far more than we do. Kṛṣṇa wants them to come back home, back to Godhead. Therefore, wherever we are situated within this preaching mission, we should make Kṛṣṇa's desire our desire. We become convinced of what Kṛṣṇa desires from us in two ways: Kṛṣṇa inspires us from within the heart, and the spiritual master externally tells us what to do.

<h3><em>Detachment from Fruit&shy;ive Mentality</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp497" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The performer of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness process gradually realizes that he is not the doer and thus becomes detached from the fruits of his actions. Almost everyone is attached to the fruits of his actions, although attachment destroys the activity. For example, if you are distributing books and are attached to the fruit of your work, you will think about the amount of books you are distributing. Then the people on the street will look at you and think, "He's a frui&shy;tive worker like me, but he looks funny and his books look strange.” They will walk over your head without any respect, and they will not take anything. But if you are distributing to satisfy your spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya, and you are trying to help the conditioned souls, a completely different vibration comes from you. People will be drawn to you and they will gladly take a book, because they will feel that this is something special and that it involves higher principles —not that you are merely trying to make a sale. It is so important to develop this detachment from the frui&shy;tive mentality. It brings success in spiritual life. And it begins by your understanding that you are not the doer or the controller.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp498" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Kṛṣṇa sometimes allows you to become bewildered, so that you understand that you are not the controller. It is an interesting experience. Let us say you are distributing books, convinced that you are the controller. You try to act like a controller, but it doesn't work. You become bewildered. Nobody stops to listen to you. You are spinning around on the street, wondering, “What's going on?” Then Kṛṣṇa in the heart says, "Fool! Don't you know yet that you are not the controller? Why don't you surrender to Me and see what happens?" Finally you come to the point of surrender: “Kṛṣṇa! You are the controller. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare." Then amazingly things start to change. You come out of bewilderment and can serve Kṛṣṇa again. This bewildering effect of material nature is Kṛṣṇa's direct mercy on the living entities to teach them that they are not the controllers. The material nature helps us to surrender by repeatedly beating us until we realize that we are not the controllers.

<h3><em>You Cannot Cheat on the Street</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp500" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
A successful preacher in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission must conquer lust, anger, and greed from deep within his heart, because these inauspicious desires always demand but never give respect. Therefore Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya instructs us to always give respect to others without expecting respect in return and to always be tolerant like a tree, devoid of false prestige. These key qualities are necessary to perform the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission perfectly, whether one is chanting the holy name of the Lord, distributing the literature of the Lord, or preaching about the Lord. These qualities make one successful in spiritual life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp501" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Much of the preaching mission depends on the consciousness of the preacher. At <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> meetings, sometimes devotees ask for tips on technique—but technique can only take you so far. You can hold the book this way or hold the book that way; you can say it like this or say it like that. The basic techniques can be learned in a couple of days. Whenever a neophyte <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee asks an older <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee for some tips, the answer is always, “You have to surrender and learn how to depend on Kṛṣṇa. Success will come when you give up prestige, false ego, and personal satisfaction and just work for Kṛṣṇa." Still the neophyte thinks, "Oh, he's keeping the secrets to himself.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp502" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You cannot hide and cheat on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Behind an office door you can hide and cheat all you like and make a convincing show of success, because the material nature is meant for cheating. On <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> you cannot hide behind a door because there is no door. You are face to face with reality. The spiritual reality is how much you depend on Kṛṣṇa. Those without faith in Kṛṣṇa hide, and those with faith in Kṛṣṇa go out and expand that faith by practical action. Nothing expands your spiritual life better than stepping onto the street first thing in the morning with some of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. It brings you face to face with the spiritual reality that you are not the controller. You have nobody to tell what to do, nobody to do anything for you, and no minor activity to hide behind. It is just you and the people you preach to. They couldn't care less whether you are a “big devotee.” They don't even know what it means. They don't care if you are an expert in something or if others scream and shout your name. All they know is what they see right in front of them.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp503" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You are tested every minute. When you say, "Here I am, O conditioned soul. Please take this book," he looks you in the face and asks, “Why should I?” If you hesitate, “Uh, well. Uh, because you're supposed to,” you will not convince anyone. You must tell him,
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp504" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
“My dear sir, in this book you'll find answers to questions that cannot be phrased properly in the material world. The problems of life are so deep that one doesn't even know what the question is, what to speak of the answer. We've accepted a painful condition as normal, and we don't even realize that it can be questioned. Questions like, 'What am I doing? Why am I here? What am I meant to be?' aren't even allowed to be thought in the material world. In this book Ma&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja Pa&shy;rī&shy;kṣit asks the greatest authority in existence, Śu&shy;ka&shy;de&shy;va Go&shy;svā&shy;mī, the questions we should ask; but because we cannot, he does it for us. This book perfectly describes the best questions and answers. That's why you should buy one.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp505" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We are carrying living books in our hands. They are not ordinary dead literature that you forget about. This literature has never deviated from its essential message since time immemorial.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp506" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Therefore these books are important, and we must read them. How else will you get the knowledge and faith to speak about them? You cannot cheat when you are preaching. It may look good, but it will not mean anything unless you have the realization of the Supreme Absolute Truth that comes from reading and studying this transcendental literature. You cannot distribute this literature unless you know it. Therefore we insist on everybody learning. The preachers and book distributors are the scholarly representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for their lives are absorbed in these books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp507" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Not everybody has the wonderful opportunity to be absorbed in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, and some will avoid it at all costs. Yet those who take it up, at least in the Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da Marathon, realize the importance of this activity. It is the surest and most effective way to realize Kṛṣṇa.

<h3><em>Creating Enthusiasm</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp509" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When a devotee's consciousness is low, he may become cold and calculating. He squeezes as much money as he can out of “these sinful people.” When the people respond by being unenthusiastic, everything becomes a big mess as the devotee and the people become heavier and heavier with each other. The devotee's consciousness on <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is so important. He must speak to people with a feeling of love in order to inspire them to act with piety and devotion. When people meet such an enthusiastic devotee, they immediately become enthusiastic. Even if they don't understand what he is talking about, they still want to give a donation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp510" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Learning to create enthusiasm in others is very important. This enthusiasm is what the spiritual masters arouse in their disciples. Out of improper understanding the disciples may not reciprocate, but the spiritual master still instructs them and changes their understanding. Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas who understand the Absolute Truth give although no one reciprocates.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp511" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

One has to be spiritually powerful to create enthusiasm within the human society. That is the principle behind book distribution. Who is more qualified than Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da to make the human society enthusiastic? Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books are eternal. Anybody who has Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books cannot remain unenthusiastic. Therefore we are pumping them into the human society without stop, so that people will gradually become more and more enthusiastic. Often we hear how so-and-so made this or that person a devotee, but in my opinion the books make more devotees than all of us put together.

<h3><em>Distributing for the Proper Price</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp513" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
People need to understand the value of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. Thus the distributor needs to understand their value himself. When he understands, so will the people. If you approach a person, thinking, “I know you don't want this book, but I'm going to try to induce you to take it. It's as cheap as I can possibly give it, the cost of the printing. Just give something, anything. Please!" then you project this idea onto the person, and he will think, “It's not worth much, so I'll give him as little as I can get away with or nothing at all.” This is the fault of the distributor, who should understand the value of these books. One book is worth more than its weight in gold. It is the most valuable thing. Only twice the BBT price is an insult. These books would cost much more in a bookstore. We give out books so ridiculously cheap out of our mercy and because we are not greedy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp514" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
By distributing Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books in enormous quantities everywhere, people will understand what real philosophy is. Sometimes they say, “These books are too difficult to understand,” but nothing is difficult about it. Anyone can understand these books. They find it difficult because they think that “It's all one" or "It's all nothing" or that they should only eat, sleep, mate, and defend. They don't want to understand this philosophy, because they will realize that their lives are a waste of time.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp515" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
They should surrender to Kṛṣṇa and go back to Godhead, but their minds rebel against this because their senses control their minds. They think, “Since these books are telling me to surrender, it's better that I don't understand anything and put the book away.” But at some point they will have to surrender because they bought a book and didn't throw it away. That is why we don't give out these books for free. If we would, we would find them all thrown away. Instead of thinking, "What? God? Surrender? Never! Throw it out!” they think, “What? God? Surrender? Never!” and put it on the shelf. Then their children come along when no one is looking and pick out the book, and they read it, “Yes, that's right. Kṛṣṇa,” and they become devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

<h3><em>Respecting the Books</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp517" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
If someone respectfully hands you a book, you automatically become respectful. For example, in Japan they understand the value of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. In the early days people would often wash their money before giving it to the devotees, because they didn't want to give dirty money for such beautiful books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp518" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It is our responsibility to properly prepare people to receive these books. When we bring somebody to the Deity greeting, we don't walk into the temple room with our shoes on, zoom open the curtain, and say, "Here are the Deities," and then zoom shut the curtain. People should respect the Deities, so before entering the temple room, we make them take their shoes off; upon entering the temple room, we bow down, blow the conch&shy;shell, and ring the bell; and when the curtain opens, we bow down before the Deities and offer <em>āra&shy;ti</em> and prayers. It creates an atmosphere of respect for the Deities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp519" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We should keep that same respectful atmosphere around the books. I have seen books treated with disrespect, even by devotees. To throw books on the floor, cut out the verses, cut out the pictures and paste them on the wall, mark up books with notes or underlining, or tear the plastic wrapper off new books just to read them once, so that they cannot be distributed anymore, is very disrespectful and one loses the proper mood.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp520" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In some places we have ruined our image by cheating or trickery. We become merely businessmen, and the people see us as money swindlers. If we can learn some respect for ourselves and the activity of distributing transcendental literature, we will do it in a way so that nobody feels that it is something cheap. If you understand how the wonderful philosophy in these books will change the world by making a spiritual revolution in the hearts of men, you will respect these books and you will become spiritually empowered to project that respect onto others. Just by doing <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> you become a self-realized soul, and when you are self-realized you will do it better.

<h3><em>Straightforward Presentation</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp522" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
People appreciate a straightforward presentation. In New York we used to distribute in subway trains. Upon entering the train carriage, the devotees would make announcements about Indian relief work or drug rehabilitation. But being from New York, I was convinced that nobody heard much of what we said even if they wanted to, because the door was slamming shut and the train was moving. The people sitting on the train suddenly see this weird-looking guy in devotional clothing appear at the end of the carriage. He announces something and then goes around smiling and shaking a donation can. The people are trained-up: If a can is placed in front of them, they put something in it, they get something to read, and everything is OK. We used to give them the pamphlet <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Reservoir of Pleasure</em> and some <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>. The people liked it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp523" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I didn't want to waste my time vibrating mundane sounds all day, so I started to make announcements like, “By the mercy of Gau&shy;ra-Ni&shy;tāi, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading love of Godhead all over the world. You can help. Give a nickel, a dime, a quarter, a dollar, or whatever you can.” My partner and I were both from the Bronx. We used to do the Number Six train, which goes to the Bronx. All the people from the Bronx realized from our accents that we were also from the Bronx. Since I did better than everybody, soon the other distributors started making similar announcements: “By the mercy of the six Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs of Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na. By the mercy of Rā&shy;dhā-Go&shy;vi&shy;nda.” The presentation was straightforward and successful.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp524" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The biggest hang-up to success is in the mind. If you approach somebody thinking, “Oh, I'm a Hare Kṛṣṇa, and you're not going to like this," and present the book in an apologetic, negative way, you will not have much success. You must have a positive frame of mind, because you control the person with your mind. A good book distributor can take over the minds of the <em>kar&shy;mīs</em>. When he is talking, you have no choice but to listen. He knows the art of taking over someone's mind like a good salesman would, but he does it in a spiritual way and the effect is devastating.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp525" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You have to think positive and have a positive understanding. Then you can go into somebody's mind and control it by positive Kṛṣṇa conscious power. You know that what you are doing is right and good, and the person you are talking to also knows it. Therefore saying that this is Hare Kṛṣṇa is not a problem. Of course this is Hare Kṛṣṇa. Who else would do such a wonderful thing?
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp526" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>kar&shy;mī</em> considers himself a powerful person. Yet a boy has managed to stop and capture him. Through this subtle interplay, the devotee earns the respect of the <em>kar&shy;mī</em>, saying in effect, “You're so great, and yet I'm stopping you and we are having a discussion. Imagine how powerful I must be. Who is giving me that power? Just read this book!” These words are never spoken, but that is what happens.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp527" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>kar&shy;mīs</em> are on ego trips, especially in the business world; everyone is trying to overpower the others on subtle levels: “My suit is better than your suit. Look at the gold watch I have.” We should be similarly powerful and concentrated, always thinking about our purpose and depending on Kṛṣṇa in the heart.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp528" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When Ha&shy;ri&shy;nā&shy;mā&shy;nan&shy;da dāsa looks at people and his eyes lock into their eyes, they cannot stop looking at him. He hands the book to them and their hands reach out and take it, and after a while, he gives them another one and then another. He averages about seven per person, and if they take all seven without blinking, he gives them a set. Sometimes he sells two sets a day on the street. By his spiritual power he forces people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, and they never complain. They appreciate his power and walk away feeling blissful.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp529" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Not all book distributors come across super-powerful. Some are more mellow and others more kind. The girls don't come across with power but with kindness. This melts men's hearts because they don't find this quality of kindness in their wives. According to each person's capacity, each has a particular way to distribute with potency.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp530" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

<h3><em>Recognizing the Nature of Others</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp531" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Every book distributor should know basic sales techniques. They have to learn by practical experience because in every country people will present themselves in a specific manner. With some experience a distributor will be able to keep a person's attention. He has to figure out more or less what the person does by guessing or questioning — “What do you do? Where do you come from?” That forces a person to relate to you. But questions can also annoy a person, because he doesn't have any particular commitment to the situation he has run into. If you can guess a person's occupation, then he becomes amazed. A book distributor develops a second sense for it, and when he gets better and better at it, he can understand a person's mind and mood.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp532" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
At least if he understands a person's mood, then he can say things that the person relates to. A devotee has to see from the other person's point of view. If the weather is enjoyable and people are in a good mood, you can say to someone, “It's really nice out, isn't it?" You don't say, “Lousy day, isn't it?” because he is not going to relate to that. For him, today is fine, and for a <em>kar&shy;mī</em>, if it is fine one day, it is fine forever. You capture his mood, and he reciprocates with you immediately.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp533" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But sometimes you have to be really straightforward with somebody and dive directly into the business. People like it if you are businesslike when they are in a hurry. So you have to adjust. Don't start asking questions. Jump into selling the book, and the person will appreciate that. If you are standing in the rain or it is very cold, don't get into a long discourse about the books, because the person simply wants to move on. It takes a little common sense and a lot of experience. You must discriminate intelligently and judge the situations according to time, place, and circumstance.

<h3><em>Push Yourself</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp535" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
One should be a gentleman on the street and not an over-pushy salesman. Otherwise people get annoyed. They don't like to be pushed around, but they are happy to meet a gentleman who does everything nicely. One must push oneself, so that he doesn't become overwhelmed by the lower modes of nature. Pushing oneself means pushing oneself out the door and pushing oneself from person to person quickly. But when he is talking to people, he is a gentleman and doesn't push them. Pushing oneself is possible, allowed, and desired, but pushing others is not.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp536" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<em>Māyā</em>, in her form of the modes of material nature, is always trying to defeat us. Whatever little advancement we make, <em>māyā</em> pushes back with strength. If we let <em>māyā</em> push us back, we are defeated. When a devotee surrenders to <em>māyā</em>, she says, “Ah, now I have you in my clutches… ” and he chokes. But if he makes the effort, and <em>māyā</em> sees him pushing through—not paying any attention to her attempts—she lets go and becomes respectful. Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da always used to tell us, “You just make the effort. In coming to America, I had the impossible task to make people Kṛṣṇa conscious who had no idea of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who were addicted to every conceivable kind of sinful activity. I am just one man and I am old, but in my little way, I tried.” Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da was always busy trying, and because of trying he always succeeded.

<h3><em>Pray to Kṛṣṇa and Try</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp538" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
If you just pray to Kṛṣṇa and try, then you can do wonderful things. Just pray to Kṛṣṇa, “Please, my dear Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, give me Your energy to do this service that you want done.” You will be amazed at how much energy you get, amazed at what happens. But if you think, “Here I am," and the trumpets sound: “Ace distributor number one hitting the streets again,” then <em>māyā</em> blows her trumpets: “Mā&shy;yā&shy;d&shy;evī number one hitting ace distributor number one,” and you are finished. That is the way it works. Therefore you must approach this service in a humble state of mind, thinking, “O Kṛṣṇa, if I'm not careful, <em>māyā</em> will blow her trumpets and send her agents to steal me away from Your service and ruin me.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp539" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
First we have to understand that we are helpless and insignificant — just small peanuts in the crowd. We need to pray to Kṛṣṇa, “Kṛṣṇa, my Lord, inspire me from within the heart. Without You I'm nothing. Unless You help, direct, and inspire me, I can accomplish nothing.” Then one can do anything. That is not an idle claim or some nice talk. Have faith in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and daily pray, “Kṛṣṇa, I'm helpless. I have no strength on my own. Please put Your <em>śak&shy;ti</em> in me: <em>kṛṣṇa-śak&shy;ti vinā nahe tāra pra&shy;var&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Let me be a receptacle of Your energy, and I promise I will do nothing but spread Your mission all day long.” Then Kṛṣṇa is ready to give you unlimited power and potency.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp540" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The only problem is you are not ready to take it because you are puffed up, thinking you are a big man: “I! Me! I can do it. I have power.” If you think you are an expert, <em>māyā</em> immediately sends an agent to push you over. When this happens, you can understand that Kṛṣṇa arranged it to straighten you out because you weren't surrendering. So if you want success, you have to become very, very humble and totally surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no possibility of success, nor happiness, nor peace.

<h3><em>Don't Become Fried</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp542" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
During the book distribution day, sometimes devotees feel weak. It is too difficult for them to go on. In this condition some book distributors go to sleep, some sit and read, some eat <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, and some just go crazy. If you feel that you cannot go on, my advice is to stop going on. Bring yourself someplace where you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take out your bead&shy;bag, and walking back and forth, chant ten to sixteen rounds. Nothing is better than chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa to get your head together. We sometimes have to chant many rounds in one day to get ourselves together.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp543" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
After you chant, sit down and read a little. Then you will have the strength to face the cruel material world again. Then if you feel all right but notice yourself gradually weakening again, I recommend that you chant between persons. Nothing is more powerful for the saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;ner than the holy name of the Lord, and no technique is better than to chant more. Taking a nap may be enlivening if you are tired, and that is OK. But if you are in <em>māyā</em>, taking a nap is the worst thing you can do. It throws you further into the mode of ignorance, with no chance to get out.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp544" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
After many years of <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, the devotee's body may start wearing down. <em>Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is one of the most physically taxing services. One may need more than six hours of sleep (maybe seven or eight hours), especially if he was a fanatic in the early days. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da authorized the taking of more rest by the book distributors because of the heavy physical activity required, so one should not feel bad about it. One should go to bed early and get up at a good time, so that throughout the day one has enough energy to do one's service.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp545" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<em>Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees have to take care of their bodies. They should eat properly. (They should not throw some half-chewed peanuts down their throat that come out whole at the other end.) <em>Pra&shy;sād&shy;am</em> should meet a proper standard. Every <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> vehicle should have a little stove and a pressure cooker. One can cook <em>ki&shy;cha&shy;rī</em> with all kinds of vegetables in it or make <em>ca&shy;pā&shy;tīs</em>. One can have bread from the temple with sufficient, but not too much, butter and some fresh tomatoes or other fruits. One should have a healthy, balanced diet.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp546" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Of course, one should not eat so well that it becomes a sense gratification party. This has happened in the past. In the guise of taking care of their bodies, the saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;ners fell asleep after eating and never got out the door. There must be a proper balance. One should eat properly and then go out and burn up some of those calories. Hanging around in the van after <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em> means death. <em>Saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees may take a little break during the day to finish their rounds if necessary or to read a little bit to keep themselves Kṛṣṇa conscious.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp547" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I have been asking <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees to read two hours a day because they have to learn Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da told me in South Africa, “They think these books are just for selling, but actually I have written them for reading.” It is important to read these books. To distribute books for a lifetime means that one has to be firmly convinced that these books are the topmost perfection of literature in existence. You must read to purify your intelligence and develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you can read more and maintain the distribution results, it is all right to increase the allotted daily reading time. If you become so fired-up that you do the same or more than when you read less and go out all day, then it is authorized. Otherwise it is better to read two hours and go out all day.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp548" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
If one falls into <em>māyā</em> during the day, he should chant more and read a little bit. Then he should get back on his feet and immediately strike back at <em>māyā</em> again. Don't let <em>māyā</em> get the upper hand on you. But if you become so fried out that you cannot go on, you should immediately go back to the temple and tell the president. You should get another service-going on <em>ha&shy;ri&shy;nā&shy;ma</em>, distributing <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, helping in the kitchen, or worshiping the Deity. Don't worry! Every warrior in the battlefield becomes a little weak sometimes and has to go back to the base for a rest. After a short time, the spirit will well up again and you will want to go back out.

Because we love Kṛṣṇa, we also love His parts and parcels. On the streets everywhere, the living entities are suffering in material existence. Therefore we want to give them a taste of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and what it means to go back home, back to Godhead. We are distributing Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books in great quantities because we want to make Kṛṣṇa happy. Kṛṣṇa knows these living entities have rebelled against Him, and it is making Kṛṣṇa sad. To relieve the anxiety of the Lord and give Him pleasure, we want to bring the conditioned souls back to His lotus feet.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp551" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

In the <em>Bṛ&shy;had-bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tāmṛ&shy;ta</em> by Sa&shy;nā&shy;ta&shy;na Go&shy;svā&shy;mī, when Gopa Ku&shy;mā&shy;ra finally goes back to Goloka Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na, Kṛṣṇa sees him coming along the road toward His pastimes. The Lord runs toward him, embraces him in ecstasy, and falls down on the ground unconscious, thinking about His friend who has come back after such a long time. Can you imagine that? Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has got millions and billions of devotees, falls over unconscious after embracing His devotee.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp552" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We cannot understand how satisfied Kṛṣṇa is when a devotee comes back to Him, let alone how much more satisfied Kṛṣṇa is with the person who has shown that devotee how to come back to Him. Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>, “There will never be anybody more dear to Me than he who teaches this sublime secret of devotional service to the devotees.” If you become instrumental in bringing a soul back to Godhead, your going back to Godhead is assured.

<div id="pp553" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We distribute these books with the idea of giving people a chance to go back home, back to Godhead. Imagine how happy Kṛṣṇa is. He is happy because eventually these people will go back to Him. For each person we succeed in bringing back to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa becomes ecstatically overwhelmed with love.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp554" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We sometimes talk about <em>krpā-sid&shy;dha</em>, the mercy of the Lord. By bringing some conditioned souls back to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, you will get the mercy of the Lord because He is so concerned that the devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and bring as many people as they can with them. This is the wonderful mission of Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's movement, and Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da has arranged ISKCON in such a fantastic way, so that anyone who contacts ISKCON will get the opportunity to go back home, back to Godhead.

Please distribute these books and preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement like anything! Don't sit around in the temple all day!
