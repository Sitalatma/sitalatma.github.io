Vegetarianism of Rama</p>

<p class="comment">Lakshmana&#39;s killing, dressing of birds and fishes, 
and Rama&#39;s munching them - is a heatedly debated topic in web forums of all sorts. Some commentators 
of Ramayana have totally contrived the above expressions, to give a touch of vegetarianism. Even when 
Rama killed Rohi animals as offerings to dead Jatāyu, there also it is contrived to mean as some roots 
or tubers. When Seetha says to Ravana who came in the guise of Brahman friar, that Rama will fetch much 
meat and I offer that on cooking <em>āmiṣam ādāti puṣkalam</em> This also is 
contrived as some tubers and fruits.</p>

<p class="comment">This pro-Jain, pro-Buddhist touch of vegetarianism 
is an enforced virtue on Vedic-ism. The only and real vegetarians of India are the Jains, and Jainism 
is a &#39;holier than thou...&#39; sect of Vedic-ism, for their hymns and <em>bīja akshara-s</em> 
are nothing but the derivatives of Vedic hymns. But these are a fed up lot with the then overtures of 
the practisers of Vedic-ism, and cleaved themselves from Vedic-ism to form Jainism, and even today they 
stick to their principles of non-violence, even towards the tiniest ant. Then came this Buddhism, a 
&#39;peaceable than thou...&#39; sect of the Vedic-ism, for their <em>jātaka katha-s</em> 
and other teachings are nothing but the Vedic lore. This ism, though called a peaceable one, meaning 
&#39;unwarlike...&#39; has conducted many wars and is splintered manifoldly, only because of the overtures of 
its practisers, allowed by their patronising kings. There used to be another sect
<em>cār vāka-s</em> an &#39;intellectual than thou...&#39; sect, but they are termed as 
nihilists atheists, non-believers etc., and their literature is totally ruined as they used to colloid 
with theists, demanding to prove god, materialistically. These are highly sophisticated, well-versed 
in all Veda-s, debaters with utmost precision. These three ism are not called separate religions than 
Vedic-ism, but <em>a vaidika mata-s</em> where <em>mata</em> 
is not a religion, but a philosophy, viewpoint, a <em>darshana</em>.</p>

<p class="comment">Any religion, sect, or a following when patronised 
by the local sovereign, acquires bullhorns and snake fangs and starts to invade others, keeping themselves 
under the shade of their patronising king. So is this Buddhism, and it attained its &#39;warlike&#39; tarnish 
by the swordsmanship of Ashoka, the Great. Besides spoiling its own original and peaceable tenets, Buddhism 
has equally spoiled the Vedic-ism, by the time of Ashoka itself. Even Ashoka has not converted himself 
to Buddhism overnight, but after a series of studies. He was a Buddhist before Kalinga war, but warred 
and massacred Kalinga, and a Buddhist and butchery - does not go hand in hand. By the way, Buddhists 
are no vegetarians, including Ashoka, but his edicts ask all others to not to eat meat.</p>

<p class="comment">Even today verifiable are the dietary habits in 
the provinces where the preachers of Buddhism have gone or not sent, or rendered useless, say Bengal. 
The usual route of Buddhists of Ashoka&#39;s period is from Patna to Orissa, and to Andhra. And Andhra was 
stronghold of Buddhists, once when <em>ācārya nāgarjuna</em> was there, who established 
a Buddhist University in Andhra, to which students from far Japan used to come. Even today, excavations 
are going on and Buddhist edicts are coming out, around Nāgarjuna Sagar dam. The other route from Andhra 
is to Sri Lanka, down south. The details about the itinerary of these Buddhists preachers, better call 
them as door-to-door campaigners of Ashoka&#39;s, greatness than Buddhism, can be found in their legend, 
the third <em>sangītini,</em> masterminded by the mentor of Ashoka, namely
<em>moggali puttastha vira,</em> , someone like Gobbels of Hitler. And rampant was 
this pseudo-Buddhism in South India, much abetted by the then pseudo-Jainism, to where
<em>bhadra sālastha vīra</em> was sent on his way to <em>mahā 
tāmra parṇi dvīpa</em> present day Sri Lanka, headed by Ashoka&#39;s son ṃahinda [ṃahendra, and along 
with the sister of Ashoka,] besides, his <em>dūta-s</em> to the court Antiocus 
II Theos [grandson of Seleucus,] Ptolemy II Philadeliphus, King of Egypt; King Antigonus Gonatus of 
ṃacedon; King Alexander of Epirus... so on. Thus, they successfully propagated about Ashoka, rather 
than the tenets of pure Buddhism, and as a result, that Buddhism is corrupted, back home.</p>

<p class="comment">Though Buddha said at his last stage
<em>vaya dhamma sankara - appamadena sampadeta</em> &#39;decay is an innate feature 
in all beings, acquire your salvation unfalteringly...&#39; where <em>appamādena</em> 
is <em>a pramādena</em> &#39;without, carelessness...&#39; But the later time overenthusiastic 
practisers decayed Buddhism carefully and unfalteringly in its homeland. In these times of Ashoka, the 
customs and habits of Vedic-ism merged into the then pseudo-Buddhism, and a commixture of Vedic-ism 
and pseudo-Buddhism resurfaced, and Vedic-ism became pseudomorphic Brahmanism. Along with it, the dietary 
habits have changed completely, and vegetarianism of Jainism has come to stay, and thereafter it just 
turned to egg-tarianism, and presently going on to hamburger-ism and pizza-ism.</p>

<p class="comment">This being so, the orthodox Hinduism lays taboo 
on meat eating in respect of Brahmans only, that too by reckoning the eras, the Indian
<em>yuga</em> theory. In <em>satya yuga</em> no distinctions 
recorded, in <em>treat yuga, dwāpara yuga-s</em> of Ramayana and Bharata times, 
Brahmins are permitted only some non-veg items, called <em>prokshita āhāra</em> 
as can be seen in Rama-Vali conversation, and sage Agastya bans ram&#39;s meat, that too only for Brahmins, 
after Vātāpi-Ilvala episode. In <em>kali yuga</em> non-veg is completely banned 
for Brahmins, not by scriptures, but by the impact of the then despots of pseudo-Buddhism. The
<em>kali puruṣa</em> is entered through Duryodhana in <em>dwāpara 
yuga</em> of ṃaha Bharata time, but somehow world is saved by Krishna and Arjuna. Now we with a sarcastic 
affection call that <em>kali</em> has entered through Ashoka, and
<em>kali yuga</em> is the period dating from Ashoka&#39;s despotic days. When a state 
of topsy-turviness occurs to Veda-s themselves in <em>kali yuga</em> , where Veda-s 
are breathing their last at present, there is nothing to speak of dietary habits of those eras.</p>

<p class="comment">There are many web pages saying or objecting that 
Rama is a practiser of <em>a himsa</em> not non-violence of Jains, but non-butchery 
of living beings. Valmiki never said that Rama is a <em>Buddhist ṃonk</em> or a
<em>vardhamāna, tīrthankara</em> of Jainism, but depicted him as Hindu Kshatriya, 
and no taboo is prescribed to this warring class in eating meat or chicken. Yet the lamentation will 
be like this: &quot;Lord Rama, a great, divine exemplar of dharma and virtue for Hindus, himself apparently 
doesn&#39;t care much for vegetarianism and ahimsa...&quot; &quot;[Rama:] &#39;I must to lonely wilds repair, abstain 
from flesh, and living there on roots, fruit, honey, hermit&#39;s food, pass twice seven years (14 yrs.) 
in solitude. To Bharata&#39;s hand the king will yield the regent power I thought to wield, and me, a hermit, 
will he send my days in Dandak wood to spend.&#39; &quot; -- Ramayana 2:20. [Griffith, Ralph T.H. The Ramayana 
of Valmiki: translated into English verse. Benares: E.J. Lazarus &amp; Co., 1895. p.117]. It may please 
be noted that vegetarianism is different from non-violence and it belongs only to Jain tenets, and later 
to Gandhian principles, but not to Hindus or Buddhists. The meaning of the above verse is &#39;being a hermit 
I will abstain from food that inculcates <em>rājasa, tāmasa pravṛitti</em> an 
aggressive, assaulting mood... where certain kinds of meat stuff cause an aggressive mood...&#39; and Griffith 
had his own metrical exigencies to incorporate all the subtexts and underlined meanings in those iambics. 
It is unclear as to why hairs are counted on eggshells, without grasping the essence of the epic&#39;s idea 
of eliminating vice, where vice is Ravana and his diabolic activities. Rama&#39;s character may not be taken 
as a meek, weak, bleak backbencher, but take it as a blitzkrieg assaulter, aggressive invader, that 
too only on vice. If he were not to kill an edible animal how can he create a holocaustic extirpator 
of demons in the last episodes of the epic, or shall he start chanting on battlefield
<em>dhammam sharaṇam gaccāmi, sangam sharaṇam gaccami</em> that too, to Ravana 
- needs to be explored. Firstly let us ask ourselves whether we want a Ravana or a Rama, whether they 
eat meat, chicken 65, or <em>biryāni</em>, or Italian ice creams.</p>

<p class="comment">Whether Rama is a god or no god, he is the princely 
Kshatriya, and if a warrior Kshatriya subsists on tubers and fruits, and on other insipid food, we can 
imagine how grand his warfare would be. If Rama were to be a god, why God created a big fish that eats 
a small fish, why birds and animals of prey, and why a <em>niṣāda</em> that kills 
a bird at the start of Ramayana. Hence, taking dietary habits as acquired habits, but not godsend or 
tabooed ordinances of scriptures, the meanings of these verses of Kabandha are not contrived to establish 
any vegetarianism. Incidentally, these are the advices of raw-flesh eating Kabandha and we do not see 
Rama feasting comfortably on birds, fish, or on Kentucky chicken, at Pampa.</p>
