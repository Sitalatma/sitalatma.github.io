<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
The Legend of Shunashepa is commenced and Sage Shatānanda continues this as a part 
of Vishvamitra&#39;s legend. When Rama&#39;s grandparent Ambarīsha undertook a ritual, 
Indra impounds that ritual&#39;s horse. Then Ambarīsha had to fetch a human-animal 
in lieu of that lost horse. When none is available one named Shunashepa, son of 
Sage Ricīka, and a nephew of Vishvamitra, offers himself with a barter of riches 
to his parents.</p>

<p class="comment">
The wife of the Sage Rucīka is Satyavathi, the sister of Vishvamitra whose legend 
was narrated by Vishvamitra in Bala ch. 34. This longing for youngest sons by a 
mother is reflected in ṃaha Bharata, where Kunti pleads for leaving Sahadeva, the 
youngest Pandava, from going to forest exile, along with her in the city. In <em>
sabhā parva</em> she says: <em>sabhā parvāṇi sahadevam prati kuntī vākyam - sahadeva nivartasva nanu tvam 
asi me priyaḥ | sharīrāt api mādreya māmatyakṣhīḥ kuputravat | - āshrama vāse 
dharma putram prati kuntī vākyam - sahadeva mārāja mā pramādam kṛithā | 
- dk</em> Kunti, the mother of Pandava-s says: &#39;oh, Sahadeva, you refrain 
from going on exile as you are a dear son of mine, though ṃādri gave you a bodily 
birth, you are my favourite...&#39; Also, in the period of forest exile she says to 
Yudhishtar: &#39;oh, king, let no danger occur to Sahadeva... as he is my cherished 
son...&#39;</p>
