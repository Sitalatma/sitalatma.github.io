Nevertheless, by the purifying effect of the association of devotees they may all achieve the supreme abode of the Personality of Godhead, whereas without such saintly association, even those very seriously endeavoring in <i>yoga,</i> Sāṅkhya study, charity, vows and practice of the renounced order of life may remain incapable of attaining the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>

The young women of Vṛndāvana displayed such deep attachment to Lord Kṛṣṇa that their minds, which were overflowing with the ecstasy of being with Him, perceived an entire night spent in His company as just a fraction of a second. However, when Akrūra took Śrī Kṛṣṇa along with Baladeva to Mathurā, the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> then thought each night without Him to be equal in duration to a millennium of the demigods.

        Purport
    </h2>
    

        <div id="bb79674" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The commentary of Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī on these two verses can be summarized as follows. One may serve the devotees of the Lord by assisting them or by having their personal association. Association with pure devotees is sufficient for self-realization because one can learn everything about spiritual advancement from such devotees. With perfect knowledge one can achieve all that one desires, for the process of devotional service immediately brings the blessings of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pure devotional service is transcendental to the modes of nature, and therefore it appears mysterious to the souls conditioned by those modes.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79675" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa stated, <i>haviṣāgnau yajeta mām: - <span style="color:#990012">หวิษาคฺนะอุ ยเชต มามฺ:</span></i> “One may worship Me in fire by offering oblations of ghee.” (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 11.11.43) Also, in verse 38 of the previous chapter it was mentioned that one should construct parks, recreational places, orchards, vegetable gardens, and so on. These serve to attract people to the temples of Kṛṣṇa, where they may directly engage in chanting the holy name of the Lord. Such construction projects may be understood as <i>pūrtam, - <span style="color:#990012">ปูรฺตมฺ,</span></i> or public welfare activities. Although Lord Kṛṣṇa mentions in these two verses that association with His pure devotees is far more powerful than processes such as <i>yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">โยค,</span></i> philosophical speculation, sacrifices and public welfare activities, these secondary activities also please Lord Kṛṣṇa, but to a lesser extent. Specifically, they please the Lord when performed by devotees rather than by ordinary materialistic persons. Therefore the comparative term <i>yathā - <span style="color:#990012">ยตฺหา</span></i> (“according to proportion”) is used. In other words, such practices as sacrifice, austerity and philosophical study may help one become fit for rendering devotional service, and when such activities are performed by devotees aspiring for spiritual advancement, they become somewhat pleasing to the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79676" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>One may study the example of <i>vratāni, - <span style="color:#990012">วฺรตานิ,</span></i> or vows. The injunction that one should fast on Ekādaśī is a permanent vow for all Vaiṣṇavas, and one should not conclude from these verses that one may neglect the Ekādaśī vow. The superiority of <i>sat-saṅga, - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ-สงฺค,</span></i> or association with pure devotees, in awarding the fruit of love of Godhead does not mean that one should give up other processes or that these secondary processes are not permanent factors in <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> There are many Vedic injunctions instructing one to execute the <i>agnihotra - <span style="color:#990012">อคฺนิโหตฺร</span></i> sacrifice, and the modern-day followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu also occasionally execute fire sacrifices. Such sacrifice is recommended by the Lord Himself in the previous chapter, and therefore it should not be given up by the devotees of the Lord. By performing Vedic ritualistic and purificatory processes, one is gradually elevated to the platform of devotional service, whereupon one is able to directly worship the Absolute Truth. One Vedic injunction states, “The result awarded for fasting continuously for one month on six different occasions can easily be achieved simply by accepting a handful of rice offered to Lord Viṣṇu. This facility is especially offered in the Kali-yuga.” Nevertheless, regulated fasting on Ekādaśī is not an impediment to spiritual advancement. Rather, it is a perpetual aspect of devotional service and can be considered an auxiliary principle supporting the main principle of worshiping Lord Kṛṣṇa and His devotees. Because such secondary principles help one become fit for executing the primary processes of devotional service, they are also greatly beneficial. Therefore, such secondary principles are widely mentioned throughout Vedic literature. It may be concluded that such secondary principles are essential for advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore one should never give up the principle of <i>vrata, - <span style="color:#990012">วฺรต,</span></i> the execution of prescribed vows.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79677" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous chapter Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī mentioned that the words <i>ājñāyaivaṁ guṇān doṣān - <span style="color:#990012">อาชฺญาไยวํ คุณานฺ โทษานฺ</span></i> (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 11.11.32) indicate that a devotee should select Vedic principles that do not conflict with his service to the Lord. Many of the elaborate Vedic ceremonies and complicated procedures for fasting, demigod worship and <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> practice cause great disturbance to the supreme process of <i>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณํ กีรฺตนํ วิโษฺณฮ,</span></i> hearing and chanting about the Lord; therefore they are rejected by the Vaiṣṇavas. However, the processes helpful to devotional service should be accepted. The example can be given of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, who was instructed by the dying Bhīṣmadeva. In <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.9.27) Bhīṣma instructs King Yudhiṣṭhira in <i>dāna-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ทาน-ธรฺม,</span></i> or public acts of charity, <i>rāja-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ราช-ธรฺม,</span></i> or the duties of a king, <i>mokṣa-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">โมกฺษ-ธรฺม,</span></i> or duties for salvation, <i>strī-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">สฺตฺรี-ธรฺม,</span></i> or duties for women, and ultimately <i>bhāgavata-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span></i> or pure devotional service to the Lord. Bhīṣma did not limit his discussion to <i>bhāgavata-dharma,</i> because Lord Kṛṣṇa gave Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira the devotional service of acting as a king, and to execute his service Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja required extensive knowledge of civic affairs. However, one who is not rendering such prescribed devotional service in society should not unnecessarily involve himself in the material world, even by practice of Vedic rituals. Nothing should distract him from the ultimate goal of satisfying Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79678" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The principle of not giving up prescribed vows may be further illustrated by the example of Mahārāja Ambarīṣa. In the Ninth Canto of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> we find that although Mahārāja Ambarīṣa performed elaborate Vedic sacrifices, his goal was always the satisfaction of the Lord. The citizens in his kingdom did not desire to go to heaven, because they were always hearing about the glories of Vaikuṇṭha. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, along with his queen, observed the vow of Ekādaśī and Dvādaśī for one year. Since Ambarīṣa Mahārāja is considered to be a great jewel among Vaiṣṇavas, and since his behavior was always exemplary, it is definitely concluded that such vows as fasting on Ekādaśī are imperative for Vaiṣṇavas. It is further stated in Vedic literature, “If due to negligence a Vaiṣṇava does not fast on Ekādaśī, then his worship of Lord Viṣṇu is useless, and he will go to hell.” The members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness fast from grains and beans on Ekādaśī, and this vow should always be observed by all of its members.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79679" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>If one falsely thinks that one may obtain the association of Lord Kṛṣṇa merely by great austerities, brilliant studies in Sanskrit literature, magnanimous acts of charity, etc., one’s Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be distorted and weakened. One should remember the example of Lord Caitanya, who practiced Kṛṣṇa consciousness by constantly hearing and chanting about Lord Kṛṣṇa. If by fasting, study, austerity or sacrifice one becomes more fit to participate in the <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement of Lord Caitanya, then such activities are also pleasing to Lord Kṛṣṇa. But the Lord clearly explains here that such activities can never become central in the practice of <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> They must remain in an auxiliary relationship to the supreme process of <i>sat-saṅga, - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ-สงฺค,</span></i> or association with pure devotees who hear and chant the glories of the Lord. Śrīla Madhvācārya has quoted from Vedic literature that if one offends the Lord’s devotees and does not learn to associate with them, Lord Viṣṇu personally places barriers in the path of such a person so that he may not enter into the Lord’s company.</p></div>

It is understood that devotees like the <i>gopīs</i> and others mentioned here obtained pure love of Kṛṣṇa, whereas the demons generally obtained only salvation. Many demons were purified by association with devotees and came to accept devotional service to the Lord as the most important among the various activities in their lives, but the exalted devotees like Prahlāda and Bali Mahārāja know nothing except devotional service, which they accept as their very life. Still, the reformed demons are also mentioned so that readers of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> will understand the enormous benefits one may achieve by associating with devotees of the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79688" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The demon Vṛtrāsura was the pious King Citraketu in his previous life, during which he associated with Śrī Nārada Muni, Śrī Aṅgirā Muni and Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. Prahlāda Mahārāja, being the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, is considered a Daitya, or demon. Yet while still in the womb of his mother, Kayādhū, he associated with Nārada Muni by sound vibration. The demon Vṛṣaparvā was abandoned by his mother at birth, but he was raised by a <i>muni - <span style="color:#990012">มุนิ</span></i> and became a devotee of Lord Viṣṇu. Bali Mahārāja associated with his grandfather Prahlāda and also with Lord Vāmanadeva. Bali Mahārāja’s son, Bāṇāsura, was saved by association with his father and Lord Śiva. He also associated with Lord Kṛṣṇa personally when the Lord cut off all but two of his one thousand arms, which had been awarded as a benediction by Lord Śiva. Understanding the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Bāṇāsura also became a great devotee. The demon Maya Dānava constructed an assembly house for the Pāṇḍavas and also associated with Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, eventually achieving the shelter of the Lord. Vibhīṣaṇa was a pious-natured demon, the brother of Rāvaṇa, and he associated with Hanumān and Rāmacandra.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79689" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Sugrīva, Hanumān, Jāmbavān and Gajendra are examples of animals who achieved the mercy of the Lord. Jāmbavān, or Ṛkṣarāja, was a member of a race of bears. He personally associated with Lord Kṛṣṇa, fighting with Him over the Syamantaka jewel. The elephant Gajendra in a previous life had association with devotees, and at the end of his life as Gajendra he was personally saved by the Lord. Jaṭāyu, the bird who at the cost of his own life assisted Lord Rāmacandra, associated with Śrī Garuḍa and Mahārāja Daśaratha as well as other devotees in <i>rāma-līlā. - <span style="color:#990012">ราม-ลีลา.</span></i> He also personally met with Sītā and Lord Rāma. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the association that the Gandharvas, Apsarās, Nāgas, Siddhas, Cāraṇas, Guhyakas and Vidyādharas had with the devotees is not very prominent and does not need to be mentioned. Vaṇikpatha is a <i>vaiśya, - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺย,</span></i> and his story is mentioned in the <i>Mahābhārata - <span style="color:#990012">มหาภารต</span></i> in connection with the pride of Jājali Muni.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79690" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The importance of association with devotees is illustrated in the story of Dharma-vyādha, the nonviolent hunter, as described in the <i>Varāha Purāṇa. - <span style="color:#990012">วราห ปุราณ.</span></i> In a previous life he somehow became a <i>brahma-rākṣasa, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-รากฺษส,</span></i> or <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> ghost, but was eventually saved. In a previous Kali-yuga he had the association of a Vaiṣṇava king named Vāsu. The lady Kubjā associated directly with Lord Kṛṣṇa, and in her previous birth she had associated with Śrī Nārada Muni.

Having had ample association with devotees, they became <i>gopīs</i> in Vṛndāvana in their next lives and associated with the eternally liberated <i>gopīs</i> who had descended there. They also had association with Tulasī-devī, or Vṛndādevī. The wives of the <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> performing sacrifice had association with women sent by Lord Kṛṣṇa to sell flower garlands and betel nuts and heard about the Lord from them.</p></div>

Snakes like Kāliya also developed this love in servitude, and after relishing their loving service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, all of them went back home, back to Godhead.

In fact, the <i>gopīs</i> did not think about their own existence. Although a young woman normally considers her husband and children to be her dearmost possessions, the <i>gopīs</i> did not even consider the existence of their so-called families. Nor could they think of this world or life after death. Indeed, they were not at all aware of these things. Just like great sages who become detached from the names and forms of the material world, the <i>gopīs</i> could not think of anything, because they were rapt in loving remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Just as rivers enter the ocean, similarly, the <i>gopīs</i> completely merged into consciousness of Lord Kṛṣṇa through intense love.”</p></div>

        <div id="bb79726" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The words <i>svam ātmānam adas tathedam - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวมฺ อาตฺมานมฺ อทสฺ เตตฺหทมฺ</span></i> indicate that while for ordinary persons one’s personal body is the most near and dear thing, the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> considered their own bodies to be distant and remote, just as a <i>yogī - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี</span></i> in <i>samādhi - <span style="color:#990012">สมาธิ</span></i> trance considers ordinary things around his physical body or his physical body itself to be most remote. When Kṛṣṇa played on His flute late at night, the <i>gopīs</i> immediately forgot everything about their so-called husbands and children and went to dance with Lord Kṛṣṇa in the forest. These controversial points have been clearly explained in the book <i>Kṛṣṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ,</span></i> by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. The basic explanation is that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the source of everything, and the <i>gopīs</i> are the Lord’s own potency. Thus there is no discrepancy or immorality in the almighty Personality of Godhead’s loving affairs with His own manifest potency, the <i>gopīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ,</span></i> who happen to be the most beautiful young girls in the creation of God.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79727" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There is no illusion on the part of the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ,</span></i> for they are so attracted to Lord Kṛṣṇa that they do not care to think of anything else. Since all existence is situated within the body of Lord Kṛṣṇa, there is no loss for the <i>gopīs</i> when they concentrate on the Lord. It is the nature of very deep love to exclude all objects except the beloved. However, in the material world, where we try to love a limited temporary object such as our nation, family or personal body, our exclusion of other objects constitutes ignorance. But when our love is intensely concentrated on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the origin of everything, such concentration cannot be considered ignorance or small-mindedness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79728" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The example of the sages in <i>samādhi - <span style="color:#990012">สมาธิ</span></i> is given here only to illustrate exclusive concentration on a single object. Otherwise, there is no comparison between the ecstatic love of the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> and the dry meditation of the <i>yogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ,</span></i> who merely try to understand that they are not their material bodies. Since the <i>gopīs</i> had no material bodies to become detached from and were personally dancing with and embracing the Absolute Truth, one can never compare the exalted position of the <i>gopīs</i> to that of mere <i>yogīs. - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ.</span></i> It is stated that the bliss of impersonal Brahman realization cannot be compared to even an atomic fragment of the blissful ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa. Intimate attachment is like a strong rope that binds the mind and heart. In material life we are bound to that which is temporary and illusory, and therefore such binding of the heart causes great pain. However, if we bind our minds and hearts to the eternal Lord Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of all pleasure and beauty, then our hearts will expand unlimitedly in the ocean of transcendental bliss.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79729" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>One should understand that the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> were not in any way inclined toward impersonal meditation, in which one denies the reality of variegated creation. The <i>gopīs</i> did not deny anything; they simply loved Kṛṣṇa and could not think of anything else. They only rejected whatever impeded their concentration on Lord Kṛṣṇa, cursing even their own eyelids, which blinked and thus removed Kṛṣṇa from their sight for a split second. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has stated that all sincere devotees of the Lord should have the courage to remove from their lives anything that impedes their progressive march back home, back to Godhead.</p></div>

Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains this and other meanings of the word <i>asvarūpa-vidaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">อสฺวรูป-วิทฮ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อสฺวรูป-วิทฮ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">อสฺวรูป-วิทฮ.</span></i> In Sanskrit the word <i>vid</i> also means “to acquire.” Thus, <i>asvarūpa-vidaḥ</i> indicates that the <i>gopīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ,</span></i> like other pure devotees of the Lord, were not interested in achieving <i>sārūpya-mukti, - <span style="color:#990012">สารูปฺย-มุกฺติ,</span></i> the liberation of acquiring a bodily form similar to the Lord’s.

Since the <i>gopīs</i> had realized their eternal spiritual forms as servitors of the Lord, the word <i>svarūpa</i> also may indicate their own spiritual bodies, and thus <i>asvarūpa-vidaḥ</i> means that the <i>gopīs</i> never thought, as materialists do, of their own bodily beauty. Although the <i>gopīs</i> are the most beautiful girls in the Lord’s creation, they never thought of their own bodies but rather were always meditating on the transcendental body of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

        <div id="bb79740" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrī Uddhava inquired from Lord Kṛṣṇa about the symptoms of saintly persons and liberated souls, and the Lord has replied in terms of different levels of spiritual advancement, distinguishing between those who are able to understand Lord Kṛṣṇa to be the principal goal of life and those loving devotees who accept Lord Kṛṣṇa and devotional service to Him as the only goal of life. Lord Kṛṣṇa also mentioned that He is captured by His loving devotees and even by those who sincerely associate with His loving devotees. Among all the devotees, the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> of Vṛndāvana were described by the Lord as having achieved such a rare state of pure devotional service that Lord Kṛṣṇa personally feels constantly indebted to them. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Lord Kṛṣṇa previously kept the <i>gopīs’ - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ′</span></i> love for Him concealed in His heart because of its confidential nature and the Lord’s own gravity. Finally, however, even Lord Kṛṣṇa could not remain silent about the intense love of the <i>gopīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ,</span></i> and thus in these verses the Lord reveals to Uddhava how the <i>gopīs</i> loved Him in Vṛndāvana and brought Him fully under their control. The Lord would relax in secret places with the loving <i>gopīs,</i> and by conjugal spontaneous affection the greatest love was exchanged between them.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79741" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As explained by the Lord in <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> one cannot achieve the perfection of life merely by renouncing the material world or by executing ordinary, sectarian religious principles. One must actually understand the identity of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and by associating with His pure devotees one must learn to love the Lord in His personal, original form. This love may be expressed in either the conjugal, parental, fraternal or serving <i>rasa, - <span style="color:#990012">รส,</span></i> or relationship. The Lord has elaborately explained to Uddhava the system of philosophical analysis of the material world, and now He clearly concludes that it is useless for Uddhava to waste time in fruitive activities or mental speculation. Actually, Lord Kṛṣṇa is hinting that Uddhava should assimilate the example of the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> and try to advance further in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by following in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja. Any conditioned soul who is unsatisfied with the cruel laws of nature, which impose disease, old age and death, should understand that Lord Kṛṣṇa can deliver all living beings from the problems of material existence. There is no need to entangle oneself in unauthorized, sectarian rituals, injunctions or prohibitions. One should simply surrender to Lord Kṛṣṇa, following the example of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. By the authorized regulated process of <i>bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one easily achieves spiritual perfection.</p></div>

Uddhava interpreted this statement as recommending <i>karma-miśrā bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-มิศฺรา ภกฺติ,</span></i> or devotional service mixed with a tendency toward fruitive activities. It is a fact that until one understands Lord Kṛṣṇa to be everything, it is not possible to retire from ordinary, worldly duties. Rather, one is encouraged to offer the fruits of such work to the Lord. In verse 4 of the Tenth Chapter, the Lord recommended that one retire from worldly duties and systematically cultivate knowledge, accepting Him as the Supreme. Uddhava understood this instruction to indicate <i>jñāna-miśrā bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-มิศฺรา ภกฺติ,</span></i> or devotional service to the Lord mixed with the secondary desire to accumulate knowledge. Beginning with verse 35 of the Tenth Chapter, Uddhava inquired about the process of material conditioning and liberation from material life. The Lord replied elaborately, stating that without devotional service the process of philosophical speculation can never be perfected. In Chapter Eleven, verse 18, the Lord emphasized the importance of faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and in verse 23 Kṛṣṇa extensively widened His discussion of devotional service, emphasizing that one should be faithful and hear and chant the glories of the Lord. The Lord concluded that both the development and perfection of devotional service depend on association with the devotees. In verse 26 of the Eleventh Chapter, Uddhava inquired about the actual ways and means of devotional service and about the symptoms of devotional perfection. And in verse 48 Lord Kṛṣṇa stated that unless one takes to the process of devotional service, one’s attempt for liberation will be useless. One must associate with the devotees of the Lord and follow in their footsteps. Finally, in verse 14 of this chapter the Lord categorically rejected the paths of fruitive activities and mental speculation and in verse 15 recommended that one exclusively surrender unto Him with all one’s heart.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79747" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Having received such elaborate and technical instructions on the perfection of life, Uddhava is bewildered, and his mind is afflicted with doubt about what he should actually do. Lord Kṛṣṇa has described many procedures and the results of such procedures, all of which ultimately lead to the single goal of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Uddhava therefore desires that Lord Kṛṣṇa state in simple terms what should be done. Arjuna makes a similar request of the Lord at the beginning of the Third Chapter of <i>Bhagavad-gītā. - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา.</span></i> According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Uddhava is stating here, “My dear friend Kṛṣṇa, first You recommended that I perform worldly activities within the <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span></i> system, and then You advised that I reject such activities and take to the path of philosophical research. Now rejecting the path of <i>jñāna, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน,</span></i> You recommend that I simply surrender unto You in <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> If I accept Your decision, in the future You may again go back to Your original point and recommend worldly activities.” By his boldness in disclosing his mind, Uddhava reveals his intimate friendship with Lord Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>

Uddhava was bewildered and doubtful because Lord Kṛṣṇa explained many different processes such as devotional service, speculative knowledge, renunciation, mystic <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">โยค,</span></i> austerities, pious duties, and so on. However, all of these processes are meant to help the living entities obtain the shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and ultimately no Vedic process should be understood in any other way. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa explained the entire Vedic system, placing everything in proper order. In fact, Lord Kṛṣṇa was surprised that Uddhava foolishly thought that he was meant to practice every process, as if each method were meant simply for him. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore wants to inform His devotee, “My dear Uddhava, when I told you that analytic knowledge is to be practiced, pious duties are to be performed, devotional service is obligatory, <i>yoga</i> procedures must be observed, austerities are to be executed, etc., I was instructing all living entities, using you as My immediate audience. That which I have spoken, am speaking now and will speak in the future should be understood as guidance for all living entities in different situations. How could you possibly think that you were meant to practice all of the different Vedic processes? I accept you as you are now, My pure devotee. You are not supposed to execute all of these processes.” Thus according to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the Lord, with lighthearted and encouraging words, reveals to Uddhava the deep purpose behind the variety of Vedic procedures.</p></div>

The word <i>ghoṣeṇa - <span style="color:#990012">โฆเษณ</span></i> means “subtle sound,” and <i>guhāṁ praviṣṭaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">คุหาํ ปฺรวิษฺฏฮ</span></i> also indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa enters within the <i>ādhāra-cakra. - <span style="color:#990012">อาธาร-จกฺร.</span></i> The Lord can further be perceived within other <i>cakras</i> such as the <i>maṇipūraka-cakra, - <span style="color:#990012">มณิปูรก-จกฺร,</span></i> located around the navel, and the <i>viśuddhi-cakra. - <span style="color:#990012">วิศุทฺธิ-จกฺร.</span></i> The Sanskrit alphabet is composed of short and long vowels, and consonants pronounced with high and low tones, and utilizing these vibrations the different branches of Vedic literatures are manifested as a gross form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> such literatures deal mostly with the three modes of material nature: <i>traiguṇya-viṣayā vedā nistrai-guṇyo bhavārjuna. - <span style="color:#990012">ไตฺรคุณฺย-วิษยา เวทา นิไสฺตฺร-คุโณฺย ภวารฺชุน.</span></i> Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī explains that due to the control of the illusory energy, <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> the Personality of Godhead appears to the conditioned souls as part of the material universe. The imagined imposition of gross and subtle material qualities on the Personality of Godhead is called <i>avidyā, - <span style="color:#990012">อวิทฺยา,</span></i> or ignorance, and through such ignorance the living entity considers himself to be the doer of his own activities and becomes bound up in the network of <i>karma. - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม.</span></i> The <i>Vedas</i> therefore order an entangled soul to observe positive and negative injunctions to purify his existence. These procedures are called <i>pravṛtti-mārga, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรวฺฤตฺติ-มารฺค,</span></i> or the path of regulated fruitive activities. When one has purified one’s existence, one gives up this gross stage of fruitive activities because it is detrimental to the practice of pure devotional service. By firm faith one may then worship the Personality of Godhead. One who has developed perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness no longer has to perform ritualistic duties. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā,</i> <i>tasya kāryaṁ na vidyate. - <span style="color:#990012">ตสฺย การฺยํ น วิทฺยเต.</span></i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79754" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, this verse may be understood in another way. The word <i>jīva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span></i> indicates Lord Kṛṣṇa, who gives life to the residents of Vṛndāvana, and <i>vivara-prasūti - <span style="color:#990012">วิวร-ปฺรสูติ</span></i> indicates that although Lord Kṛṣṇa eternally performs His pastimes in the spiritual world, beyond the vision of the conditioned souls, He also enters within the material universe to display these same pastimes. The words <i>guhāṁ praviṣṭaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">คุหาํ ปฺรวิษฺฏฮ</span></i> indicates that after displaying such pastimes, the Lord withdraws them and enters into His unmanifest pastimes, or those pastimes not manifest to the conditioned souls. In this case, <i>mātrā - <span style="color:#990012">มาตฺรา</span></i> indicates the transcendental senses of the Lord, <i>svara - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวร</span></i> indicates the Lord’s transcendental sound vibration and singing, and the word <i>varṇa - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณ</span></i> indicates the transcendental form of the Lord. The word <i>sthaviṣṭha, - <span style="color:#990012">สฺตฺหวิษฺฐ,</span></i> or “gross manifestation,” means that the Lord becomes manifest in the material world even to those devotees who are not completely advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and whose vision is not completely purified. <i>Mano-maya - <span style="color:#990012">มโน-มย</span></i> indicates that somehow or other Lord Kṛṣṇa is to be kept within one’s mind; and for the nondevotees Lord Kṛṣṇa is <i>sūkṣma, - <span style="color:#990012">สูกฺษฺม,</span></i> or most subtle, because He cannot be known. Thus different <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> have glorified Lord Kṛṣṇa in different ways through the transcendental sound vibration of this verse.</p></div>

        <div id="bb79759" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Kṛṣṇa here explains the most confidential meaning of Vedic knowledge. The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> first regulate ordinary material work and channel the fruits into ritualistic sacrifices, which ostensibly reward the performer with future benefits. The real purpose of these sacrifices, however, is to accustom a materialistic worker to offering the fruits of his work to a superior Vedic authority. An expert fruitive worker gradually exhausts the possibilities of material enjoyment and naturally gravitates toward the superior stage of philosophical speculation on his existential situation. By increased knowledge, one becomes aware of the unlimited glories of the Supreme and gradually takes to the process of loving devotional service to the transcendental Absolute Truth. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the goal of Vedic knowledge, as the Lord states in <i>Bhagavad-gītā: - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา:</span></i> <i>vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">เวไทศฺ จ สไรฺวรฺ อหมฺ เอว เวทฺยฮ.</span></i> The Lord gradually becomes manifest in the progression of Vedic rituals, just as fire is gradually manifest by the rubbing of firewood. The words <i>haviṣā samedhate - <span style="color:#990012">หวิษา สเมธเต</span></i> (“the fire increases by addition of ghee”) indicate that by the progressive advancement of Vedic sacrifice, the fire of spiritual knowledge gradually blazes, illuminating everything and destroying the chain of fruitive work.</p></div>

The suffix <i>vṛt</i> means the <i>vartanam, - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺตนมฺ,</span></i> or “existence,” of the three modes of material nature within the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Analyzing the term <i>abja - <span style="color:#990012">อพฺช</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ช</span>-yoni, ap - <span style="color:#990012">อพฺช-โยนิ, อปฺ</span></i> indicates “water,” and <i>ja</i> indicates “birth.” Thus <i>abja</i> means the complex material universe, which sprouts from Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who lies in the Garbhodaka Ocean. <i>Yoni, - <span style="color:#990012">โยนิ,</span></i> or “source,” indicates the Personality of Godhead, and thus <i>abja-yoni - <span style="color:#990012">อพฺช-โยนิ</span></i> means that the Lord is the source of all cosmic manifestations; indeed, all creation takes place within the Lord. Since the three modes of material nature are under the superior control of the Lord, material objects helplessly undergo creation and annihilation within the universal shell by the will of the Lord. The term <i>avyakta - <span style="color:#990012">อวฺยกฺต</span></i> indicates the Lord’s subtle spiritual form, which exists alone before the material creation. The Lord’s original form, being spiritual, does not undergo birth, transformation or death. It is eternal. In the course of time, the Lord’s material potencies are divided and manifest as bodies, bodily paraphernalia, sense objects, bodily expansions, false ego and false proprietorship. Thus the Lord expands His conscious living potency called <i>jīva-śakti, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-ศกฺติ,</span></i> which is manifest in innumerable material forms such as those of men, demigods, animals, and so on. From the example of the seeds sown in an agricultural field, we can understand that innumerable manifestations may arise from a single source. Similarly, although the Lord is one, He becomes manifest in innumerable forms through the expansion of His different potencies.</p></div>

One’s material life may appear to be blossoming, but ultimately there will appear the bitter fruits of old age, death and other catastrophes. Attachment to the material body, which is always inclined toward sense gratification, is the root cause of material existence, and it is therefore called <i>saṁsāra-taru. - <span style="color:#990012">สํสาร-ตรุ.</span></i> The tendency to exploit the external energy of the Supreme Lord has existed since time immemorial, as expressed by the words <i>purāṇaḥ karmātmakaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ปุราณฮ กรฺมาตฺมกฮ.</span></i> The material universe is an expansion of the illusory potency of the Supreme Lord and is always dependent on Him and nondifferent from Him.

        <div id="bb79788" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Because Uddhava had achieved the perfection of personal association with Lord Kṛṣṇa, there was no need for him to maintain the mentality of a conditioned soul, and thus, as described here by the words <i>sampadya cātmānam, - <span style="color:#990012">สมฺปทฺย จาตฺมานมฺ,</span></i> Uddhava could personally serve the lotus feet of the Lord in the spiritual world. Indeed, Uddhava requested this opportunity at the beginning of this great conversation. As stated here, <i>gurūpāsanayaika-bhaktyā: - <span style="color:#990012">คุรูปาสนไยก-ภกฺตฺยา:</span></i> one can achieve pure devotional service by worshiping a bona fide spiritual master. It is not recommended here that one give up pure devotional service or one’s spiritual master. Rather, it is clearly stated by the words <i>vidyā-kuṭhāreṇa - <span style="color:#990012">วิทฺยา-กุฐาเรณ</span></i> that one should cultivate knowledge of the material world as described by Lord Kṛṣṇa in this chapter. One should fully understand that each and every aspect of the material creation is the expansion of the illusory potency of the Lord. Such knowledge works as a sharpened ax to cut down the roots of material existence. In this way, even the stubborn subtle body, created by the three modes of nature, is cut to pieces, and one becomes <i>apramatta, - <span style="color:#990012">อปฺรมตฺต,</span></i> or sane and cautious in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb79789" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Kṛṣṇa has clearly explained in this chapter that the cowherd damsels of Vṛndāvana were not interested in an analytical approach to life. They simply loved Lord Kṛṣṇa and could not think of anything else. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught that all His devotees should follow in the footsteps of the cowherd damsels of Vraja in order to develop the highest intensity of selfless love of Godhead. Lord Kṛṣṇa has elaborately analyzed the nature of the material world so that the conditioned souls, who are trying to enjoy it, can cut down the tree of material existence with this knowledge. The words <i>sampadya cātmānam - <span style="color:#990012">สมฺปทฺย จาตฺมานมฺ</span></i> indicate that a person with such knowledge has no further material existence, because he has already achieved the Personality of Godhead. Such a person should not loiter in the kingdom of <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> perpetually refining his understanding of the illusory creation. One who has accepted Lord Kṛṣṇa as everything may enjoy eternal bliss in the Lord’s service. Yet even though he remains in this world, he has no more business with it and gives up the analytical procedures for negating it. Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore tells Uddhava, <i>tyajāstram: - <span style="color:#990012">ตฺยชาสฺตฺรมฺ:</span></i> “Give up the ax of analytic knowledge by which you have cut down your sense of proprietorship and residence in the material world.”</p></div>
