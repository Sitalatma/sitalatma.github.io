<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama and Lakshmana while safeguarding the ritual of Sage Vishvamitra for six days 
and nights, on the last night demons named ṃāreecha and Subāhu come to hinder 
the ritual. Rama acts deftly and hits out ṃāreecha to a long distance, but kills 
the other, namely Subāhu. Rama thus makes the ritual of sage Vishvamitra a success.</p>

<p class="comment">
It appears from the word order as above, &#39;at which time those two demons are to 
be safeguarded by us?&#39; But positioning the word <em>samrakshṇīyau</em> is a grammarian&#39;s 
headache. On this many kinds of declinations are said. Rama Tilaka attributes this
<em>rakshṇiyau</em> &#39;to be safeguarded&#39; to ritual, and he says that &#39;from whom the 
ritual is to be safeguarded&#39;</p>
