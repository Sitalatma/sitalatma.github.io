<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 30<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Oct 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama and Khara exchange a haughty wordy duel and when the demon Khara charges at Rama, Rama eliminates 
him with his all-powerful arrow and gods and sages shower flowery rain. Seetha and Lakshmana return 
from their hiding cave and Seetha becomes very happy on seeing her victorious and indefatigable husband.</p>

bhittvā tu tām gadām bāṇaiḥ rāghavo dharma vatsalaḥ |<br>smayamānaḥ kharam vākyam saṃrabdham idam abravīt 
|| 3-30-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. dharma vatsalaḥ rāghavaḥ</em> = virtue, patron, Raghava; <em>tām gadām bāṇaiḥ bhittvā</em> 
= that, mace, with arrows, having smashed; <em>smayamānaḥ</em> = while smiling; <em>samrabdham kharam</em> 
= to flustering, Khara; <em>idam vākyam abravīt</em> = this, sentence, spoke.</p>

<p class="tat">
On smashing the mace with arrows Raghava spoke this sentence to Khara smiling him out of temper, without 
assaulting weaponless and flustering Khara, because Rama is the patron of virtue following the protocol 
of righteous war. [3-30-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
This seems to be a roundabout meaning. But to explain why the epithet <em>dharma vatsala</em> to Rama 
is given, this beating round the bush is necessary. So also, many epithets used in this epic have relevance 
to the circumstances, characters, or their actions. These cannot be explained without the support of 
commentaries, and unfortunately commentaries skip these minor details assuming that the readers are 
capable enough to grasp them in the course of narration, which resulted otherwise at a later time. We 
therefore request pundits to consolidate the relevancy of each the inordinate epithet used to the situations 
narrated somewhere like web, if it is going to cost a fortune on printing and stationary. Explaining 
them occasionally is unnoticed, and they appear to be redundant metre fillers in these days where Sanskrit 
itself has become an alienated language.</p>

are hesitatingly consigning oblations into Ritual-Fire, which are to be swiftly dropped into fire to

<p class="comment">
dhvani/allusion: For the above three verses it said: <em>evam bruvāṇam rāmam</em> &#39;to Rama who saying 
that way...&#39; <em>mṛityu vashya kharaḥ</em> &#39;Khara going under the control of Death...&#39; is saying &#39;oh, 
Rama...&#39; <em>tvam vācya a+vācya na budhyase iti</em> &#39;you know not what to speak and what not to speak 
- to a dying creature like me, because that creature&#39;s six-senses are stand-still...&#39; Then why is this
<em>nirbhartsayana, roṣa?</em> &#39;threatening me, and anger at me?&#39; &#39;Because the faculties of that dying 
creatures, presently mine, will be in a flux, they will attack anyone verbally or physically, let alone 
the Almighty... thus you are not able to distinguish between what is to be done or not to be done with 
such a senseless creature... So, what you have to do now is to finish me, and what is not to be done 
is this sermonising. Why not finish me off from this curse and accord salvation?&#39; ṃaheshvara Tīrtha.

<p class="comment">
On this back stepping, backtracking, or the scrape Rama took in war, [ scrape - intr. draw back a foot 
in making a clumsy bow; and here without clumsiness of bow]; much discussion is available discussing 
whether Rama can retrace his step or not. It is said that stepping back in war is prohibited for a valorous 
warrior or to the epical hero. <em>sa~Ngrāme sa~Nsthānam anivṛittiḥ ca - gautama</em> and many more 
scriptures say this. And a relaxation to such a stance is said: <em>kvacit ati sankaṭa viṣhaye subhaṭānām 
abhito ayam apasarpaḥ - vedānta deshika</em> But here Rama is taking a runner&#39;s back-leg and it is 
not to be construed as an act of cowardice. Dharmākūtam clarifies this as: <em>vasca shatru vadhe 
kāmayamāna rāmsya dhanuṣhi bāṇa sandhāna ādi saukaryārtham apasarpaṇam rāmeṇa kṛitam bhūṣhaṇam 
eva na tu dūṣhaṇam | ata eva mūle apasarpaṇe kṛita astram eva hetumatvena maharṣhiṇā upanyastham 
| anantara shlokena khara vadāya shara sandhāna mokṣhaṇa ādi pratipādanam upapannam bhavati | bhityā 
apasarpaṇe punaḥ shara mokṣha anupapatto riti | dk</em> &#39;Wishing to eliminate the demon Rama has taken 
a back step. It is only to have a leeway between his target, arrow, and arrow-flinging place... In the 
verse itself the great-sage Valmiki incorporated words like <em>kṛita astra</em> that Rama is an exponent 
in archery [keeping some doubting Thomas&#39; in view.] Further, in the next few verses Rama eliminates 
Khara, thus it is not an act of cowardice...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Any wife on seeing her husband returning from a risky journey will embrace her husband delightfully, 
and nothing special about it. But the commentators attach a great significance to this situation.</p>

<p class="verloc">---</p><br>

<p class="comment">Firstly Seetha is <em>hṛiṣṭā</em> &#39;exultant...&#39; 
more than happiness. Rama&#39;s victory is the cause for that. <em>sati dharmiṇi dharmāḥ</em> 
&#39;nature will have its own peculiar property...&#39; Rama&#39;s victory is the peculiar property
<em>dharmi</em>, and the exultancy caused is its nature <em>dharma</em>.
<em>hṛiṣṭā</em> &#39;exulted&#39; &#39;thrilling, hair-raising, electrifying&#39; &#39;as though the 
inner joy is going to outburst trough the skin pores...&#39; Such is the joy of Seetha.</p>

<p class="comment">The cause for the extreme exultancy is said next.
<em>Vaidehi</em>, is the daughter of Videha King, Janaka and when she is said so, 
it is remembered that <em>mithila adhipatiḥ vīraḥ</em> &#39;ṃithila&#39;s king is the bravest 
of the brave...&#39; Thus, she is aware what bravery and victory are, and knowing that she hailed her victorious 
husband, for she is a worthy princess. <em>bhartāram pariṣvaje</em> &#39;husband, embraced...&#39; 
Is Rama a husband of Seetha or to total Universe? <em>loka bhartāram suṣuveya</em>. 
He is the husband of the total Universe. When she is the mother of all beings in the universe, and when 
her husband protects her progeny from the evildoers, will she not embrace that husband of hers, as well 
as of the Universe? The word <em>bharta</em> &#39;one who bears...&#39; and this Rama has 
no other burden to bear, except the Universe.</p>

<p class="comment">This embracing is <em>pariṣvaje, pari sa svaje</em> 
&#39;wholly embraced.&#39; She embraced him from all over and fomented his war-wounds with her warm breasts. 
Then, why for this much happy hugging? It is replied: <em>maharṣīṇām sukha āvaham 
pariṣvaje</em> &#39;one who brought comfort to great-sages, him she embraced...&#39; The great-sages are her 
children, supplicating her to recommend to the Supreme Being to bestow His grace for their salvation. 
Since Rama brought some relief by his paternal affection to these children-like sages, she is happy 
and hugging.</p>

<p class="comment">Seetha came out of a mountain cave and embraced Rama. This suggests 
that the innate soul <em>sheṣi</em> on the advise of a teacher, after leaving the 
cave-like living being, is released from bondages and embraces the master <em>sheṣhin</em>. 
This is the same predicament for her in Sundara Kanda, where the teacher Hanuma advises her to come 
with him, but she refuses, because her lord alone has to come conquering, as he has done now as far 
as her confinement is concerned. Here she is put in cave and guarded by Lakshmana, unlike demonesses 
guarding her in open-air gardens in Lanka. She came out of the cave and is joining her husband. Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">Next, ṃaheshvara Tīrtha records: <em>tam dṛiṣṭvā 
shatru hantāram</em> &#39;at him Rama, on seeing, enemy, eliminator...&#39;in that compound:
<em>tam</em> &#39;at him...&#39; that Rama, which one-Rama assumed himself as fourteen thousand 
Rama-s, appearing as each to each demon at the time of war, with his divinely gracious aspect
<em>divya mangala vigraha</em> and eliminated all demons, that Rama she saw.
<em>te tu yāvanta evā~Nau tāvān tu dadṛishe sataiḥ</em> As many demons are 
there, so many Rama-s are there on the battlefield.</p>

<p class="comment"><em>tam</em> &#39;at him...&#39; &#39;who eliminated fourteen 
thousand demons, single-handedly, , that too in seventy two minutes. These demons are so far undeafted 
even by Indra with all his forces. Rama defeated such demons without any damage to his person,
<em>a + vyayam</em> &#39;unscathed, undamaged... and very easily also...&#39; at such a 
Rama Seetha saw.</p>

<p class="comment"><em>tam</em> &#39;him&#39; who looks girlish. Seetha 
once said that Rama is girly not only in his looks but also in bravery, perhaps.

<em>rāma jāmātaram 
prāpya striyam puruṣha vigraham</em> Ayodhya Part I, 30-3. When Rama dissuades Seetha from 
coming to forests, Seetha said to Rama, &#39;my father is the King of ṃithila and he may think that you 
have left me behind at Ayodhya unable to protect me in forests... thus my father may also think that 
he got a &#39;girl&#39; as his son-in-law in you...&#39; Through this is a tongue-in-cheek expression Seetha reminded 
Rama at that situation of his <em>ṃohini rūpa</em> &#39;getup of ṃohini...&#39; which he 
assumed at the time of churning ṃilky Ocean, it is her woomanhood that spoke like that. Though not then, 
even now Rama looks girlishly pleasant, if he is not summoning wrath upon him, as per his attributes,
<em>puṇDarika vishāla aksha, somavat priya darshanaḥ</em> &#39;lotus-petal-eyed, moon-like-delightful-aspect...&#39; 
And he becomes unsightly, only if angered. Such a girlish Rama has won war, and at him Seetha saw in 
admiration about his mannishness. Now her father Janaka will definitely appreciate his son-in-law Rama. 
King Janaka is a result-oriented king, as said in Gita, 3-20: <em>karmaṇi evahi samsiddham 
āsthitaḥ janakādayaḥ</em> &#39;Janaka and others are involved in self-less- result-oriented deeds...&#39; 
and facing him without results is impossible. Thus Seetha&#39;s opinion is &#39;my father Janaka who is result-oriented 
and self-less in his pursuits, he will now appreciate Rama, since Rama has also accomplished a self-less 
pursuit in saving the sages...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment"><em>tam shatru hantāram</em> &#39;at him... who 
has annihilated the enemies in war...&#39; as he has annihilated troops and troops of unwieldy demons as 
said at: <em>taiḥ dhanū~Nṣhi 
dhvaja agrāṇi carmāṇi ca shirā~Nsi ca || 3-25-21 and at bahūn sa hasta ābharaṇān ūrūn kari kara 
upamān | 3-25-22 [A]</em> and also who later said that he will emerge, as and when needed 
to eradicate vice, as at <em>paritraṇāya sādhūnām vināshāya ca duṣkṛitām - 
Gita: 4-8</em> And Seetha saw at such an omnipotent Being who is an eliminator of evil.</p>

<p class="comment"><em>maharṣiṇām sukha āvaham</em> &#39;for great-sages, 
accorder of comfort...&#39; <em>dṛiṣṭvā vaidehī babhūva</em> &#39;on seeing Vaidehi 
became...&#39; she became one with herself <em>bhū sattāyām</em>. When it is said
<em>ātmā vai puruṣasya dārā</em> &#39;wife indeed is the soul of manl...&#39; that soul 
of Rama, namely Seetha is so far in a dilemma, because Rama is a lone-warrior against fourteen-thousand 
demons and his safe return is ambiguous. Now that he remained unhurt, that soul called Seetha, has regained 
her abode in Rama. Then <em>hṛiṣṭā pariṣvaje</em> &#39;delightfully embraced...&#39; ṃaheshvara 
Tīrtha.</p>

<p class="comment">Dharmākūtam also derives the same meanings, but with reference 
to dharma:</p>
