<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama refutes the atheistic arguments of Jabali and enunciates the importance of truthfulness. He states that truth is God and all
virtues follow truthfulness. Rama further adds that there is nothing higher than truth. He announces that he wants to fulfil the command of is
father, who was a devotee of truth and stay back in the forest. Jabali replies that just for the sake of convincing Rama to return to Ayodhya, he has
spoken the words of a non-believer.</p>
