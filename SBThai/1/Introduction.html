The <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัม</span></i> hits on the target of the Absolute Truth. The conception of God indicates the controller, whereas the conception of the Absolute Truth indicates the <i>summum bonum - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สุมฺมุมฺ โพนุมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สุมมุม โพนุม</span></i> or the ultimate source of all energies. There is no difference of opinion about the personal feature of God as the controller because a controller cannot be impersonal. Of course modern government, especially democratic government, is impersonal to some extent, but ultimately the chief executive head is a person, and the impersonal feature of government is subordinate to the personal feature. So without a doubt whenever we refer to control over others we must admit the existence of a personal feature. Because there are different controllers for different managerial positions, there may be many small gods. According to the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภะคะวัท-คีตา</span></i> any controller who has some specific extraordinary power is called a <i>vibhūtimat sattva, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วิภูติมตฺ สตฺตฺว,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วิภูติมัต สัตตวะ,</span></i> or controller empowered by the Lord. There are many <i>vibhūtimat sattvas, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วิภูติมตฺ สตฺตฺวสฺ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วิภูติมัต สัตตวัส,</span></i> controllers or gods with various specific powers, but the Absolute Truth is one without a second. This <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัม</span></i> designates the Absolute Truth or the <i>summum bonum - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สุมฺมุมฺ โพนุมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สุมมุม โพนุม</span></i> as the <i>paraṁ satyam. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปะรัง สัตยัมฯ</span></i></p></div>

The gods or the controllers are undoubtedly persons, but the <i>paraṁ satyam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปะรัง สัตยัม</span></i> from whom the gods derive powers of control is the Supreme Person. The Sanskrit word <i>īśvara - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อีศฺวร</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อีศวะระ</span></i> (controller) conveys the import of God, but the Supreme Person is called the <i>parameśvara, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปรเมศฺวร,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปะระเมศวะระ,</span></i> or the supreme <i>īśvara. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อีศฺวรฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อีศวะระฯ</span></i> The Supreme Person, or <i>parameśvara, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปรเมศฺวร,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปะระเมศวะระ,</span></i> is the supreme conscious personality, and because He does not derive any power from any other source, He is supremely independent. In the Vedic literatures Brahmā is described as the supreme god or the head of all other gods like Indra, Candra and Varuṇa, but the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> confirms that even Brahmā is not independent as far as his power and knowledge are concerned. He received knowledge in the form of the <i>Vedas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - เวทัส</span></i> from the Supreme Person who resides within the heart of every living being. That Supreme Personality knows everything directly and indirectly. Individual infinitesimal persons, who are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality, may know directly and indirectly everything about their bodies or external features, but the Supreme Personality knows everything about both His external and internal features.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13209" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The words <i>janmādy asya - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ชนฺมาทฺยฺ อสฺย</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ชันมาทย อัสยะ</span></i> suggest that the source of all production, maintenance or destruction is the same supreme conscious person. Even in our present experience we can know that nothing is generated from inert matter, but inert matter can be generated from the living entity. For instance, by contact with the living entity, the material body develops into a working machine. Men with a poor fund of knowledge mistake the bodily machinery to be the living being, but the fact is that the living being is the basis of the bodily machine. The bodily machine is useless as soon as the living spark is away from it. Similarly, the original source of all material energy is the Supreme Person. This fact is expressed in all the Vedic literatures, and all the exponents of spiritual science have accepted this truth. The living force is called Brahman, and one of the greatest <i>ācāryas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยัส</span></i> (teachers), namely Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, has preached that Brahman is substance whereas the cosmic world is category. The original source of all energies is the living force, and He is logically accepted as the Supreme Person. He is therefore conscious of everything past, present and future, and also of each and every corner of His manifestations, both material and spiritual. An imperfect living being does not even know what is happening within his own personal body. He eats his food but does not know how this food is transformed into energy or how it sustains his body. When a living being is perfect, he is aware of everything that happens, and since the Supreme Person is all-perfect, it is quite natural that He knows everything in all detail. Consequently the perfect personality is addressed in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัม</span></i> as Vāsudeva, or one who lives everywhere in full consciousness and in full possession of His complete energy. All of this is clearly explained in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัม,</span></i> and the reader has ample opportunity to study this critically.</p></div>

The essence of His preaching is that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who appeared at Vrajabhūmi (Vṛndāvana) as the son of the King of Vraja (Nanda Mahārāja), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore worshipable by all. Vṛndāvana-dhāma is nondifferent from the Lord because the name, fame, form and place where the Lord manifests Himself are all identical with the Lord as absolute knowledge. Therefore Vṛndāvana-dhāma is as worshipable as the Lord. The highest form of transcendental worship of the Lord was exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabhūmi in the form of pure affection for the Lord, and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends this process as the most excellent mode of worship.

Unfortunately the people of the world are still ignorant of them, but when these literatures, which are mostly in Sanskrit and Bengali, come to light the world and when they are presented before thinking people, then India’s glory and the message of love will overflood this morbid world, which is vainly searching after peace and prosperity by various illusory methods not approved by the <i>ācāryas</i> in the chain of disciplic succession.</p></div>

During the hours of eclipse it was the custom of the Hindu public to take bath in the Ganges or any other sacred river and chant the Vedic <i>mantras - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - มันตรัส</span></i> for purification. When Lord Caitanya was born during the lunar eclipse, all India was roaring with the holy sound of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. These sixteen names of the Lord are mentioned in many <i>Purāṇas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปุราณสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปุราณัส</span></i> and <i>Upaniṣads, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อุปนิษทฺสฺ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อุปะนิษัทส,</span></i> and they are described as the <i>Tāraka-brahma nāma - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ตารก-พฺรหฺม นาม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ตาระกะ-พรัหมะ นามะ</span></i> of this age.

There are innumerable names of the Lord both in India and outside, and all of them are equally good because all of them indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because these sixteen are especially recommended for this age, people should take advantage of them and follow the path of the great <i>ācāryas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยัส</span></i> who attained success by practicing the rules of the <i>śāstras - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัส</span></i> (revealed scriptures).</p></div>

This mission was to preach the importance of chanting the holy names of the Lord in this Age of Kali (quarrel). In this present age quarrels take place even over trifles, and therefore the <i>śāstras - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัส</span></i> have recommended for this age a common platform for realization, namely chanting the holy names of the Lord. People can hold meetings to glorify the Lord in their respective languages and with melodious songs, and if such performances are executed in an offenseless manner, it is certain that the participants will gradually attain spiritual perfection without having to undergo more rigorous methods. At such meetings everyone, the learned and the foolish, the rich and the poor, the Hindus and the Muslims, the Englishmen and the Indians, and the <i>caṇḍālas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">จณฺฑาลสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - จัณฑาลัส</span></i> and the <i>brāhmaṇas, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณัส,</span></i> can all hear the transcendental sounds and thus cleanse the dust of material association from the mirror of the heart. To confirm the Lord’s mission, all the people of the world will accept the holy name of the Lord as the common platform for the universal religion of mankind. In other words, the advent of the holy name took place along with the advent of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</p></div>

This peculiar incident was observed by the neighbors with awe and veneration. Sometimes the young girls took pleasure in making the Lord cry and then stopping Him by chanting the holy name. So from His very childhood the Lord began to preach the importance of the holy name. In His early age Lord Śrī Caitanya was known as Nimāi. This name was given by His beloved mother because the Lord took His birth beneath a <i>nimba - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">นิมฺพ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - นิมพะ</span></i> tree in the courtyard of His paternal house.</p></div>

At this time it was customary to offer the child both coins and books in order to get some indication of the future tendencies of the child. The Lord was offered on one side coins and on the other the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภาคะวะตัม</span>. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัมฯ</span></i> The Lord accepted the <i>Bhāgavatam</i> instead of the coins.</p></div>

Once He was stolen by a thief who intended to steal His ornaments, but the Lord took a pleasure trip on the shoulder of the bewildered thief, who was searching for a solitary place in order to rob the baby. It so happened that the thief, wandering hither and thither, finally arrived just before the house of Jagannātha Miśra and, being afraid of being caught, dropped the baby at once. Of course the anxious parents and relatives were glad to see the lost child.</p></div>

The next time the same thing happened, and when this happened repeatedly for the third time, the baby was finally put to bed. At about twelve at night when all the members of the house were fast asleep within their closed rooms, the pilgrim <i>brāhmaṇa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณะ</span></i> offered his specially prepared foods to the Deity, and, in the same way, the baby Lord appeared before the pilgrim and spoiled his offerings.

At the bathing <i>ghāṭa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ฆาฏ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ฆาฏะ</span></i> He also used to play jokes on the neighboring girls who engaged in worshiping Śiva in hopes of getting good husbands. This is a common practice amongst unmarried girls in Hindu families. While they were engaged in such worship, the Lord naughtily appeared before them and said, “My dear sisters, please give Me all the offerings you have just brought for Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is My devotee, and Pārvatī is My maidservant. If you worship Me, then Lord Śiva and all the other demigods will be more satisfied.” Some of them refused to obey the naughty Lord, and He would curse them that due to their refusal they would be married to old men who had seven children by their previous wives. Out of fear and sometimes out of love the girls would also offer Him various goods, and then the Lord would bless them and assure them that they would have very good young husbands and that they would be mothers of dozens of children. The blessings would enliven the girls, but they used often to complain of these incidents to their mothers.</p></div>

It so happened that Nimāi Paṇḍita met Keśava Kāśmīri while strolling on the banks of the Ganges. The Lord requested him to compose a Sanskrit verse in praise of the Ganges, and the <i>paṇḍita</i> within a short time composed a hundred <i>śloka - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลก</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกะ</span>s - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลกสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกัส</span>, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลกสฺ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกัส,</span></i> reciting the verses like a storm and showing the strength of his vast learning.

Although this matter was ended prior to any public meeting, the news spread like wildfire all over Navadvīpa. But finally Keśava Kāśmīri was ordered in a dream by Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, to submit to the Lord, and thus the Kashmir <i>paṇḍita</i> became a follower of the Lord.</p></div>

They were so jealous that they finally took the matter before the Muslim magistrate at Navadvīpa. Bengal was then governed by Pathans, and the governor of the province was Nawab Hussain Shah. The Muslim magistrate of Navadvīpa took up the complaints of the <i>brāhmaṇas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณัส</span></i> seriously, and at first he warned the followers of Nimāi Paṇḍita not to chant loudly the name of Hari.

The great crowds assembled at the Kazi’s house displayed a violent temper, but the Lord asked them to be peaceful. At this time the Kazi came down and tried to pacify the Lord by addressing Him as nephew. He pointed out that he referred to Nīlāmbara Cakravartī as uncle, and thus Śrīmatī Śacīdevī, Nimāi Paṇḍita’s mother, was his cousin-sister. He asked the Lord whether his sister’s son could be angry at His maternal uncle, and the Lord replied that since the Kazi was His maternal uncle he should receive his nephew well at his home. In this way the issue was mitigated, and the two learned scholars began a long discussion on the Koran and Hindu <i>śāstras. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัสฯ</span></i> The Lord raised the question of cow-killing, and the Kazi properly answered Him by referring to the Koran. In turn the Kazi also questioned the Lord about cow sacrifice in the <i>Vedas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - เวทัส</span>, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - เวทัส,</span></i> and the Lord replied that such sacrifice as mentioned in the <i>Vedas</i> is not actually cow-killing. In that sacrifice an old bull or cow was sacrificed for the sake of receiving a fresh younger life by the power of Vedic <i>mantras. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - มันตรัสฯ</span></i> But in the Kali-yuga such cow sacrifices are forbidden because there are no qualified <i>brāhmaṇas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณัส</span></i> capable of conducting such a sacrifice. In fact, in Kali-yuga all <i>yajñas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ยชฺญสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ยัชญัส</span></i> (sacrifices) are forbidden because they are useless attempts by foolish men. In Kali-yuga only the <i>saṅkīrtana - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ</span> yajña - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน ยชฺญ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ ยัชญะ</span></i> is recommended for all practical purposes. Speaking in this way, the Lord finally convinced the Kazi, who became the Lord’s follower. The Kazi thenceforth declared that no one should hinder the <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement which was started by the Lord, and the Kazi left this order in his will for the sake of progeny. The Kazi’s tomb still exists in the area of Navadvīpa, and Hindu pilgrims go there to show their respects. The Kazi’s descendants are residents, and they never objected to <i>saṅkīrtana, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ,</span></i> even during the Hindu-Muslim riot days.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13237" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This incident shows clearly that the Lord was not a so-called timid Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava is a fearless devotee of the Lord, and for the right cause he can take any step suitable for the purpose. Arjuna was also a Vaiṣṇava devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and he fought valiantly for the satisfaction of the Lord. Similarly, Vajrāṅgajī, or Hanumān, was also a devotee of Lord Rāma, and he gave lessons to the nondevotee party of Rāvaṇa. The principles of Vaiṣṇavism are to satisfy the Lord by all means. A Vaiṣṇava is by nature a nonviolent, peaceful living being, and he has all the good qualities of God, but when the nondevotee blasphemes the Lord or His devotee, the Vaiṣṇava never tolerates such impudency.</p></div>

Two <i>brāhmaṇa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณะ</span></i> gentlemen named Cāpala and Gopāla, who also happened to be maternal uncles of the Lord, were inflicted with leprosy by way of chastisement, and later, when they were repentant, they were accepted by the Lord. In the course of His preaching work, He used to send daily all His followers, including Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu and Ṭhākura Haridāsa, two chief whips of His party, from door to door to preach the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัมฯ</span></i> All of Navadvīpa was surcharged with His <i>saṅkīrtana - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ</span></i> movement, and His headquarters were situated at the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura and Śrī Advaita Prabhu, two of His chief householder disciples. These two learned heads of the <i>brāhmaṇa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณะ</span></i> community were the most ardent supporters of Lord Caitanya’s movement. Śrī Advaita Prabhu was the chief cause for the advent of the Lord. When Advaita Prabhu saw that the total human society was full of materialistic activities and devoid of devotional service, which alone could save mankind from the threefold miseries of material existence, He, out of His causeless compassion for the age-worn human society, prayed fervently for the incarnation of the Lord and continually worshiped the Lord with water of the Ganges and leaves of the holy <i>tulasī - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ตุลสี</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ตุละสี</span></i> tree.

                        <div id="bb13239" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Once Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura were walking down a main road, and on the way they saw a roaring crowd assembled. Upon inquiring from passersby, they understood that two brothers, named Jagāi and Mādhāi, were creating a public disturbance in a drunken state. They also heard that these two brothers were born in a respectable <i>brāhmaṇa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณะ</span></i> family, but because of low association they had turned into debauchees of the worst type. They were not only drunkards but also meat-eaters, woman-hunters, dacoits and sinners of all description. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu heard all of these stories and decided that these two fallen souls must be the first to be delivered. If they were delivered from their sinful life, then the good name of Lord Caitanya would be even still more glorified. Thinking in this way, Nityānanda Prabhu and Haridāsa pushed their way through the crowd and asked the two brothers to chant the holy name of Lord Hari. The drunken brothers became enraged upon this request and attacked Nityānanda Prabhu with filthy language. Both brothers chased them a considerable distance. In the evening the report of the preaching work was submitted to the Lord, and He was glad to learn that Nityānanda and Haridāsa had attempted to deliver such a stupid pair of fellows.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13240" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The next day Nityānanda Prabhu went to see the brothers, and as soon as He approached them one of them threw a piece of earthen pot at Him. This struck Him on the forehead, and immediately blood began to flow. But Nityānanda Prabhu was so kind that instead of protesting this heinous act, He said, “It does not matter that you have thrown this stone at Me. I still request you to chant the holy name of Lord Hari.”</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13241" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>One of the brothers, Jagāi, was astonished to see this behavior of Nityānanda Prabhu, and he at once fell down at His feet and asked Him to pardon his sinful brother. When Mādhāi again attempted to hurt Nityānanda Prabhu, Jagāi stopped him and implored him to fall down at His feet. In the meantime the news of Nityānanda’s injury reached the Lord, who at once hurried to the spot in a fiery and angry mood. The Lord immediately invoked His Sudarśana <i>cakra - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">จกฺร</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - จักระ</span></i> (the Lord’s ultimate weapon, shaped like a wheel) to kill the sinners, but Nityānanda Prabhu reminded Him of His mission. The mission of the Lord was to deliver the hopelessly fallen souls of Kali-yuga, and the brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi were typical examples of these fallen souls. Ninety percent of the population of this age resembles these brothers, despite high birth and mundane respectability. According to the verdict of the revealed scriptures, the total population of the world in this age will be of the lowest <i>śūdra - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศูทระ</span></i> quality, or even lower. It should be noted that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never acknowledged the stereotyped caste system by birthright; rather, He strictly followed the verdict of the <i>śāstras - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัส</span></i> in the matter of one’s <i>svarūpa, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สฺวรูป,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สวะรูปะ,</span></i> or real identity.</p></div>

The Lord was also asked by Nityānanda Prabhu to accept these repenting souls, and the Lord agreed to accept them on one condition, that they henceforward completely give up all their sinful activities and habits of debauchery. Both the brothers agreed and promised to give up all their sinful habits, and the kind Lord accepted them and did not again refer to their past misdeeds.</p></div>

In this Kali-yuga practically all people are of the quality of Jagāi and Mādhāi.

He asked the devotees what they wanted to eat, and when He was informed that they wanted to eat mangoes, He asked for a seed of a mango, although this fruit was out of season. When the seed was brought to Him He sowed it in the yard of Śrīnivāsa, and at once a creeper began to grow out of the seed. Within no time this creeper became a full-grown mango tree heavy with more ripened fruits than the devotees could eat. The tree remained in Śrīnivāsa’s yard, and from then on the devotees used to take as many mangoes from the tree as they wanted.</p></div>

The Lord, who was in ecstasy, was thus disturbed by these foolish students. He chastised them and chased them away. The students were almost the same age as the Lord, and thus they wrongly thought of the Lord as one of their peers. They held a meeting and resolved that they would attack the Lord if He dared to punish them again in such a manner. This incident provoked some malicious talks about the Lord on the part of the general public.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13247" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When the Lord became aware of this, He began to consider the various types of men found in society.

If they are to begin their life of spiritual realization, they must some way or another offer obeisances unto Me.” Thus the Lord decided to accept the renounced order of life (<i>sannyāsa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสะ</span></i>) because people in general were inclined to offer respects to a <i>sannyāsī. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสีฯ</span></i></p></div>

His mother met Him at the house of Advaita Prabhu, and when she saw her son in <i>sannyāsa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสะ</span></i> dress, she lamented. By way of compromise, she requested her son to make His headquarters in Purī so that she would easily be able to get information about Him. The Lord granted this last desire of His beloved mother. After this incident the Lord started for Purī, leaving all the residents of Navadvīpa in an ocean of lamentation over His separation.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13253" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord visited many important places on the way to Purī. He visited the temple of Gopīnāthajī, who had stolen condensed milk for His devotee Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī. Since then Deity Gopīnāthajī is well known as Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha. The Lord relished this story with great pleasure. The propensity of stealing is there even in the absolute consciousness, but because this propensity is exhibited by the Absolute, it loses its perverted nature and thus becomes worshipable even by Lord Caitanya on the basis of the absolute consideration that the Lord and His stealing propensity are one and identical. This interesting story of Gopīnāthajī is vividly explained in the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ไจตันยะ-จะริตามฤตะ</span></i> by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13254" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>After visiting the temple of Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha of Remuṇā at Balasore in Orissa, the Lord proceeded towards Purī and on the way visited the temple of Sākṣi-gopāla, who appeared as a witness in the matter of two <i>brāhmaṇa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณะ</span></i> devotees’ family quarrel. The Lord heard the story of Sākṣi-gopāla with great pleasure because He wanted to impress upon the atheists that the worshipable Deities in the temples approved by the great <i>ācāryas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยัส</span></i> are not idols, as alleged by men with a poor fund of knowledge. The Deity in the temple is the <i>arcā - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อัรจา</span></i> incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus the Deity is identical with the Lord in all respects. He responds to the proportion of the devotee’s affection for Him. In the story of Sākṣi-gopāla, in which there was a family misunderstanding by two devotees of the Lord, the Lord, in order to mitigate the turmoil as well as to show specific favor to His servitors, traveled from Vṛndāvana to Vidyānagara, a village in Orissa, in the form of His <i>arcā - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อัรจา</span></i> incarnation. From there the Deity was brought to Cuttack, and thus the temple of Sākṣi-gopāla is even today visited by thousands of pilgrims on the way to Jagannātha Purī. The Lord stayed overnight there and began to proceed toward Purī. On the way, His <i>sannyāsa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสะ</span></i> rod was broken by Nityānanda Prabhu. The Lord became apparently angry with Him about this and went alone to Purī, leaving His companions behind.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13255" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At Purī, when He entered the temple of Jagannātha, He became at once saturated with transcendental ecstasy and fell down on the floor of the temple unconscious. The custodians of the temple could not understand the transcendental feats of the Lord, but there was a great learned <i>paṇḍita - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปัณฑิตะ</span></i> named Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was present, and he could understand that the Lord’s losing His consciousness upon entering the Jagannātha temple was not an ordinary thing. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was the chief appointed <i>paṇḍita - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปัณฑิตะ</span></i> in the court of the King of Orissa, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, was attracted by the youthful luster of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and could understand that such a transcendental trance was only rarely exhibited and only then by the topmost devotees who are already on the transcendental plane in complete forgetfulness of material existence. Only a liberated soul could show such a transcendental feat, and the Bhaṭṭācārya, who was vastly learned, could understand this in the light of the transcendental literature with which he was familiar. He therefore asked the custodians of the temple not to disturb the unknown <i>sannyāsī. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสีฯ</span></i> He asked them to take the Lord to his home so He could be further observed in His unconscious state. The Lord was at once carried to the home of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who at that time had sufficient power of authority due to his being the <i>sabhā-paṇḍita - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ปัณฑิตะ</span>, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สภา-ปณฺฑิต,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สะภา-ปัณฑิตะ,</span></i> or the state dean of faculty in Sanskrit literatures. The learned <i>paṇḍita</i> wanted to scrutinizingly test the transcendental feats of Lord Caitanya because often unscrupulous devotees imitate physical feats in order to flaunt transcendental achievements just to attract innocent people and take advantage of them. A learned scholar like the Bhaṭṭācārya can detect such imposters, and when he finds them out he at once rejects them.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13256" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the case of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Bhaṭṭācārya tested all the symptoms in the light of the <i>śāstras. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัสฯ</span></i> He tested as a scientist, not as a foolish sentimentalist. He observed the movement of the stomach, the beating of the heart and the breathing of the nostrils. He also felt the pulse of the Lord and saw that all His bodily activities were in complete suspension. When he put a small cotton swab before the nostrils, he found that there was a slight breathing as the fine fibers of cotton moved slightly. Thus he came to know that the Lord’s unconscious trance was genuine, and he began to treat Him in the prescribed fashion. But Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu could only be treated in a special way. He would respond only to the resounding of the holy names of the Lord by His devotees. This special treatment was unknown to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya because the Lord was still unknown to him. When the Bhaṭṭācārya saw Him for the first time in the temple, he simply took Him to be one of many pilgrims.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13257" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the meantime the companions of the Lord, who reached the temple a little after Him, heard of the Lord’s transcendental feats and of His being carried away by the Bhaṭṭācārya. The pilgrims at the temple were still gossiping about the incident. But by chance, one of these pilgrims had met Gopīnātha Ācārya, who was known to Gadādhara Paṇḍita, and from him it was learned that the Lord was lying in an unconscious state at the residence of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who happened to be the brother-in-law of Gopīnātha Ācārya. All the members of the party were introduced by Gadādhara Paṇḍita to Gopīnātha Ācārya, who took them all to the house of Bhaṭṭācārya, where the Lord was lying unconscious in a spiritual trance. All the members then chanted loudly the holy name of the Lord Hari as usual, and the Lord regained His consciousness. After this, Bhaṭṭācārya received all the members of the party, including Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, and asked them to become his guests of honor. The party, including the Lord, went for a bath in the sea, and the Bhaṭṭācārya arranged for their residence and meals at the house of Kāśī Miśra. Gopīnātha Ācārya, his brother-in-law, also assisted. There were some friendly talks about the Lord’s divinity between the two brothers-in-law, and in this argument Gopīnātha Ācārya, who knew the Lord before, now tried to establish the Lord as the Personality of Godhead, and the Bhaṭṭācārya tried to establish Him as one of the great devotees. Both of them argued from the angle of vision of authentic <i>śāstras - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัส</span></i> and not on the strength of sentimental <i>vox populi. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โวx โปปุลิฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - โวx โปปุลิฯ</span></i> The incarnations of God are determined by authentic <i>śāstras - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัส</span></i> and not by popular votes of foolish fanatics. Because Lord Caitanya was an incarnation of God in fact, foolish fanatics have proclaimed so many so-called incarnations of God in this age without referring to authentic scriptures. But Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya or Gopīnātha Ācārya did not indulge in such foolish sentimentalism; on the contrary, both of them tried to establish or reject His divinity on the strength of authentic <i>śāstras. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศาสตรัสฯ</span></i></p></div>

                        <div id="bb13296" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord, after hearing the Bhaṭṭācārya, thanked him for the scholarly presentation of the <i>śloka - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลก</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกะ</span>, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลก,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกะ,</span></i> and then, at the request of the Bhaṭṭācārya, the Lord explained the <i>śloka</i> in sixty-four different ways without touching the nine explanations given by the Bhaṭṭācārya.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13298" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Thus after hearing the explanation of the <i>ātmārāma śloka - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาตฺมาราม โศฺลก</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาตมารามะ ศโลกะ</span></i> from the Lord, the Bhaṭṭācārya was convinced that such a scholarly presentation is impossible for an earthly creature.* Before this, Śrī Gopīnātha Ācārya had tried to convince him of the divinity of the Lord, but at the time he could not so accept Him. But the Bhaṭṭācārya was astounded by the Lord’s exposition of the <i>Vedānta-sūtra - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">เวทานฺต-สูตฺร</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - เวทานตะ-สูตระ</span></i> and explanations of the <i>ātmārāma śloka, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาตฺมาราม โศฺลก,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาตมารามะ ศโลกะ,</span></i> and thus he began to think that he had committed a great offense at the lotus feet of the Lord by not recognizing Him to be Kṛṣṇa Himself. He then surrendered unto Him, repenting for his past dealings with Him, and the Lord was kind enough to accept the Bhaṭṭācārya. Out of His causeless mercy, the Lord manifested before him first as four-handed Nārāyaṇa and then again as two-handed Lord Kṛṣṇa with a flute in His hand.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13299" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Bhaṭṭācārya at once fell down at the lotus feet of the Lord and composed many suitable <i>ślokas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลกสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกัส</span></i> in praise of the Lord by His grace. He composed one hundred <i>ślokas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">โศฺลกสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศโลกัส</span></i> in praise of the Lord. The Lord then embraced him, and out of transcendental ecstasy the Bhaṭṭācārya lost consciousness of the physical state of life. Tears, trembling, throbbing of the heart, perspiration, emotional waves, dancing, singing, crying and all the eight symptoms of trance were manifested in the body of the Bhaṭṭācārya. Śrī Gopīnātha Ācārya became very glad and astonished by this marvelous conversion of his brother-in-law by the grace of the Lord.</p></div>

                        <div id="bb13301" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>1. Let me surrender unto the Personality of Godhead who has appeared now as Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is the ocean of all mercy and has now come down to teach us material detachment, learning and devotional service to Himself.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13302" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>2.

                        <div id="bb13303" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord explained the word <i>mukti - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - มุกติ</span></i> to be equivalent to the word Viṣṇu, or the Personality of Godhead. To attain <i>mukti, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - มุกติ,</span></i> or liberation from the bondage of material existence, is to attain to the service of the Lord.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13304" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord then proceeded towards South India for some time and converted all He met on the way to become devotees of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Such devotees also converted many others to the cult of devotional service, or to the <i>Bhāgavata-dharma - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภาคะวะตะ-ธัรมะ</span></i> of the Lord, and thus He reached the bank of the Godāvarī, where He met Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya, the governor of Madras on behalf of Mahārāja Pratāparudra, the King of Orissa. His talks with Rāmānanda Rāya are very important for higher realization of transcendental knowledge, and the conversation itself forms a small booklet. We shall, however, give herewith a summary of the conversation.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13305" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was a self-realized soul, although outwardly he belonged to a caste lower than the <i>brāhmaṇa - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พราหมะณะ</span></i> in social status. He was not in the renounced order of life, and besides that he was a high government servant in the state. Still, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted him as a liberated soul on the strength of the high order of his realization of transcendental knowledge. Similarly, the Lord accepted Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, a veteran devotee of the Lord coming from a Mohammedan family. And there are many other great devotees of the Lord who came from different communities, sects and castes. The Lord’s only criterion was the standard of devotional service of the particular person. He was not concerned with the outward dress of a man; He was concerned only with the inner soul and its activities. Therefore all the missionary activities of the Lord are to be understood to be on the spiritual plane, and as such the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or the cult of <i>Bhāgavata-dharma, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภาคะวะตะ-ธัรมะ,</span></i> has nothing to do with mundane affairs, sociology, politics, economic development or any such sphere of life. <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัม</span></i> is the purely transcendental urge of the soul.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13306" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When He met Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya on the bank of the Godāvarī, the <i>varṇāśrama - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วัรณาศระมะ</span>-dharma - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วัรณาศระมะ-ธัรมะ</span></i> followed by the Hindus was mentioned by the Lord. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya said that by following the principles of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วัรณาศระมะ-ธัรมะ</span>, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วัรณาศระมะ-ธัรมะ,</span></i> the system of four castes and four orders of human life, everyone could realize Transcendence. In the opinion of the Lord, the system of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma</i> is superficial only, and it has very little to do with the highest realization of spiritual values. The highest perfection of life is to get detached from the material attachment and proportionately realize the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead recognizes a living being who is progressing in that line. Devotional service, therefore, is the culmination of the culture of all knowledge. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared for the deliverance of all fallen souls, He advised the deliverance of all living entities as follows. The Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, from whom all living entities have emanated, must be worshiped by all their respective engagements, because everything that we see is also the expansion of His energy. That is the way of real perfection, and it is approved by all bona fide <i>ācāryas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยัส</span></i> past and present. The system of <i>varṇāśrama</i> is more or less based on moral and ethical principles. There is very little realization of the Transcendence as such, and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected it as superficial and asked Rāmānanda Rāya to go further into the matter.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13307" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya then suggested renunciation of fruitive actions unto the Lord. The <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภะคะวัท-คีตา</span></i> (9.27) advises in this connection: “Whatever you do, whatever you eat and whatever you give, as well as whatever you perform in penance, offer to Me alone.” This dedication on the part of the worker suggests that the Personality of Godhead is a step higher than the impersonal conception of the <i>varṇāśrama - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วัรณาศระมะ</span></i> system, but still the relation of the living being and the Lord is not distinct in that way. The Lord therefore rejected this proposition and asked Rāmānanda Rāya to go further.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13308" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Rāya then suggested renunciation of the <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วัรณาศระมะ-ธัรมะ</span></i> and acceptance of devotional service. The Lord did not approve of this suggestion also for the reason that all of a sudden one should not renounce his position, for that may not bring in the desired result.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13310" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It was further suggested by Rāya that attainment of spiritual realization freed from the material conception of life is the topmost achievement for a living being. The Lord rejected this suggestion also because on the plea of such spiritual realization much havoc has been wrought by unscrupulous persons; therefore all of a sudden this is not possible. The Rāya then suggested sincere association of self-realized souls and hearing submissively the transcendental message of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. This suggestion was welcomed by the Lord. This suggestion was made following in the footsteps of Brahmājī, who said that the Personality of Godhead is known as <i>ajita - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อชิต</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อะชิตะ</span>, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อชิต,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อะชิตะ,</span></i> or the one who cannot be conquered or approached by anyone. But such <i>ajita - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ชิต</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ชิตะ</span></i> also becomes <i>jita</i> (conquered) by one method, which is very simple and easy. The simple method is that one has to give up the arrogant attitude of declaring oneself to be God Himself. One must be very meek and submissive and try to live peacefully by lending the ear to the speeches of the transcendentally self-realized soul who speaks on the message of <i>Bhāgavata-dharma, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภาคะวะตะ-ธัรมะ,</span></i> or the religion of glorifying the Supreme Lord and His devotees. To glorify a great man is a natural instinct for living beings, but they have not learned to glorify the Lord. Perfection of life is attained simply by glorifying the Lord in association with a self-realized devotee of the Lord.* The self-realized devotee is he who surrenders unto the Lord fully and who does not have attachment for material prosperity. Material prosperity and sense enjoyment and their advancement are all activities of ignorance in human society. Peace and friendship are impossible for a society detached from the association of God and His devotees. It is imperative, therefore, that one sincerely seek the association of pure devotees and hear them patiently and submissively from any position of life. The position of a person in the higher or lower status of life does not hamper one in the path of self-realization. The only thing one has to do is to hear from a self-realized soul with a routine program. The teacher may also deliver lectures from the Vedic literatures, following in the footsteps of the bygone <i>ācāryas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยัส</span></i> who realized the Absolute Truth. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended this simple method of self-realization generally known as <i>Bhāgavata-dharma. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺมฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภาคะวะตะ-ธัรมะฯ</span></i> <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ศรีมัท-ภาคะวะตัม</span></i> is the perfect guide for this purpose.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13311" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Above these topics discussed by the Lord and Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, there were still more elevated spiritual talks between the two great personalities, and we purposely withhold those topics for the present because one has to come to the spiritual plane before further talks with Rāmānanda Rāya can be heard. We have presented further talks of Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya with the Lord in another book (<i>Teachings of Lord Caitanya - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">เตอฉินฺคฺสฺ โอฟฺ โลรฺทฺ ไจตนฺย</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - เตอะฉินคส โอฟ โลรท ไจตันยะ</span></i>).</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13312" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At the conclusion of this meeting, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was advised by the Lord to retire from service and come to Purī so that they could live together and relish a transcendental relationship. Some time later, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya retired from the government service and took a pension from the King. He returned to his residence in Purī, where he was one of the most confidential devotees of the Lord. There was another gentleman at Purī of the name Śikhi Māhiti, who was also a confidant like Rāmānanda Rāya. The Lord used to hold confidential talks on spiritual values with three or four companions at Purī, and He passed eighteen years in that way in spiritual trance. His talks were recorded by His private secretary Śrī Dāmodara Gosvāmī, one of the four most intimate devotees.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13313" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord extensively traveled all over the southern part of India. The great saint of Mahārāṣṭra known as Saint Tukārāma was also initiated by the Lord. Saint Tukārāma, after initiation by the Lord, overflooded the whole of the Mahārāṣṭra Province with the <i>saṅkīrtana - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ</span></i> movement, and the transcendental flow is still rolling on in the southwestern part of the great Indian peninsula.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13315" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord excavated from South India two very important old literatures, namely the <i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - พรัหมะ-สังหิตา</span></i>* and <i>Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-กรฺณามฺฤต,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - กฤษณะ-กัรณามฤตะ,</span></i> and these two valuable books are authorized studies for the person in the devotional line. The Lord then returned to Purī after His South Indian tour.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13316" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>On His return to Purī, all the anxious devotees of the Lord got back their life, and the Lord remained there with continued pastimes of His transcendental realizations. The most important incident during that time was His granting audience to King Pratāparudra. King Pratāparudra was a great devotee of the Lord, and he considered himself to be one of the servants of the Lord entrusted with sweeping the temple. This submissive attitude of the King was very much appreciated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The King requested both Bhaṭṭācārya and Rāya to arrange his meeting with the Lord. When, however, the Lord was petitioned by His two stalwart devotees, He flatly refused to grant the request, even though it was put forward by personal associates like Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. The Lord maintained that it is dangerous for a <i>sannyāsī - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสี</span></i> to be in intimate touch with worldly money-conscious men and with women. The Lord was an ideal <i>sannyāsī. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสีฯ</span></i> No woman could approach the Lord even to offer respects. Women’s seats were accommodated far away from the Lord. As an ideal teacher and <i>ācārya, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยะ,</span></i> He was very strict in the routine work of a <i>sannyāsī. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สันนยาสีฯ</span></i> Apart from being a divine incarnation, the Lord was an ideal character as a human being. His behavior with other persons was also above suspicion. In His dealing as <i>ācārya, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - อาจารยะ,</span></i> He was harder than the thunderbolt and softer than the rose. One of His associates, Junior Haridāsa, committed a great mistake by lustfully glancing at a young woman. The Lord as Supersoul could detect this lust in the mind of Junior Haridāsa, who was at once banished from the Lord’s association and was never accepted again, even though the Lord was implored to excuse Haridāsa for the mistake. Junior Haridāsa afterwards committed suicide due to being disassociated from the company of the Lord, and the news of suicide was duly related to the Lord. Even at that time the Lord was not forgetful of the offense, and He said that Haridāsa had rightly met with the proper punishment.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13317" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>On the principles of the renounced order of life and discipline, the Lord knew no compromise, and therefore even though He knew that the King was a great devotee, He refused to see the King, only because the King was a dollar-and-cent man. By this example the Lord wanted to emphasize the proper behavior for a transcendentalist. A transcendentalist has nothing to do with women and money. He must always refrain from such intimate relations. The King was, however, favored by the Lord by the expert arrangement of the devotees. This means that the beloved devotee of the Lord can favor a neophyte more liberally than the Lord. Pure devotees, therefore, never commit an offense at the feet of another pure devotee. An offense at the lotus feet of the Lord is sometimes excused by the merciful Lord, but an offense at the feet of a devotee is very dangerous for one who actually wants to make progress in devotional service.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13318" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As long as the Lord remained at Purī, thousands of His devotees used to come to see Him during the Ratha-yātrā car festival of Lord Jagannātha. And during the car festival, the washing of the Guṇḍicā temple under the direct supervision of the Lord was an important function. The Lord’s congregational <i>saṅkīrtana - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ</span></i> movement at Purī was a unique exhibition for the mass of people. That is the way to turn the mass mind towards spiritual realization. The Lord inaugurated this system of mass <i>saṅkīrtana, - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน,</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สังกีรตะนะ,</span></i> and leaders of all countries can take advantage of this spiritual movement in order to keep the mass of people in a pure state of peace and friendship with one another.

The name Kṛṣṇa and the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa are identical. There is no difference in the absolute realm between the name, form or person of the Absolute Truth because in the absolute realm everything is transcendental bliss. There is no difference between the body and the soul for the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Thus He is different from the living entity, who is always different from his outward body. Because of Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental position, it is very difficult for a layman to actually know the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, His holy name and fame, etc. His name, fame, form and pastimes all are one and the same transcendental identity, and they are not knowable by the exercise of the material senses.</p></div>

                        <div id="bb13341" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At Vṛndāvana the Lord took bath in twenty-four important bathing places, or <i>ghātas. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ฆาตสฺฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ฆาตัสฯ</span></i> He traveled to all the twelve important <i>vanas - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">วนสฺ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - วะนัส</span></i> (forests). In these forests all the cows and birds welcomed Him, as if He were their very old friend. The Lord also began to embrace all the trees of those forests, and by doing so He felt the symptoms of transcendental ecstasy. Sometimes He fell unconscious, but He was made to regain consciousness by the chanting of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. The transcendental symptoms that were visible on the body of the Lord during His travel within the forest of Vṛndāvana were all unique and inexplicable, and we have just given a synopsis only.</p></div>

As long as He remained at Vṛndāvana, He made His headquarters at Akrūra-ghāṭa.</p></div>

The Lord acceded to this proposal, and they started for Prayāga. On the way they met with some Pathans, amongst whom there was a learned Moulana. The Lord had some talks with the Moulana and his companions, and the Lord convinced the Moulana that in the Koran also there are descriptions of <i>Bhāgavata-dharma - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภาคะวะตะ-ธัรมะ</span></i> and Kṛṣṇa.

This time the Lord was welcomed by the people of Prayāga more respectfully. Vallabha Bhaṭṭa, who resided on the other bank of Prayāga in the village of Āḍāila, was to receive Him at his place, but while going there the Lord jumped in the River Yamunā. With great difficulty He was picked up in an unconscious state. Finally He visited the headquarters of Vallabha Bhaṭṭa. This Vallabha Bhaṭṭa was one of His chief admirers, but later on he inaugurated his own party, the Vallabha <i>sampradāya. - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สมฺปฺรทายฯ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สัมประทายะฯ</span></i></p></div>

He taught the Gosvāmī the divisions of the living creatures in the 8,400,000 species of life. Then He taught him about the human species. Out of them He discussed the followers of the Vedic principles, out of them the fruitive workers, out of them the empiric philosophers, and out of them the liberated souls. He said that there are only a few who are actually pure devotees of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13346" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was the younger brother of Sanātana Gosvāmī, and when he retired from service he brought with him two boatfuls of gold coins. This means that he brought with him some hundreds of thousands of rupees accumulated by the labor of his service. And before leaving home for Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he divided the wealth as follows: fifty percent for the service of the Lord and His devotees, twenty-five percent for relatives and twenty-five percent for his personal needs in case of emergency. In that way he set an example for all householders.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13347" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord taught the Gosvāmī about devotional service, comparing it to a creeper, and advised him to protect the <i>bhakti - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ภักติ</span></i> creeper most carefully against the mad elephant offense against the pure devotees. In addition, the creeper has to be protected from the desires of sense enjoyment, monistic liberation and perfection of the <i>haṭha-yoga - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">หฐ-โยค</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - หะฐะ-โยคะ</span></i> system.

                        <div id="bb13353" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>2. After that, when there is development of transcendental knowledge of the Lord’s internal opulences, the devotee engages himself in the <i>dāsya - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ทาสฺย</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ทาสยะ</span></i> stage.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13354" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>3. By further development of the <i>dāsya - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">ทาสฺย</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - ทาสยะ</span></i> stage, a respectful fraternity with the Lord develops, and above that a feeling of friendship on equal terms becomes manifest. Both these stages are called the <i>sakhya - <span class="pali" style="color:#990012">สขฺย</span><span class="thai" style="color:#004d00"> - สัขยะ</span></i> stage, or devotional service in friendship.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13355" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>4.

And above this is the stage of conjugal love, and this stage is called the highest stage of love of God, although there is no difference in quality in any of the above stages.
