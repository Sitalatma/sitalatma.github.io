<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata observes various signs, proving Rama's hermitage in the vicinity of his place of search. After proceeding for a distance,
Bharata beholds Rama's hermitage and Rama too seated in the hut, wearing matted locks. Bharata laments on Rama's misfortune of living as an ascetic
Bharata and Shatrughna throw themselves on Rama's feet in salutation. Rama embraces them both.</p>
