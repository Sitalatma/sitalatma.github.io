Śrīla Harikeśa Swami was born on October 23, 1948. In February 1971 he joined ISKCON, and in July he became an initiated disciple of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. During the years that followed, he became Śrīla Prabhupāda's personal servant and secretary, traveling with him in India and around the world.

The year 1976, however, marked a significant turning-point in Śrīla Harikeśa Swami's devotional career - Śrīla Prabhupāda ordered him to print his books in all the languages of the world and to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the European and Soviet communist countries.

That same year Harikeśa Swami was awarded <em>sannyāsa</em> and immediately left for Europe to carry out the instructions of his spiritual master. In December he was appointed GBC and BBT Trustee for Eastern Europe and Germany; and in March 1977, GBC for Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia. Shortly thereafter, Śrīla Prabhupāda ordered him, along with ten other senior disciples, to accept the duties of an initiating <em>guru</em>.

One of the most important missions that Śrīla Prabhupāda left to his disciples is the development of Mayapur City. From the early days of the Puṣpa-samādhi Project, Harikeśa Swami has worked to actualize Śrīla Prabhupāda's far-reaching vision of a wonderful temple and city in Mayapur. And his most recent contribution is a state-of-the-art multimedia presentation of ISKCON that will help raise funds for the Mayapur Project.

Over the years, a distinguishing feature of Harikeśa Swami's mood of service to Śrīla Prabhupāda has been the focused understanding that book production and book distribution are the heart and soul of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Because of his single-minded enthusiasm and dedication in this regard, the North European BBT has steadily increased its productivity and now prints approximately 10 million pieces of transcendental literature in forty languages every year.

Aside from his other engagements, Harikeśa Swami is also writing books. The <em>Varṇāśrama Manifesto for Social Sanity</em> deals with the Vedic concept of social organization. His <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> lectures in Śrīdhāma Mayapur have been published in a book entitled <em>The Thirteenth Chapter</em>, and a series of books elaborating on the other chapters of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā As It </em>Is will be published in the years to come.

On yet another preaching front, Harikeśa Swami has been reaching out to younger generations through his music since the late 1970s. His group RASA came out with nine LPs, and from the mid-1980s, his group BLISS has produced another ten tapes and CDs. From 1990 to 1992 he organized grand tours of the GAURANGA BHAJAN BAND, which was known for its impressive stage acts. At this band's concerts, thousands of people, especially in Eastern Europe, chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> and danced in ecstasy. His latest success has been the best-selling techno CD <em>Rising Sign</em> by SRI HARI. Through this direct, appealing and modern medium, millions of people have heard the transcendental message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
