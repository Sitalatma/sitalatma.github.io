<p class="txt">Bharata does not find his father in the royal palace and goes to meet his mother. He asks his mother about the whereabouts his father.
Kaikeyi informs Bharata about the death of Dasaratha. When Bharata enquired about Rama, Kaikeyi also discloses Rama's exile to the forest along with
Sita and Lakshmana. She also narrates about the two boons she asked the king Dasaratha as well as how the king accepted her boons and sent Rama to
exile. She further advises Bharata to meet the chief of Brahmans like Vasista and others to get himself crowned for the kingdom.</p>
