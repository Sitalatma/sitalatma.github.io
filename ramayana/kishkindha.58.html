<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 58<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Sampāti informs Angada about Seetha, Ravana, and Lanka after narrating his and his brother Jatāyu's flights and plights. Sampāti
narrates what he has seen when Seetha was abducted by Ravana and concludes her to be Seetha for she was incessantly calling for Rama's help. He gives
an account of the lavish city Lanka as an eagle which has seen that city from this shore of ocean, though he cannot fly as the scorching sun
previously burnt both of his wings. Then the returnless monkeys on getting a bare beacon of indication from the lighthouse called Sampāti, they feel
highly rejoiced on the seashore.</p>

to say this verse's second foot, he dies. It will be like this in Aranya Kanda at 3-68-16: <em>putro
vishravasaḥ sākshāt bhratā vaishravaṇasya ca | iti uktvā durlabhān prāṇān mumoca

Lanka...' there would be no Kishkindha canto, nor Vali, nor Sugreeva, nor even Hanuma, and his Sundara Kanda, as Rama would have gone to Lanka,
straightaway. Ramayana is still living as great literary work because it has this kind of melodramatic montages on very many occasions. The family
tree of Ravana is given in the endnote.</p>
