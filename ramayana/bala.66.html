<h3>chapter [Sarga] 66<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Oct 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Legend of Shiva&#39;s bow is narrated as Vishvamitra asks Janaka to show that bow to 
Rama and Lakshmana, as they have come this far to have a glimpse of that great bow. 
Janaka, while narrating its history, makes an offer saying that his daughter Seetha 
will be given in marriage, if only Rama can string the bowstring of Shiva&#39;s bow. 
In the very same sixty-sixth chapter of Kishkindha Kanda, Valmiki narrates the birth 
of Hanuma through Jambavanta, elaborately. But here Valmiki informs through Janaka 
about the nature of birth of Seetha, very concisely, which gave raise to too much 
of debate about this enigmatic Seetha and her birth. Some points are given in the 
endnote.</p>

Comment: Some mms use the word <em>jyeṣṭaḥ</em> instead of <em>Saṣṭa</em> for Nimi 
and then the meaning is that Nimi&#39;s eldest son is Devarāta. Basing on the account

Comment: &#39;Dowry is property or money brought by a bride to her husband&#39; and this 
is familiar throughout the world. In ancient India, there was a counterpart custom 
to this, called <em>kanyā shulkam</em> meaning &#39;some bounty, property or money 
offered by a bridegroom&#39;s family to the bride&#39;s family&#39; since they are getting a 
worthy bride, coming into their family, not just as a mere wife of the bridegroom, 
but to upkeep and promote that family and its progeny. And this dowry or its counterpart 
is not compulsorily be paid in hard cash, but it may be any kind of gifts mutually 
exchanged, which has slowly developed into a mega havoc these days. Here Janaka 
wants the &#39;valour&#39; of his prospective son-in-law as bounty due to him in the marriage 
of Seetha.</p>

Comment: This bow of Shiva will be transported on a wheeled casket-cart with eight 
wheels and drawn by five thousand robust persons. This is narrated in next chapter. 
&#39;It is drawn by drawn by five hundred bulls...&#39; <em>ānanda rāmayana</em> says 
so. In other versions of Ramayana, it is said that many people will pull that casket-cart, 
as one or two persons cannot haul it. Once, when Seetha was playing with other girls, 
their flowery ball of girl&#39;s rugby goes under this cart. None of her girlfriends 
is dare enough to near this bow-casket-cart, since it is a reverential casket-cart. 
But Seetha goes there and pushes that casket-cart aside with her left hand, as though 
it is a garland, and retrieves that flower ball. This capability of Seetha in easy 
handling of Shiva&#39;s bow, becomes a bane to her, when one among the wives of <em>
sapta ṛiṣi</em> &#39;Seven Sages...&#39; issues a curse to Seetha, saying that &#39;Seetha 
will be separated from her husband for some time, of course, for the good of people...&#39; 
So says the tradition.</p>

In the endnote of ch. 56 of Aranya Kanda, some details are given about the enigmatic 
Seetha. Here also some points about her enigmatic birth are presented.</font></p>

<div id="btn6" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Seetha is considered to be the <font color="#B3003A">nature&#39;s nature, Primordeal 
Nature, mahā prakriti</font>, and when the five elements of nature intermingle 
into one, that is the ṃanifest Nature, where the five elements are
<font color="#B3003A">pridhvi, āpa, teja, vāyu, ākāsha</font> &#39;earth, waters, 
fire, air and space...&#39; and there are many theories of their commingling like,
<font color="#B3003A">pachī karaṇa, saptī karaṇa</font> quintuplication, and sevenfold 
commingling etc. The process of creation gives rise to 24 items: 1] empirical or 
fundamental matter, 2] mahat, 3] ahamkāra, 4-8] five subtle elements, 9-13] five 
gross elements, 14] mind, 15-19] five sense organs, 20-24] five motor organs, 25] 
jīva ātma, individual&#39;s soul, 26] Brahman, The Absolute. With these, a created 
living being is created. This is in the case of mortals and their births. But when 
Seetha is found in the furrow all these things have already happened and there is 
no question of human pregnancy to be attached to her. Hence Seetha is to be taken 
as Goddess Lakshmi, who is <font color="#B3003A">parā shakti, Vishnu ṃaya</font> 
and when she has to take an incarnation to become the prime cause to the effect 
of eliminating Ravana, no human activity of reproduction can be attached to such 
beings. If she were to be a human, perhaps she would not have exited from the pyre 
of fire when she self-immolated, after Rama and Ravana war. Some more information, 
though unrelated to Valmiki Ramayana, is given hereunder.</font></p>

is the god&#39;s <font color="#B3003A">ahamata</font> Personality and Activity. Thus 
this Shakti of god is personified in mythological lore and is called Shri or Lakshmi, 
and She is said to manifest herself in, 1] <font color="#B3003A">kriyā shakti</font>, 
Creative Activity and 2] <font color="#B3003A">bhūti shakti</font>, Creation of 
God. Hence Vishnu cannot part with His own personality or creativity i.e.,
<font color="#B3003A">ahamta</font>, which in its feminine form is called
<font color="#B3003A">shrī</font> or <font color="#B3003A">Lakshmi</font>. He therefore 
needs His consort Goddess Lakshmi to be with Him always, untouched by any. Thus, 
Goddess Lakshmi has to accompany Vishnu in all His incarnations, along with other 
paraphernalia like his conch-shell, his quoit and mace, and the thousand headed 
serpent <font color="#B3003A">ādi sheṣa</font> etc. Such a delightful deity Goddess 
Lakshmi is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, but she is fickle 
like ripples <em>lakṣhmī hi toya taranga capalā</em> Lakshmi= Goddess Lakshmi; 
hi= indeed; toya= water; taranga= wave like; capalā= wavering. &#39;Goddess Lakshmi 
is wavering like the waves of water...&#39; <font color="#B3003A">chapala, chanchala, 
asthira</font>, wavering, faltering, unstable, and <font color="#B3003A">māyā, 
mā + yā</font> &#39;whose illusory play she is, or <font color="#B3003A">līla</font> 
play of god. She comes in unnoticeably like the water in a coconut and evaporates 
innocently into thin air, at Her will. Such as she is she is easily grabbed by the 
greedy. Hence none can give birth to her except the ṃother Nature, and hence she 
is called <font color="#B3003A">mahilā ; mahi + lā</font> where
<font color="#B3003A">mahi</font> is earth and <font color="#B3003A">lā ; laḥ khaṇDane 
triṣu ādāne stri</font> because ṃother Earth gave birth to Seetha, Seetha is
<font color="#B3003A">mahila</font> Hence it is better to avoid assuming her to 
be an ordinary lady of an ordinary birth, and she may be viewed either legendarily 
or mythologically, for Valmiki as an epical poet, himself has not chronicled the 
details of her birth.</font></p>

Even Vishnu is deprived of Her in His incarnations, not only in Ramayana but also 
in His <font color="#B3003A">nṛi simha</font> ṃan-Lion incarnation. There, ṃaya 
Lakshmi becomes a tribal woman to bring back the ferocious Lion-ṃan to his original 
form. And in other versions of Ramayana, it is said that Ravana abducted ṃaya Seetha, 
but not real Seetha. &#39;When the real Seetha herself is an enigma, what if Ravana 
abducts real or duplicate copy of that Seetha...&#39; is the brushed aside adjustment. 
In either case, it is <font color="#B3003A">maya, līla</font> illusory power, sport 
of Vishnu together with that of Goddess Lakshmi, cause this enigma. Hence, whenever 
She is thus absconding from Him, Vishnu searches and retrieves Her, for no one in 
Universe can handle her, nor amass all the wealth. The predestined wealth alone 
is enjoyable but nothing more can be amassed. So also are the riches in the present 
day world, come too suddenly and vanish that suddenly. No one is rich ever and anon, 
and on someday every one is likely to see the ups and downs in his graph of riches. 
It is Vishnu that retrives the real wealth back to His abode
<font color="#B3003A">Vaikuntha</font>, and even punishes anyone for his accumulation 
of beyond-the-means-wealth. The burning of Lanka by Hanuma in Sundara Kanda is an 
example to this.</font></p>

The Hindu mythology bases more on its eighteen Purāna-s, each of the six is rendered 
to each of the Hindu Trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. A]
<font color="#B3003A">Vishnu Purāna-s</font> are: - <font color="#B3003D">1] Vishnu, 
2] bhāgavata, 3] nāradīya, 4] garuda, 5] padma. 6] varāha.</font> B]
<font color="#B3003A">Brahma Purāna-s</font> : -<font color="#B3003D">1] Brahma,

2] linga, 3] skanda, 4] agni, 5] matsya, 6] kūrma</font>. In all these Purāna-s 
Goddess Lakshmi is given a laudable place without any sectarian dispute. In the 
Vaishnavaite Purāna-s, Shiva starts telling the efficacy of Vishnu to Goddess Parvati. 
While Shaiva mythology places Goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva, in one half 
of Shiva&#39;s body <font color="#B3003A">artha nārīshvara tattva</font>, and Vaishnavaite 
tradition places Goddess Lakshmi in the heart of Vishnu itself, as if it is a Lotus

While Valmiki Ramayana names Rama as Rama, the Padma Purāna etc., mythological 
texts bring in the Vedic texts and prefix <font color="#B3003A">shrī</font> of
<font color="#B3003A">shrī sūkta</font> of Rig Veda khila 5-87, which is a feminine 
counterpart of <font color="#B3003A">puruṣa sūkta</font> of Rig Veda 10-90, for
<font color="#B3003A">parama purusha</font> i.e., Vishnu or Narayana, and thus call 
Rama of Valmiki as <font color="#B3003A">shrī rāma</font>. Vaishnavaite mythologies 
take hold of these and other Vedic references to Vishnu, and treat Vishnu / Narayana 
and Lakshmi as the inseparable divine couple, who maintain this Universe. The prefix
<font color="#B3003A">shrī</font> means as &#39;one who takes delight in
<font color="#B3003A">shrī</font> i.e., Lakshmi, meaning wealth, wealth of any

eight kinds of wealth are established, to be associated with Goddess Lakshmi. They 
are 1] <font color="#B3003A">ādi Lakshmi</font> Wealth a priori 2]

The play of Goddess Lakshmi in the form of Seetha is Ramayana. As such, her absence 
from Rama caused Rama to travel up to Lanka, annihilate the evil, and retrieve her. 
Seetha herself expresses her anguish about Rama&#39;s indulgence in a Supreme welfare-state, 
than in herself, as ṃahākavi Kalidasa, in his epical poem Raghu Vamsha, and depicts 
what this <font color="#B3003A">bhāgya lakshmi</font> has to say, when Rama, basing

of the plough, and in the end she exits from this world into the same soil, where 
the earth is called <font color="#B3003A">vasundhara</font>, which cleaves under 
Seetha&#39;s feet, and takes Seetha into her womb again. As such, the reason for Seetha 
to be there in that furrow as baby is said to be a vow of Goddess Lakshmi, in her 
earlier incarnation as Vedavati. The mythologies go on to say that Vedavati is the 
brainchild of a sage called Kushadhwaja, and he decides to give Vedavati in marriage 
none less than Vishnu. But in his lifetime, it is an unfulfilled desire. Then Vedavati 
starts a rigorous penance to achieve her father&#39;s wish. When she is at her culmination 
point of her penance, Ravana, passing that way in sky sees this beautiful lady, 
nears, and disturbs her penance. Vedavati coming out of her meditation, curses Ravana 
saying that she will reincarnate herself, to destroy Ravana and his entire dynasty. 
Then she causes a yogic fire and immolates herself in it. And Vedavati is reborn 
as Seetha of Ramayana, in an unusual way.</font></p>

Here <font color="#B3003A">ānanda rāmāyaṇa</font> has an interesting parable. 
Once there was a king named Padmāksha who wanted Lakshmi as his daughter. On practising 
ascesis Vishnu appears and gives a fruit called <font color="#B3003A">mātulunga 
phala</font>, and girl emerges from out of that fruit, and she is named as
<font color="#B3003A">Padma</font>. But greedy to possess her, all the wooing kings 
war with Padmāksha and his entire family is ruined and Padma jumps into fire and 
self immolates herself. Later when Vishnu&#39;s <font color="#B3003A">māya</font> comes 
out of an altar of fire, sits in her meditation, Ravana sees her and wants to abduct 
her. Of course, she is otherwise said to be Vedavati in other texts. But again, 
she enters the fire altar and reduces herself to ashes. Even then, Ravana searches 
in those ashes for her. In there, he gets five diamonds of high quality. He comes 
to Lanka and paces those diamonds in a casket and jovially presents them to his 
wife ṃandodari. When ṃandodari could not lift the casket Ravana lifts it and opens 
its lid, as he lifted ṃt. Kailash. When the casket is opened, ṃandodari finds a 
baby girl in it and recognises her to be Goddess Lakshmi. Then they consult their 
teachers about that baby&#39;s arrival. Those teaches wishing good for Ravana, advise 
to get rid off this girl immediately, for he is Goddess Lakshmi, arrived here only 
to end Ravana and his dynasty. Then ṃandodari orders his servants to carry away 
this baby in a casket by an aircraft and get rid off it.</font></p>

<div id="btn17" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
But Ravana rushes after the girl with a sword, to put that girl to sword. Empress 
ṃandodari pacifies Ravana and says &quot;Why purchase a later time death now itself at 
the hand of this baby... let that the casket be buried...&quot; Ravana agrees. ṃandodari 
also curses this girl saying, <font color="#B3003A">&quot;this faithless girl, [for wealth 
is unfaithful,] will thrive only in a house, where the householder has his senses 
conquered, and who being an emperor lives like a perfect hermit, and who though 
wealthy and supreme by himself, will care nothing for the riches but view whole 
of the world and people as his own soul, with an impartial attitude...&quot;</font> Thus 
this casket is buried in the fields of King Janaka&#39;s empire by demons, clandestinely. 
ṃandodari thought that such a person is an impossibility to take birth in this mortal 
world, to foster this buried girl, and thus presumed her curse to be twisty. But 
there is King Janaka with all the above attributes. A king without ego, wealthy 
but living simple, childless, yet does not crave for one, like King Dasharatha. 
Hence, he is called <font color="#B3003A">rājarṣi</font> a saintly king. Seetha&#39;s 
birth is to be limitedly understood, as said by Janaka in this chapter. Otherwise, 
the nuances about the birth of Seetha are to be viewed through the viewfinders of 
mythologies, legends, and above all, through the viewfinders of tradition... but 
not in the vast of epical poetry, as Valmiki himself has undocumented it...</font></p>
