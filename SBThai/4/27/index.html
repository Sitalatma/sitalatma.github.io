        <div id="bb34019" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>After hunting in the forest, King Purañjana returned home, and after refreshing himself by taking a bath and eating nice food, he searched for his wife. When he saw her lying down on the ground without a bed, as if neglected, and devoid of any proper dress, he became very much aggrieved. He then became attracted to her and began to enjoy her company. A living entity is similarly engaged in the material world in sinful activities. These sinful activities may be compared to King Purañjana’s hunting in the forest.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34020" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A sinful life can be counteracted by various processes of religion such as <i>yajña, vrata - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญ, วฺรต</span></i> and <i>dāna - <span style="color:#990012">ทาน</span></i> — that is, the performance of sacrifices, the taking of a vow for some religious ritual, and the giving of charity. In this way one may become free from the reactions of sinful life and at the same time awaken his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness. By coming home, taking his bath, eating nice foodstuffs, getting refreshed and searching out his wife, King Purañjana came to his good consciousness in his family life. In other words, a systematic family life as enjoined in the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> is better than an irresponsible sinful life. If a husband and wife combine together in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and live together peacefully, that is very nice. However, if a husband becomes too much attracted by his wife and forgets his duty in life, the implications of materialistic life will again resume. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has therefore recommended, <i>anāsaktasya viṣayān - <span style="color:#990012">อนาสกฺตสฺย วิษยานฺ</span></i> (<i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-รสามฺฤต-สินฺธุ</span></i> 1.2.255). Without being attached by sex, the husband and wife may live together for the advancement of spiritual life. The husband should engage in devotional service, and the wife should be faithful and religious according to the Vedic injunctions. Such a combination is very good. However, if the husband becomes too much attracted to the wife due to sex, the position becomes very dangerous. Women in general are very much sexually inclined. Indeed, it is said that a woman’s sex desire is nine times stronger than a man’s. It is therefore a man’s duty to keep a woman under his control by satisfying her, giving her ornaments, nice food and clothes, and engaging her in religious activities. Of course, a woman should have a few children and in this way not be disturbing to the man. Unfortunately, if the man becomes attracted to the woman simply for sex enjoyment, then family life becomes abominable.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34021" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The great politician Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has said, <i>bhāryā rūpavatī śatruḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ภารฺยา รูปวตี ศตฺรุฮ</span></i>: a beautiful wife is an enemy. Of course every woman in the eyes of her husband is very beautiful. Others may see her as not very beautiful, but the husband, being very much attracted to her, sees her always as very beautiful. If the husband sees the wife as very beautiful, it is to be assumed that he is too much attracted to her. This attraction is the attraction of sex. The whole world is captivated by the two modes of material nature <i>rajo-guṇa - <span style="color:#990012">รโช-คุณ</span></i> and <i>tamo-guṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">ตโม-คุณ,</span></i> passion and ignorance. Generally women are very much passionate and are less intelligent; therefore somehow or other a man should not be under the control of their passion and ignorance. By performing <i>bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> or devotional service, a man can be raised to the platform of goodness. If a husband situated in the mode of goodness can control his wife, who is in passion and ignorance, the woman is benefited. Forgetting her natural inclination for passion and ignorance, the woman becomes obedient and faithful to her husband, who is situated in goodness. Such a life becomes very welcome. The intelligence of the man and woman may then work very nicely together, and they can make a progressive march toward spiritual realization. Otherwise, the husband, coming under the control of the wife, sacrifices his quality of goodness and becomes subservient to the qualities of passion and ignorance. In this way the whole situation becomes polluted.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34022" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The conclusion is that a household life is better than a sinful life devoid of responsibility, but if in the household life the husband becomes subordinate to the wife, involvement in materialistic life again becomes prominent. In this way a man’s material bondage becomes enhanced. Because of this, according to the Vedic system, after a certain age a man is recommended to abandon his family life for the stages of <i>vānaprastha - <span style="color:#990012">วานปฺรสฺตฺห</span></i> and <i>sannyāsa. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส.</span></i></p></div>

She may even sometimes wear flowers in her hair. Women especially dress themselves up in the evening because the husband comes home in the evening after working hard all day. It is the duty of the wife to dress herself up very nicely so that when her husband returns home he becomes attracted by her dress and cleanliness and thus becomes satisfied. In other words, the wife is the inspiration of all good intelligence. Upon seeing one’s wife dressed nicely, one can think very soberly about family business. When a person is too anxious about family affairs, he cannot discharge his family duties nicely. A wife is therefore supposed to be an inspiration and should keep the husband’s intelligence in good order so that they can combinedly prosecute the affairs of family life without impediment.</p></div>

        <div id="bb34032" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>pramadā - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรมทา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรมทา</span></i> in this verse is very significant. A beautiful wife is certainly enlivening to her husband, but at the same time is the cause of degradation. The word <i>pramadā</i> means “enlivening” as well as “maddening.” Generally a householder does not take the passing of days and nights very seriously. A person in ignorance takes it as the usual course that days come, and after the days, the nights come. This is the law of material nature. But a man in ignorance does not know that when the sun rises early in the morning it begins to take away the balance of his life. Thus day after day the span of one’s life is reduced, and forgetting the duty of human life, the foolish man simply remains in the company of his wife and enjoys her in a secluded place. Such a condition is called <i>apakṛṣṭa-cetana, - <span style="color:#990012">อปกฺฤษฺฏ-เจตน,</span></i> or degraded consciousness. Human consciousness should be used for elevation to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But when a person is too much attracted to his wife and family affairs, he does not take Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. He thus becomes degraded, not knowing that he cannot buy back even a second of his life in return for millions of dollars. The greatest loss in life is passing time without understanding Kṛṣṇa. Every moment of our lives should be utilized properly, and the proper use of life is to increase devotional service to the Lord. Without devotional service to the Lord, the activities of life become simply a waste of time (<i>śrama eva hi kevalam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรม เอว หิ เกวลมฺ</span></i>). Simply by becoming “dutiful” we do not make any profit in life. As confirmed in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.2.8):</p></div>

        <div id="bb34039" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Human life is meant for self-realization. First of all one has to realize his own self, which is described in this verse as <i>nijam. - <span style="color:#990012">นิชมฺ.</span></i> Then he has to understand or realize the Supersoul, or Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, when one becomes too much materially attached, he takes a woman to be everything. This is the basic principle of material attachment. In such a condition, one cannot realize his own self or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (5.5.2) it is therefore said, <i>mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam. - <span style="color:#990012">มหตฺ-เสวาํ ทฺวารมฺ อาหุรฺ วิมเุกฺตสฺ ตโม-ทฺวารํ โยษิตาํ สงฺคิ-สงฺคมฺ.</span></i> If one associates with <i>mahātmās, - <span style="color:#990012">มหาตฺมาสฺ,</span></i> or devotees, his path of liberation is opened. But if one becomes too much attached to women or to persons who are also attached to women — that is, attached to women directly or indirectly — he opens the <i>tamo-dvāram, - <span style="color:#990012">ตโม-ทฺวารมฺ,</span></i> the door to the darkest region of hellish life.</p></div>

In the modern age the consciousness of people is too much covered by wine, women and flesh. Consequently, people are completely unable to make any progress in self-realization. The first step of self-realization is to know oneself as spirit soul apart from the body. In the second stage of self-realization, one comes to know that every soul, every individual living entity, is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul, Paramātmā, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

They do not know that without self-realization they suffer the greatest loss in the human form of life. Thinking of a woman always within one’s heart is tantamount to lying down with a woman on a valuable bedstead. The heart is the bedstead, and it is the most valuable bedstead. When a man thinks of women and money, he lies down and rests on the arms of his beloved woman or wife. In this way he overindulges in sex life and thus becomes unfit for self-realization.</p></div>

</div>    

        <div id="bb34050" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse Śrīla Govinda dāsa actually says that there is no bliss in the enjoyment of youthful life. In youth a person becomes very lusty to enjoy all kinds of sense objects. The sense objects are form, taste, smell, touch and sound. The modern scientific method, or advancement of scientific civilization, encourages the enjoyment of these five senses. The younger generation is very pleased to see a beautiful form, to hear radio messages of material news and sense gratificatory songs, to smell nice scents and nice flowers, and to touch the soft body or breasts of a young woman and gradually touch the sex organs. All of this is also very pleasing to the animals; therefore in human society there are restrictions in the enjoyment of the five sense objects. If one does not follow, he becomes exactly like an animal.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34051" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Thus in this verse it is specifically stated, <i>kāma-kaśmala-cetasaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">กาม-กศฺมล-เจตสฮ:</span></i> the consciousness of King Purañjana was polluted by lusty desires and sinful activities. In the previous verse it is stated that Purañjana, although advanced in consciousness, lay down on a very soft bed with his wife. This indicates that he indulged too much in sex. The words <i>navaṁ vayaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">นวํ วยฮ</span></i> are also significant in this verse. They indicate the period of youth from age sixteen to thirty. These thirteen or fifteen years of life are years in which one can very strongly enjoy the senses. When one comes to this age he thinks that life will go on and that he will simply continue enjoying his senses. But “time and tide wait for no man” — the span of youth expires very quickly. One who wastes his life simply by committing sinful activities in youth immediately becomes disappointed and disillusioned when the brief period of youth is over. The material enjoyments of youth are especially pleasing to a person who has no spiritual training. If one is trained only according to the bodily conception of life, he simply leads a disappointed life because bodily sense enjoyment finishes within forty years or so. After forty years, one simply leads a disillusioned life because he has no spiritual knowledge. For such a person, the expiration of youth occurs in half a moment. Thus King Purañjana’s pleasure, which he took in lying down with his wife, expired very quickly.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34052" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p><i>Kāma-kaśmala-cetasaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">กาม-กศฺมล-เจตสฮ</span></i> also indicates that unrestricted sense enjoyment is not allowed in the human form of life by the laws of nature. If one enjoys his senses unrestrictedly, he leads a sinful life. The animals do not violate the laws of nature. For example, the sex impulse in animals is very strong during certain months of the year. The lion is very powerful. He is a flesh-eater and is very strong, but he enjoys sex only once in a year. Similarly, according to religious injunctions a man is restricted to enjoying sex only once in a month, after the menstrual period of the wife, and if the wife is pregnant, he is not allowed sex life at all. That is the law for human beings. A man is allowed to keep more than one wife because he cannot enjoy sex when the wife is pregnant. If he wants to enjoy sex at such a time, he may go to another wife who is not pregnant. These are laws mentioned in the <i>Manu-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">มนุ-สํหิตา</span></i> and other scriptures.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34053" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>These laws and scriptures are meant for human beings. As such, if one violates these laws, he becomes sinful. The conclusion is that unrestricted sense enjoyment means sinful activities. Illicit sex is sex that violates the laws given in the scriptures. When one violates the laws of the scriptures, or the <i>Vedas, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> he commits sinful activities. One who is engaged in sinful activities cannot change his consciousness. Our real function is to change our consciousness from <i>kaśmala, - <span style="color:#990012">กศฺมล,</span></i> sinful consciousness, to Kṛṣṇa, the supreme pure. As confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (<i>paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān - <span style="color:#990012">ปรํ พฺรหฺม ปรํ ธาม ปวิตฺรํ ปรมํ ภวานฺ</span></i>), Kṛṣṇa is the supreme pure, and if we change our consciousness from material enjoyment to Kṛṣṇa, we become purified. This is the process recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the process of <i>ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam, - <span style="color:#990012">เจโต-ทรฺปณ-มารฺชนมฺ,</span></i> cleansing the mirror of the heart.</p></div>

Actually every man follows a similar process. If one lives for one hundred years at the utmost, in his family life he simply begets children up to the age of fifty. Unfortunately at the present moment people do not live even a hundred years; nonetheless they beget children up to the age of sixty. Another point is that formerly people used to beget one hundred to two hundred sons and daughters. As will be evident from the next verse, King Purañjana not only begot 1,100 sons but also 110 daughters. At the present moment no one can produce such huge quantities of children. Instead, mankind is very busy checking the increase of population by contraceptive methods.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34059" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>We do not find in Vedic literatures that they ever used contraceptive methods, although they were begetting hundreds of children. Checking population by contraceptive method is another sinful activity, but in this Age of Kali people have become so sinful that they do not care for the resultant reactions of their sinful lives. King Purañjana lay down with his wife, Purañjanī, and begot a large number of children, and there is no mention in these verses that he used contraceptive methods. According to the Vedic scriptures the contraceptive method should be restraint in sex life. It is not that one should indulge in unrestricted sex life and avoid children by using some method to check pregnancy. If a man is in good consciousness, he consults with his religious wife, and as a result of this consultation, with intelligence, one advances in his ability to estimate the value of life. In other words, if one is fortunate enough to have a good, conscientious wife, he can decide by mutual consultation that human life is meant for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and not for begetting a large number of children. Children are called <i>pariṇāma, - <span style="color:#990012">ปริณาม,</span></i> or by-products, and when one consults his good intelligence he can see that his by-products should be the expansion of his Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>

It is the duty of a father and mother to arrange for the marriage of their sons and daughters. That is the obligation in Vedic society. Sons and daughters should not be allowed freedom to intermingle with the opposite sex unless they are married.

        <div id="bb34076" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>We must remember that Purañjana is the living entity, and the city Pañcāla is the body. The body is the field of activity for the living entity, as stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span>: - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา:</span></i> <i>kṣetra - <span style="color:#990012">เกฺษตฺร</span>-kṣetrajña. - <span style="color:#990012">เกฺษตฺร-เกฺษตฺรชฺญ.</span></i> There are two constituents: one is the living entity (<i>kṣetra-jña - <span style="color:#990012">เกฺษตฺร-ชฺญ</span></i>), and the other is the body of the living entity (<i>kṣetra</i>). Any living entity can know that he is covered by the body if he only contemplates the body a little bit. Just with a little contemplation he can come to understand that the body is his possession. One can understand this by practical experience and by the authority of the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> In <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> (2.13) it is said, <i>dehino ’smin yathā dehe: - <span style="color:#990012">เทหิโน ′สฺมินฺ ยตฺหา เทเห:</span></i> the proprietor of the body, the soul, is within the body. The body is taken as the <i>pañcāla-deśa, - <span style="color:#990012">ปญฺจาล-เทศ,</span></i> or the field of activities wherein the living entity can enjoy the senses in their relationship to the five sense objects, namely <i>gandha, rasa, rūpa, sparśa - <span style="color:#990012">คนฺธ, รส, รูป, สฺปรฺศ</span></i> and <i>śabda - <span style="color:#990012">ศพฺท</span></i> — that is, sense objects made out of earth, water, fire, air and sky. Within this material world, covered by the material body of subtle and gross matter, every living entity creates actions and reactions, which are herein known allegorically as sons and grandsons. There are two kinds of actions and reactions — namely pious and impious. In this way our material existence becomes coated by different actions and reactions. In this regard, Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura states:</p></div>
    
        <div id="bb34077" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa,<br />amṛta baliyā yebā khāya<br />nānā yoni sadā phire, kadarya bhakṣaṇa kare,<br />tāra janma adhaḥ-pāte yāya</i></em></div>

</div>    

        <div id="bb34078" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“Fruitive activities and mental speculation are simply cups of poison. Whoever drinks of them, thinking them to be nectar, must struggle very hard life after life, in different types of bodies. Such a person eats all kinds of nonsense and becomes condemned by his activities of so-called sense enjoyment.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34079" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Thus the field of action and reactions, by which one’s descendants are increased, begins with sex life. Purañjana increased his whole family by begetting sons who in their turn begot grandsons. Thus the living entity, being inclined toward sexual gratification, becomes involved in many hundreds and thousands of actions and reactions. In this way he remains within the material world simply for the purpose of sense gratification and transmigrates from one body to another. His process of reproducing so many sons and grandsons results in so-called societies, nations, communities and so on. All these communities, societies, dynasties and nations simply expand from sex life. As stated by Prahlāda Mahārāja, <i>yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham - <span style="color:#990012">ยนฺ ไมตฺหุนาทิ-คฺฤหเมธิ-สุขํ หิ ตุจฺฉมฺ</span></i> (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 7.9.45). A <i>gṛhamedhī - <span style="color:#990012">คฺฤหเมธี</span></i> is one who wants to remain within this material existence. This means that he wants to remain within this body or society and enjoy friendship, love and community. His only enjoyment is in increasing the number of sex enjoyers. He enjoys sex and produces children, who in their turn marry and produce grandchildren. The grandchildren also marry and in their turn produce great-grandchildren. In this way the entire earth becomes overpopulated, and then suddenly there are reactions provoked by material nature in the form of war, famine, pestilence, earthquakes, etc. Thus the entire population is again extinguished simply to be re-created. This process is explained in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (8.19) as repeated creation and annihilation: <i>bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate. - <span style="color:#990012">ภูตฺวา ภูตฺวา ปฺรลียเต.</span></i> Due to a lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all this creation and annihilation is going on under the name of human civilization. This cycle continues due to man’s lack of knowledge of the soul and the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>

        <div id="bb34084" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse the word <i>riktha-hāreṣu, - <span style="color:#990012">ริกฺตฺห-หาเรษุ,</span></i> meaning “plunderers of wealth,” is very significant. One’s sons, grandsons and other descendants are ultimately plunderers of one’s accumulated wealth. There are many celebrated businessmen and industrialists who produce great wealth and are highly praised by the public, but all their money is ultimately plundered by their sons and grandsons. In India we have actually seen one industrialist who, like King Purañjana, was very much sexually inclined and had a half dozen wives. Each of these wives had a separate establishment that necessitated the expenditure of several thousands of rupees. When I was engaged in talking with him, I saw that he was very busy trying to secure money so that all his sons and daughters would get at least five hundred thousand rupees each. Thus such industrialists, businessmen or <i>karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> are called <i>mūḍhas - <span style="color:#990012">มูฒสฺ</span></i> in the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> They work very hard, accumulate money, and are satisfied to see that this money is plundered by their sons and grandsons. Such people do not want to return their wealth to its actual owner. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (5.29), <i>bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram: - <span style="color:#990012">โภกฺตารํ ยชฺญ-ตปสาํ สรฺว-โลก-มเหศฺวรมฺ:</span></i> the real proprietor of all wealth is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the actual enjoyer. So-called earners of money are those who simply know tricks by which they can take away God’s money under the guise of business and industry. After accumulating this money, they enjoy seeing it plundered by their sons and grandsons. This is the materialistic way of life. In materialistic life one is encaged within the body and deluded by false egoism. Thus one thinks, “I am this body,” “I am a human being,” “I am an American,” “I am an Indian.” This bodily conception is due to false ego. Being deluded by false ego, one identifies himself with a certain family, nation or community. In this way one’s attachment for the material world grows deeper and deeper. Thus it becomes very difficult for the living entity to extricate himself from his entanglement. Such people are graphically described in the Sixteenth Chapter of <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> (16.13-15) in this way:</p></div>

Actually the entire description was figuratively describing the activities of King Prācīnabarhiṣat. In this verse Nārada frankly says “like you” (<i>yathā bhavān - <span style="color:#990012">ยตฺหา ภวานฺ</span></i>), which indicates that King Purañjana is none other than King Prācīnabarhiṣat himself. Being a great Vaiṣṇava, Nārada Muni wanted to stop animal-killing in sacrifices. He knew that if he tried to stop the King from performing sacrifices, the King would not hear him. Therefore he is describing the life of Purañjana. But in this verse he first discloses the intention, although not fully, by saying “like you.” Generally the <i>karmīs, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ,</span></i> who are attached to increasing descendants, have to perform so many sacrifices and worship so many demigods for future generations and satisfy so many leaders, politicians, philosophers and scientists to make things go on properly for future generations. The so-called scientists are very eager to see that future generations will live very comfortably, and as such they are trying to find different means of generating energy to drive locomotives, cars, airplanes and so on. Now they are exhausting the petroleum supply. These activities are described in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (2.41):</p></div>

Modern civilization is centered around animal-killing. <i>Karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> are advertising that without eating meat, their vitamin value or vitality will be reduced; so to keep oneself fit to work hard, one must eat meat, and to digest meat, one must drink liquor, and to keep the balance of drinking wine and eating meat, one must have sufficient sexual intercourse to keep fit to work very hard like an ass.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34098" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are two ways of animal-killing. One way is in the name of religious sacrifices. All the religions of the world — except the Buddhists — have a program for killing animals in places of worship. According to Vedic civilization, the animal-eaters are recommended to sacrifice a goat in the temple of Kālī under certain restrictive rules and regulations and eat the flesh. Similarly, they are recommended to drink wine by worshiping the goddess Caṇḍikā. The purpose is restriction. People have given up all this restriction. Now they are regularly opening wine distilleries and slaughterhouses and indulging in drinking alcohol and eating flesh. A Vaiṣṇava <i>ācārya - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย</span></i> like Nārada Muni knows very well that persons engaged in such animal-killing in the name of religion are certainly becoming involved in the cycle of birth and death, forgetting the real aim of life: to go home, back to Godhead.</p></div>

        <div id="bb34111" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse the words <i>priya - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺริย</span>-yoṣit - <span style="color:#990012">โยษิตฺ</span>ām - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺริย-โยษิตามฺ</span></i> and <i>apriyaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">อปฺริยฮ</span></i> are very significant. The word <i>yoṣit</i> means “woman,” and <i>priya</i> means “dear” or “pleasing.” Death is not very much welcome for those who are too much attached to material enjoyment, which culminates in sex. There is an instructive story in this connection: Once when a saintly person was passing on his way, he met a prince, the son of a king, and he blessed him, saying, “My dear prince, may you live forever.” The sage next met a saintly person and said to him, “You may either live or die.” Eventually the sage met a <i>brahmacārī - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมจารี</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมจารี</span></i> devotee, and he blessed him, saying, “My dear devotee, you may die immediately.” Finally the sage met a hunter, and he blessed him, saying, “Neither live nor die.” The point is that those who are very sensual and are engaged in sense gratification do not wish to die. Generally a prince has enough money to enjoy his senses; therefore the great sage said that he should live forever, for as long as he lived he could enjoy life, but after his death he would go to hell. Since the <i>brahmacārī</i> devotee was leading a life of severe austerities and penances in order to be promoted back to Godhead, the sage said that he should die immediately so that he need not continue to labor hard and could instead go back home, back to Godhead. A saintly person may either live or die, for during his life he is engaged in serving the Lord and after his death he also serves the Lord. Thus this life and the next are the same for a saintly devotee, for in both he serves the Lord. Since the hunter lives a very ghastly life due to killing animals, and since he will go to hell when he dies, he is advised to neither live nor die.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34112" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>King Purañjana finally arrived at the point of old age. In old age the senses lose their strength, and although an old man desires to enjoy his senses, and especially sex life, he is very miserable because his instruments of enjoyment no longer function. Such sensualists are never prepared for death. They simply want to live on and on and extend their life by so-called scientific advancement. Some foolish Russian scientists also claim that they are going to make man immortal through scientific advancement. Under the leadership of such crazy fellows, civilization is going on. Cruel death, however, comes and takes all of them away despite their desire to live forever. This type of mentality was exhibited by Hiraṇyakaśipu, but when the time was ripe, the Lord personally killed him within a second.</p></div>

Since time and tide wait for no man, time is herein called Caṇḍavega, which means “very swiftly passing away.” As time passes, it is calculated in terms of years. One year contains 360 days, and the soldiers of Caṇḍavega herein mentioned represent these days. Time passes swiftly; Caṇḍavega’s powerful soldiers of Gandharvaloka very swiftly carry away all the days of our life. As the sun rises and sets, it snatches away the balance of our life span. Thus as each day passes, each one of us loses some of life’s duration. It is therefore said that the duration of one’s life cannot be saved. But if one is engaged in devotional service, his time cannot be taken away by the sun. As stated in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (2.3.17), <i>āyur harati vai puṁsām udyann astaṁ ca yann asau. - <span style="color:#990012">อายุรฺ หรติ ไว ปุํสามฺ อุทฺยนฺนฺ อสฺตํ จ ยนฺนฺ อสะอุ.</span></i> The conclusion is that if one wants to make himself immortal, he should give up sense gratification.

        <div id="bb34123" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The days have been compared to the soldiers of Caṇḍavega. Night is generally a time for sex enjoyment. Days are considered to be white, and nights are considered to be black, or, from another point of view, there are two kinds of nights — black nights and white nights. All these days and nights combine to pass away our span of life and everything we manufacture for sense gratification. Material activity means manufacturing things for sense gratification. Scientists are conducting research to find out how we can satisfy our senses more and more elaborately. In this Kali-yuga, the demoniac mentality is employed in manufacturing various machines to facilitate the process of sense gratification. There are so many machines for ordinary household activities. There are machines for washing dishes, cleansing the floor, shaving, clipping hair — today everything is done by machine. All these facilities for sense gratification are described in this verse as <i>sarva-kāma-vinirmitām. - <span style="color:#990012">สรฺว-กาม-วินิรฺมิตามฺ.</span></i> The time factor, however, is so strong that not only is our span of life being expended, but all the machines and facilities for sense gratification are deteriorating. Therefore in this verse the word <i>vilumpanti, - <span style="color:#990012">วิลุมฺปนฺติ,</span></i> “plundering,” is used. Everything is being plundered from the very beginning of our lives.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb34124" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This plundering of our possessions and life span begins with the day of our birth. One day will come when death will finish everything, and the living entity will have to enter another body to begin another chapter of life and again begin the cycle of material sense gratification. Prahlāda Mahārāja describes this process as <i>punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām - <span style="color:#990012">ปุนฮ ปุนศฺ จรฺวิต-จรฺวณานามฺ</span></i> (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 7.5.30): materialistic life means chewing the chewed again and again. The central point of material life is sense gratification. In different types of bodies, the living entity enjoys various senses, and through creating various types of facilities, he chews the chewed. Whether we squeeze sugar out of the sugarcane with our teeth or a machine, the result is the same — sugarcane juice. We may discover many ways to squeeze the juice out of the sugarcane, but the result is the same.</p></div>

        <div id="bb34141" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The living entity resides within the body and struggles for existence with the limbs of the body, which are referred to here as citizens and friends. One can struggle alone with many soldiers for some time, but not for all time. The living entity within the body can struggle up to the limit of a hundred years with good luck, but after that it is not possible to prolong the struggle. Thus the living entity submits and falls victim. In this regard, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, <i>vṛddha kāla āola saba sukha bhāgala: - <span style="color:#990012">วฺฤทฺธ กาล อาล สพ สุข ภาคล:</span></i> when one becomes old, it becomes impossible to enjoy material happiness. Generally people think that religion and piety come at the end of life, and at this time one generally becomes meditative and takes to some so-called yogic process to relax in the name of meditation. Meditation, however, is simply a farce for those who have enjoyed life in sense gratification. As described in the Sixth Chapter of <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> meditation (<i>dhyāna, dhāraṇā - <span style="color:#990012">ธฺยาน, ธารณา</span></i>) is a difficult subject matter that one has to learn from his very youth. To meditate, one must restrain himself from all kinds of sense gratification. Unfortunately, meditation has now become a fashion for those who are overly addicted to sensual things. Such meditation is defeated by the struggle for existence. Sometimes such meditative processes pass for transcendental meditation. King Purañjana, the living entity, being thus victimized by the hard struggle for existence, took to transcendental meditation with his friends and relatives.</p></div>

The government is top-heavy, and without increasing taxes the government cannot maintain itself. When taxes are collected they are utilized for the sense gratification of the government officials. Such irresponsible politicians forget that there is a time when death will come to take away all their sense gratification. Some of them are convinced that after life everything is finished. This atheistic theory was conceived long ago by a philosopher called Cārvāka. Cārvāka recommended that man should live very opulently by either begging, borrowing or stealing. He also maintained that one should not be afraid of death, the next life, the past life or an impious life because after the body is burnt to ashes everything is finished. This is the philosophy of those who are too much materially addicted. Such philosophizing will not save one from the danger of death, nor will it save one from an abominable afterlife.</p></div>

Consequently, no one likes old age, or <i>jarā. - <span style="color:#990012">ชรา.</span></i> Thus Jarā, as the daughter of Time, is known as a most unfortunate daughter. She was, however, at one time accepted by a great king, Yayāti. Yayāti was cursed by his father-in-law, Śukrācārya, to accept her. When Śukrācārya’s daughter was married to King Yayāti, one of her friends named Śarmiṣṭhā went with her. Later King Yayāti became very much attached to Śarmiṣṭhā, and Śukrācārya’s daughter complained to her father. Consequently, Śukrācārya cursed King Yayāti to become prematurely old. King Yayāti had five youthful sons, and he begged all his sons to exchange their youth for his old age. No one agreed except the youngest son, whose name was Pūru. Upon accepting Yayāti’s old age, Pūru was given the kingdom. It is said that two of Yayāti’s other sons, being disobedient to their father, were given kingdoms outside of India, most probably Turkey and Greece. The purport is that one can accumulate wealth and all kinds of material opulences but during old age one cannot enjoy them. Although Pūru attained his father’s kingdom, he could not enjoy all the opulence, for he had sacrificed his youth. One should not wait for old age in order to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Due to the invalidity of old age, one cannot make progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however opulent he may be materially.</p></div>

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī began their spiritual lives at a very old age — that is, after they retired from their occupations and family lives — yet they presented many valuable literatures for the advancement of spiritual life. This is confirmed by Śrīla Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, who praised the Gosvāmīs in this way:</p></div>

Thus they are honored all over the three worlds, and they are worth taking shelter of because they are absorbed in the mood of the <i>gopīs - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ</span></i> and are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.”</p></div>

This is because a devotee follows the instructions and the determination of Nārada Muni. All devotees are in the disciplic succession stemming from Nārada Muni because they worship the Deity according to Nārada Muni’s direction, namely the <i>Nārada-pañcarātra, - <span style="color:#990012">นารท-ปญฺจราตฺร,</span></i> or the <i>pāñcarātrika-vidhi - <span style="color:#990012">ปาญฺจราตฺริก-วิธิ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปาญฺจราตฺริก-วิธิ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ปาญฺจราตฺริก-วิธิ.</span></i> A devotee follows the principles of <i>pāñcarātrika-vidhi</i> as well as <i>bhāgavata-vidhi. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-วิธิ.</span></i> <i>Bhāgavata-vidhi - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-วิธิ</span></i> includes preaching work — <i>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณํ กีรฺตนํ วิโษฺณฮ</span></i> — the hearing and chanting of the glories of Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The <i>pāñcarātrika-vidhi</i> includes <i>arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam. - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจนํ วนฺทนํ ทาสฺยํ สขฺยมฺ อาตฺม-นิเวทนมฺ.</span></i> Because a devotee rigidly follows the instructions of Nārada Muni, he has no fear of old age, disease or death. Apparently a devotee may grow old, but he is not subjected to the symptoms of defeat experienced by a common man in old age. Consequently, old age does not make a devotee fearful of death, as a common man is fearful of death. When <i>jarā,</i> or old age, takes shelter of a devotee, Kālakanyā diminishes the devotee’s fear. A devotee knows that after death he is going back home, back to Godhead; therefore he has no fear of death. Thus instead of depressing a devotee, advanced age helps him become fearless and thus happy.</p></div>

Although Kālakanyā means invalidity or old age, Yavana-rāja wanted to serve Kṛṣṇa by introducing Kālakanyā everywhere. Thus a sane person, by attaining old age, will become fearful of death. Foolish people engage in material activities as if they will live forever and enjoy material advancement, but actually there is no material advancement. Under illusion people think that material opulence will save them, but although there has been much advancement in material science, the problems of human society — birth, death, old age and disease — are still unsolved. Nonetheless foolish scientists are thinking that they have advanced materially. When Kālakanyā, the invalidity of old age, attacks them, they become fearful of death, if they are sane. Those who are insane simply do not care for death, nor do they know what is going to happen after death. They are under the wrong impression that after death there is no life, and consequently they act very irresponsibly in this life and enjoy unrestricted sense gratification. For an intelligent person, the appearance of old age is an impetus to spiritual life. People naturally fear impending death. The King of the Yavanas tried to utilize Kālakanyā for this purpose.</p></div>

According to Ṛṣabhadeva, such activities are inauspicious because they force one to accept an abominable body in the next life. Everyone can experience that although we try to keep the body in a comfortable position, it is always giving pain and is subjected to the threefold miseries. Otherwise, why are there so many hospitals, welfare boards and insurance establishments? Actually, in this world there is no happiness. People are simply engaged trying to counteract unhappiness. Foolish people accept unhappiness as happiness; therefore the King of the Yavanas decided to attack such foolish people imperceptibly by old age, disease, and ultimately death. Of course, after death there must be birth; therefore Yavana-rāja thought it wise to kill all the <i>karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> through the agency of Kālakanyā and thus try to make them aware that materialistic advancement is not actually advancement. Every living entity is a spiritual being, and consequently without spiritual advancement the human form of life is ruined.</p></div>

        <div id="bb34217" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kālakanyā was sent by Nārada Muni to Yavana-rāja so that she might become his wife, but instead of accepting her as his wife, Yavana-rāja accepted her as his sister. Those who do not follow the Vedic principles are unrestricted as far as sex life is concerned. Consequently they sometimes do not hesitate to have sex with their sisters. In this Age of Kali there are many instances of such incest. Although Yavana-rāja accepted the request of Nārada Muni to show respect to him, he was nonetheless thinking of illicit sex. This was due to his being the King of the <i>yavanas - <span style="color:#990012">ยวนสฺ</span></i> and <i>mlecchas. - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ.</span></i></p></div>

Thus the King of the <i>mlecchas - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ</span></i> and <i>yavanas - <span style="color:#990012">ยวนสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ยวนสฺ</span></i> requested the daughter of Time, Kālakanyā, to become his sister. There was no need to ask her to become his wife, for the <i>yavanas</i> and <i>mlecchas</i> do not make distinctions as far as sex life is concerned. Thus one may outwardly be a sister, mother or daughter and still have sex. Yavana-rāja’s brother was Prajvāra, and Kālakanyā was invalidity itself. Combined and strengthened by the soldiers of Yavana-rāja — namely nonhygienic conditions, illicit sex and ultimately a high degree of temperature to bring on death — they would be able to smash the materialistic way of life. In this connection it is significant that Nārada was immune to the attack of <i>jarā, - <span style="color:#990012">ชรา,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชรา,</span></i> or invalidity. Similarly <i>jarā,</i> or the destructive force, cannot attack any follower of Nārada Muni or another pure Vaiṣṇava.</p></div>
