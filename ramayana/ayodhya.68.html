<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">With the concurrence of Markandeya and other sages, Vasistha instructs messengers to call back Bharata and Satrughna from their
maternal uncle's house. The messengers leave immediately for the capital of Kekaya, riding their fast horses. They cross Ganga River at Hastinapura,
then Saranda River and reach Abhikala village. Then, they cross the holy river of Ikshumati and proceed through Bahlika kingdom in Sudama mountain
range to Vishnupada and finally reach the city of Girivraja.</p>
