<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama notices anxiety and perturbation among the sages who live in the vicinity. When an elderly sage among them is asked by Rama about
the reason for their anguish, the said sage informs that some demons under the leadership of Khara are molesting the sages and hence the sages wished
to leave the place. Rama gives his consent for their leaving. Bidding farewell to them with great respect, Rama retires to his own hermitage.</p>
