<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata and his minister approach the foot of Angudi tree, where Rama has slept on a grass-bed on the ground. Bharata feels bad that
on his account, Rama and Seetha were to sleep on such a grass-bed. He thinks that the city of Ayodhya is plunged in desolation, because of the death
of Dasaratha and the exile of Rama to the forest. Bharata further takes an owe that like Rama, he will also henceforth sleep on grass with his locks
matted, wearing robes of bark and living only on roots and fruits. He says that if Rama refuses his appeal to occupy the throne of Ayodhya, he also
will stay back in the forest along with Rama.</p>
