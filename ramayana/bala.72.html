There is a lot of commentary from the viewpoint of astrology regarding these stars and days of this marriage. Some have 
said that <em>uttare divase</em> &#39;on best day...&#39; <em>phalguni= pūrva phalguni</em> &#39;pre-Phalguni... on the best day under 
pre-Phalguni star...&#39; which usually does not happen, but it is also said to be correct by ṃaheshvara Tīrtha, as the ṃoon 
will be in the 12th house at that time, so the marriage is agreeable...&#39; However the stars for best results of marriages
