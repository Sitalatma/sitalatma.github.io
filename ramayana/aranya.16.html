of turmeric and limejuice and other ingredients and called as <em>kunkuma</em> . This is sacred and 
used in daily worships and applied as a mark on forehead at a place where the Third Eye, <em>jñāna 
netra</em> is said to exist. For the women this mark is for their glorification of womanhood by virtue 
of the existence of her husband. Should she become a widow this mark is made no more and her face will 
become dullish for she is without a husband. So also the sun is such a mark on the forehead of the woman 
called horizon. Without him no quarters glitter.</p>

<div id="btn2" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
The three <em>yāmā</em>-s or <em>praharaḥ</em>-s, are three hours or three watches, where each <em>
yāma</em>, is three hours. The commentators said that <em>nivṛitta ākāsha shayanā</em> : precluded 
are troubles to those that are reclining in heavens i.e., divine beings; <em>vṛiddha tara tri yāmā</em> 
: prolonged are the nightly activities of demons. <em>puṣya ānītā</em> , where <em>puṣya</em> also 
means Kali, the doom, and the demons are brining it up. Thus Lakshmana is said to have reminded Rama 
about the purpose of his incarnation, where the gods are precluded from a restful reclining, the nightly 
activities of demons are on the increase, and the demons are bringing doom time, so Rama has to quicken 
their eradication.</p>

The vernal breeze will be cool by its nature and so is the Omnipotent. Now the snowy dew enriches the

The sun now risen is Rama. The word <em>bāṣpa</em> also means tears. The fertile lands are shedding 
tears in fear of Ravana. Again <em>bāṣpaḥ</em> is vapour that spreads. Rama&#39;s benevolence is spreading 
like vapour. The forests are with full crops. The lands are full with asceticism and Vedic practices 
to receive the mercy of Rama. The birds&#39; callings are the echoing of Vedic sonority. Govindaraja. The
<em>yava</em> grains are not exactly western barley grains as usually shown in lexicons. It is called 
locally as <em>jov dhān</em> and is used in fire oblations, . It is a dietary prescription to diabetics

Extolling seasons in epics</p>

<p class="Itrṣloka">
&nbsp;</p>

<p class="tat">The portrayal of seasons in epics with all their delicacies is 
a disputed topic. Ramayana also deals much on these descriptions of seasons. Whether an epic avowed 
to reflect the Vedic import, as said at 1-4-6, <em>vedopabṛihmaṇārthāya</em> , and that which is 
pious and merited <em>puṇyam vedaischa samamatam</em> at 1-1-98, should have accounts on seasons   is 
the question. For this is said that relating niceties of season time and again, is in perfect accord 
with Veda, for the season and time are subservient to all Veda-s as per the ancillary of Veda, the Astrology,
<em>veda-anga : jyotiṣhya</em> . Veda-s themselves say that the year is the soul of the horse of Ashvameda.
<em>uṣhā 
vā ashvasya medhasya shiraḥ | sa~Nvatsara ātmāshvasya medhasya | -- yajurveda bṛihadāraṇyaka</em> 
Hence time and season are the mind and soul of all Veda-s.</p>

<p class="tat">Like this we find beautification of four seasons at four places, 
for e.g., <em>hemanta</em> spring is narrated in starting of Kishkindha. And <em>vasanta</em> post autumnal 
season is described in Kishkindha 43rd chapter, when Hanuma and others are in search for Seetha, and 
after their exit from the cave of Swayamprabha. <em>varṣa</em> rainy season is portrayed in 28th chapter 
of Kishkindha. At every possible occasion, all the rituals, daily routines that are time oriented, do 
explain the importance of time than the importance of ritual or daily routine. It is said:
<em>vedopabṛihmaṇārtham 
pravṛitte asmin granthe veda vihita karma apekṣhita kāla visheṣha nirṇāyakatvāt kāla sādhāraṇa 
lakṣhaṇa pratipādanam eva tat tat ṛitu varṇana vyājena kṛitam iti dharmopayoga sambhavāt | -- sāyam 
kālādi cihna pratipādanam iti etat sarvam karma anuṣhṭāna upayukta kāla jñāpanārtham eva kṛitam 
iti dharma paryavasānam sambhavati eva -- dharmākūtam</em></p>

<p class="tat">Thus dharma is upheld in 
all these narratives about the season and time, which aspect is upheld by the commentators and they 
too comment lengthily whenever a season or time factor occurs.</p>

Thus, this is the 16th chapter in Aranya Kanmda of Valmiki Ramayana,the 
First Epic poem of India.</p>
