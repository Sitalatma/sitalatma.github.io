<h3><em>Worshiping <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> Devotees Is a Tradition</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp42" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
All service is based on the same point: In the heart you have to be attached to <em>Kṛṣṇa</em>. With some service you can fake it to a certain degree. You can go on for some time gardening, sweeping the floor, or typing correspondence without love of Godhead, but you cannot fake it when you are preaching. You must have some genuine attachment to <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> within your heart, because every day you are exposed to <em>māyā</em>. You may consider yourself glorious at doing a particular preaching service, but as soon as somebody criticizes you or a demon gives you trouble on the street, the glorious illusion is shattered and you reconsider, thinking, “Maybe I should become a cook.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp43" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The fact that one continues <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> proves that one has attained love of Godhead. Therefore we worship the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees. Sometimes a foolish polemic arises if someone dares to say that the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are the greatest, because others think, “What's the matter with you? Don't you understand that everything else is just as important?" Yes, it is true—the point is love of God—but a preacher must have love of God; otherwise, he sinks back into just taking care of himself. Therefore we worship the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp44" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In Bengal, if you do a <em>harināma</em> on the street, all the people come out with <em>lotās</em> of water and try to throw it at your feet. They know you will probably jump away, so they are satisfied if it just lands on the ground in front of you. Then they bring out a plate of colored rice and cracked coconut, and they start offering you <em>ārati</em>. Everybody—every householder, every villager—comes out to worship the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees. This is tradition.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp45" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
It is a tradition in Lord Caitanya's movement to worship saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na devotees. It is not a concoction of fanatics. It is a <em>sampradāya</em> tradition coming to us through the <em>paramparā</em>, and it cannot be whimsically given up. It must be continued, because love of God comes in this age through <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>—glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp46" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> we do nowadays is absolutely <em>paramparā</em>. Although book distribution is criticized by some persons of little knowledge, it is Lord Caitanya's mission without even the slightest deviation. It is the authorized means of attaining love of God. <em>Yajñaiḥ saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-prāyair/yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</em>—if you have brains, you will join in the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em> and become a lover of God. You will understand and appreciate the association of anyone fully absorbed in this <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement.

<h3><em>The Birth of the <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> Movement</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp48" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement appeared when Lord Caitanya began to preach in Navadvīpa. At that time, there was only the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Book distribution developed later on, when Lord Caitanya encouraged the six Gosvāmīs of Vịndāvana to write books. Some people ask, "Why didn't Lord Caitanya Himself start the book distribution?” The answer is simple: There were no books. First He had to make the devotees who would write the books. Then He could inspire others to produce and distribute them.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp49" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's foremost representatives, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, received direct instruction from Lord Caitanya to reveal the principles of devotional service in written form for the benefit of all Vaiṣṇavas. When the Gosvāmīs first went to Vịndāvana, it was a jungle. The many places of pilgrimage we can visit nowadays had not yet been excavated and restored. Lord Caitanya instructed Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmīs to rediscover these places, but their main business was to write books. Sitting under the trees, they would dip a quill pen into some ink made from pressed flowers and write on special leaves (there was no paper at that time). On one leaf after another they wrote the wonderful books that form the foundation of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement-books such as the <em>Haribhakti-vilāsa</em> and <em>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</em>, which give all the necessary instructions for devotional service.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp50" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The intention of the Gosvāmīs was never sectarian. They wanted all the people of the world, regardless of their languages, to get the essence of Vedic knowledge. Prior to this, Vaiṣṇava philosophy—so perfectly extracted from the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Purāņas</em>—had not been systematically written down. But for the benefit of the followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, book production was begun by Śrīla Sanātana and Rūpa Gosvāmīs and later continued by Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī, who was the most prolific author among the Gosvāmīs. The writings of the Gosvāmīs turned out to be the most important form of saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na, because they were writing books that were soon to be distributed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp51" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
After the disappearance of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī became the Vaiṣṇava <em>ācārya</em> in Vrndāvana. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī was convinced by Śrīmati Jāhnavā-devī, the wife of Lord Nityānanda and head of the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement, of the need to send bhakti literature from Vrndāvana to Bengal. Some years earlier, she had visited Rūpa and Sanātana in Vrndāvana and was well aware of the abundant spiritual literature the Gosvāmīs were producing. To comply with her wishes, Śrīla Jiva Gosvāmī sent Srīnivāsa Ācārya and Narottama dāsa Thākura to distribute the books that had been written to the intellectuals of Bengal. From the precedent set by the Gosvāmīs, book production has been the basis of spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement right up to the present time.

<h3><em><em>Bolo Kṛṣṇa Bhaja Kṛṣṇa<br />Koro Kṛṣṇa-śikṣā</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp53" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda began preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West, he used the example of Jagāi and Mādhāi to demonstrate the incredible mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, because wherever he looked he saw Jagāis and Mādhāis. By using this example, he clearly implied, “Don't worry, by Lord Caitanya's mercy even you can be saved.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp54" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Jagāi and Mādhāi were members of a wealthy and learned aristocratic family that had been respected in Navadvīpa for many generations, but these two men were extraordinary, for they were the greatest debauchees, murderers, drunkards, and thieves. After stealing someone's belongings, they would burn down his house. They would rape women and even kill people. They were very big, very crazy, and could not be stopped. Even the law was afraid of them. They were total outcasts—black sheep in society—and their family had rejected them long ago. They constantly wandered the streets of Navadvīpa in a drunken state, making big scenes. Whenever one of them was not paying attention, the other one would beat him with his fists. One moment they would embrace each other in brotherly love, and the next moment they would pull each other by the hair and fall to the ground, fighting. They were completely mad—more or less the way we were before joining Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's movement.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp55" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
One day Lord Caitanya told Nityānanda Prabhu and Haridāsa Thākura, “I have a new program for you. I want you to go out and preach. Just tell everybody, '<em>Bolo kṛṣņa, bhaja kṛṣņa, koro kṛṣṇa-śikṣā</em>—chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, worship Lord Kṛṣṇa, and live according to His transcendental instructions.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp56" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Thākura would go out every day, knock on every door, and say, “Chant Kṛṣṇa's name, worship Him, and accept His instructions into your life.” Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda often cited Locana dāsa Thākura, who described how Lord Nityānanda cut a canal from the ocean of mercy, which was blocked on all four sides. Taking that canal to the door of every house, He would flood everybody in the house with love of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp57" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Seeing the effulgence coming from the bodies of these two wonderful personalities, the pious people would say, "Yes, I will do it from today on. Welcome, please come in and take something to eat.” But Nityānanda and Haridāsa would reply, "No, we have no time. We are busy preaching, and we have to go to the next door.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp58" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
At some houses, however, the impious people would shout at them, saying, "What are you doing here? You are simply frauds and imposters. If you come back again, I'm going to call the law!" Other rascals would say, “You only come here to get something to fill your bellies.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp59" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
"This Nimāi Paṇḍita has ruined many good persons, and now He is ruining you as well.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp60" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
"Can't you understand that you should only chant 'Kṛṣṇa' softly? Don't you think your God is going to be disturbed by all your screaming and howling?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp61" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Thākura came back every night and told Lord Caitanya about the rascals they had met, Lord Caitanya would say, “Do not fear, I will cut off their heads with My <em>cakra</em>. Anybody who does not accept what you say, I will cut to pieces."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp62" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
But Nityānanda Prabhu would pacify Him, saying, “Please wait. We want to continue, and we haven't met everybody yet.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp63" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Once Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Thākura were out preaching, and they saw a big crowd of people. Lord Nityānanda asked what was going on, and some of the bystanders replied, “Oh, it is those hooligans Jagāi and Mādhāi.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp64" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
“Who are they?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp65" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
"They are terrible persons, Gosāin. This is no place for You. For Your own safety, You should leave this place immediately.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp66" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
But Lord Nityānanda's interest was aroused. “Tell Me more,” He said. "Who are these two, Jagāi and Mādhāi?” After the people explained the whole story, Lord Nityānanda continued, “Oh, I want to go and save them. If these persons are saved, then everybody will worship My Lord, Gaurānga. Everybody will understand that His mercy is supreme in this world, and they will all sing His praises. What a wonderful opportunity!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp67" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In response, the well-meaning people cried out a warning: "Don't go near these fellows! They will harm You or even kill You! They are crazy, don't You understand? Take our words seriously!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp68" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Thākura ignored them and went near the two brothers. Approaching from the side, out of the brothers' vision, Lord Nityānanda called out, “Listen, dear brothers! Chant Kṛṣṇa's name, worship Him, and take His instructions into your life. If you just chant His holy name, you will be happy.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp69" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In one respect the sinful brothers were all right. They were not <em>aparādhīs</em>. They didn't understand how to offend Vaiṣṇavas, because they were always too drunk. But now two Vaiṣṇavas were standing in front of them. When the brothers heard the request that they surrender to Kṛṣṇa and chant His name, their eyes turned blood-red with rage, and they started chasing Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Thākura, who went racing off in full flight. The two monstrous brothers drunkenly stumbled along after them, screaming, “Wait! We'll show you what we think of your chanting! Why don't you stay here and get to know us better?”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp70" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Then Haridāsa Thākura said to Lord Nityānanda, “Another fine mess You've gotten us into. We came here to preach, and look what's happened now! It's all because of Your magnanimous nature.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp71" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Lord Nityānanda replied, “It's not My fault! It's your Lord Caitanya's fault. He's the one who sent us here."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp72" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Arguing as they were running, Haridāsa Thākura complained, “I don't know why I keep coming out with You! You're always getting us into trouble. You jump into the Ganges and start wrestling with the crocodiles. You chase after children playing on the riverbank, screaming frighteningly, and I have to console the angry parents who want to beat You, trying to explain to them that You're an <em>avadhūta</em> and You think You're a cowherd boy. You ask girls to marry You. You milk cows and drink all the milk. You steal buckets of butter and cream, and when the bewildered cowherd men come to beat You, You run away, leaving me alone to ward them off. I don't know why I come with You all the time. This preaching gets us into so much difficulty!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp73" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In this way they ran down the road toward Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita's house enjoying a mock argument. Finally, Jagāi and Mādhāi became so confused that they just fell down on the street, and Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Thākura slipped out of sight to recover. Breathing heavily and looking back in the direction of their fallen pursuers, Nityānanda and Haridāsa began to laugh, joking about the two drunkards and embracing each other in ecstasy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp74" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Upon hearing about everything that had happened, Lord Caitanya angrily exclaimed, “I will chop them to pieces immediately!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp75" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
But Nityānanda Prabhu implored, “No, give us a chance to save them. If You will kindly offer Your mercy to them, they will surely be saved.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp76" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
At this Lord Caitanya said, “If You want them to be saved, then they are immediately saved. It has already happened by Your desire. Soon we shall see them in our company as Vaiṣṇavas.” When the associates of the Lord heard this decree, they all started to jubilantly chant “Hari bol!"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp77" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Soon, by divine arrangement (Lord Caitanya's desire), Jagāi and Mādhāi set up their den on the Ganges where Lord Caitanya took His bath. The rogues were so nasty—rolling around drunkenly and doing all kinds of horrible things—that nobody wanted to bathe in the Ganges anymore. Lord Caitanya would keep His distance, but when Jagāi and Mādhāi saw Him, they would mockingly request Him to conduct a Durgā-ārati, because they liked to dance drunkenly to the sound of the sweet <em>kīrtana</em> coming every night from the Lord's house.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp78" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Shortly thereafter, Lord Nityānanda thought, "Now is My chance.” He stood before Jagāi and Mādhāi peacefully and said, “My Lord Caitanya wishes that you be blessed with love of Godhead. Please kindly accept the lotus feet of the Lord and render devotional service unto Him.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp79" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
"Who is this?” Mādhāi asked, “What does this guy want?” In reply Jagāi sneeringly drawled, “He's an <em>avadhūta</em>.” When Mādhāi heard this, he picked up a piece of a broken earthen wine pot and threw it at Nityānanda Prabhu. It hit Him in the forehead and blood came pouring down all over His body. Mādhāi raised his arms and moved forward, wanting to attack again, but Jagāi grabbed him and protested, “What are you doing? Are you mad? He's innocent! He didn't do anything wrong. Why are you threatening Him like this? You should protect Him.” The townspeople witnessing the incident quickly ran to Lord Caitanya and told Him what had happened. When Lord Caitanya came and saw blood all over Nityānanda Prabhu, He raised His index finger in the air and cried out threateningly, “<em>Cakra!</em>" Summoned thus, the Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> immediately appeared, spinning on His finger. The brothers were struck with amazement and fear, for they knew that this <em>cakra</em> was ready to chop them in half.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp80" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Nityānanda Prabhu appealed to the Lord. “Stop!” He cried, “You have appeared in this incarnation to save them, not to kill them! Your mission is not to kill the demons but to flood them with love of Godhead. Jagāi was trying to protect Me. It's all over now; it was just an accident, and I don't feel any pain. There is nothing to worry about and I am not disturbed."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp81" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When Lord Caitanya heard this He immediately embraced Jagāi, saying, "Oh, My dear Jagāi, you are so wonderful for protecting My Lord Nityānanda.” Jagāi immediately fell over unconscious in love of Godhead, shaking and rolling on the ground. Since Jagāi and Mādhāi were practically like one soul, Mādhāi also became purified. Realizing what a fool he was, he threw himself at the feet of Lord Caitanya, saying, “Please purify me too! Why only him?”.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp82" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Lord Caitanya replied, “I cannot deliver you. You were responsible for shedding Nityananda's blood.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp83" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
But Mādhāi begged, “You cannot say this, my Lord. How can You act against Your own religion? In Your previous incarnation You even gave liberation to demons who pierced Your body with arrows. And they were big demons, whereas I'm only a little demon! Why shouldn't You accept me?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp84" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Lord Caitanya was firm. “That may be good logic,” He said, "but you have offended Nityānanda Prabhu. Go and surrender to Him!” Mādhāi immediately clasped the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, and then he too became mad in love of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp85" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Afterward they all went back to Lord Caitanya's house. When the other devotees saw how Jagāi and Mādhāi had become the personal associates of the Lord and were rolling on the ground in love of Godhead, they could not believe it. They asked, “How did these drunks become devotees?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp86" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Lord Caitanya answered, “Don't call them drunks! They are Vaiaṣṇavas! Accept them as your brothers.” Everybody was amazed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp87" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
In an equally amazing way, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda transformed sinful wretches like us into blissful devotees of Lord Caitanya and engaged us in the Lord's eternal <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na-lilā</em>.

<h3><em><em>Bṛhad-mṛdanga</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp89" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement took birth with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but its rebirth took place when books became an important and powerful means to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness to everyone. After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left this world, Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism diminished. The Vaiṣņavas either went back to Godhead or went on different preaching engagements throughout the universe. Only a few were left. The world filled up with dull souls engaging in fruitive activities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp90" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Over a century ago, Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, the leader of the Vaiṣṇavas in Mayapur, declared to Śrīla Bha&shy;kti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Thākura that he should spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in an organized fashion. On that order, Śrīla Bha&shy;kti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Thākura personally reconstructed the basis of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism. He reestablished the places of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's appearance and pastimes in Mayapur and wrote hundreds of books and articles. But this reconstruction was a hard task, so he begged the Lord to send “a ray of Viṣṇu” to help him. Kṛṣṇa was merciful and sent an assistant, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, whose preaching was so powerful that all over India, Māyāvādi philosophy and caste gosvāmism were smashed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp91" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī started a society of Vaiṣṇavas known as the Gauḍīya Matha. He had thousands of disciples, and some of his representatives went as far as England and Germany. His mission was a great one. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta established the method needed to cut the hard knot of material attachment in the heart, <em>hṛdaya-granthi</em>. The way to cut this <em>hrdaya-granthi</em> is with <em>grantha</em>—the books of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or <em>śāstra</em>. <em>Sāstra</em> means not only "book” but also "weapon.” This relationship is significant, because the books are our weapons.

</div>
<div id="pp92" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Prior to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta's time, books were distributed to scholars, but not in a systematic way to people in general. Lord Caitanya recommended chanting and <em>prasādam</em> for the masses and philosophy for the scholars. But as Kali-yuga progressed, people became so fallen that they were unable to accept the chanting and <em>prasādam</em>, and they required understanding to go forward.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp93" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Therefore Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta put so much emphasis on publishing books. He called book publication the <em>bṛhad</em>, or big, <em>mṛdanga</em>. The little <em>mṛdanga</em> may be heard for one block, but the big <em>mṛdanga</em> can be heard around the world. In the marble temple Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta had built in Bagh Bazaar, Calcutta, he installed the Deity on one side and the printing press directly opposite, across the courtyard. To him the printing of books was so important that he considered the beat of the press to be <em>kīrtana</em> and wanted it to sound in the temple all day. Listening to that <em>kīrtana</em> and having <em>darśana</em> of the printing press, the Deities were very happy.

<h3><em><em>Lava-mātra</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp95" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The <em>śāstra</em> declares that one should associate with a saintly personality, even if just for a moment, a <em>lava-mātra</em>. (A <em>lava</em> is one eleventh of a second.) This association can change one's entire life. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda used his own life as evidence of this statement. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was not interested in hearing from some ordinary <em>sādhu</em> when he first went to see Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, because Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda had experienced the different <em>sādhus</em> who came to his father's house. They were engaged in illicit activities like smoking <em>gañjā</em> or eating meat, and he was not enthusiastic to meet another one. But his friend practically brought him by force.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp96" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
At first Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda started to argue with Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta a little, saying, “How can India take interest in spiritual practices if it is a nation subordinate to the British? First we must gain our freedom, and then we can have Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” But Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta did not accept this argument. He said that winning independence from the British was a material affair; it had nothing to do with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Rather, one should depend on Kṛṣṇa and serve Kṛṣṇa, and then all material problems of life will cease, including the problem of dependency on a foreign power.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp97" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda realized that this <em>sādhu</em> was right and that Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission was safely in the hands of an expert. Although it was not a long meeting, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was completely convinced and took the mission to heart.

<h3><em>If You Ever Get Money</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp99" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Thākura organized a large <em>parikrama</em> of the Vrndāvana area, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda met him at Rādhā-kunda. While they were walking and talking together, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta stated to Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda confidentially, “I regret that I have built this temple in Bagh Bazaar, because there will be fire within these walls. Already in my presence they are fighting over who will get which room in the temple, and after my departure everything will be ruined. I would rather take down the marble from the walls and floors, sell it, and print books. If you ever get any money, print books."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp100" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Distributing books in India at that time was difficult. If a disciple went over to Navadvīpa and distributed even one magazine, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta would heap praise upon him. It became obvious to Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda that books were more important to his spiritual master than temples, and he became fixed on what was important, although he was living outside the Gauḍīya Matha. From the outside he could observe what his spiritual master was constantly stressing. The others living inside were thinking about the politics and sense gratification concerning their residence and surroundings. There were many problems. That is why Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta called it “fire within the walls.” But Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, watching his spiritual master act, could see that printing books was the real point. Later, when Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was expanding his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, again and again he always repeated, “Print books! Print books! Print books!” because that is what he had learned from his spiritual master. That is called <em>paramparā</em>—learn the most important activity from your spiritual master and make it your life's mission.

<h3><em>Taking Up the Mission</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp102" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī made the mission of his father, Śrīla Bha&shy;kti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Thākura, his mission and spread that mission throughout India. Then Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda took up that mission and spread it all over the world. The mission was tenderly passed down from one <em>ācārya</em> to the next. Others may claim that they too were responsible for wonderful things in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but we don't see it. We see how one pure devotee can create another, how one <em>nitya-siddha</em> awakens another, and how the mission is given from guru to disciple.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp103" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta told Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda on their first meeting, “You are intelligent. Preach this mission in the English language for the benefit of the world.” Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda had not even been to the temple yet, but the instruction that eventually led to Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's coming to the Western world was already given. He just walked in, bowed down, listened a little while, made some argument, and got the mission of his life. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta cut out the formalities and got to the point, because he knew he was talking to a <em>nitya-siddha</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp104" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta was pleased with Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda. When Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda did the preaching that established the Bombay temple in 1935, the devotees said, “He is expert. He should be the temple president.” But Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta replied, “Do not push him for this now. In the future he will do everything." Nobody understood the meaning of this statement. Some thought Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was too attached and could not do it, but they did not know that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta knew Kṛṣṇa's plan. He used the word "everything." What did that mean? It meant exactly that Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda would do everything needed to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls all over the world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp105" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was so powerful that after his disappearance, nobody was there to replace him. So many problems arose, because his disciples were not working together for the preaching mission. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda once wrote in one of his Vyāsa-pūjā offerings, “The world looks empty in the absence of you.” The world looked vacant, for his spiritual master was the only one who could tie together the disjointed forces.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp106" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda tried to bring these forces together, but he could not, so in due course of time he took up that mission by writing and publishing books. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was producing books twenty years before he came to America. In the 1940's he started “Back to Godhead," an English magazine that presented the philosophy in an understandable way. He started to translate the Caitanya-caritāmta</em>, which he printed serially in his magazine. He wrote more than one thousand pages of commentary on the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, which were unfortunately lost somehow. His grand opus was <em>Srīmad Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>. When he finished the first three volumes of the First Canto, in which he included everything necessary to make one Kṛṣṇa conscious, the time was ripe to fulfill the mission of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and go to the Western countries.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp107" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was having dreams in which his spiritual master would come to him and say, “Come with me! Take <em>sannyāsa</em>!” Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda would wake up from the dream and think, “Take <em>sannyāsa</em>! Oh, how terrible!” But after a while he realized that this might be the only means to preach. One of his Godbrothers, Śrīla Keśava Mahārāja, told Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda that unless one becomes a <em>sannyāsī</em>, it is not possible to preach everywhere. Therefore Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda entered the renounced order of life, started producing the <em>Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>, and prepared to go West.

<h3><em>Law Books For the Next<br />Ten Thousand Years</em></h3>

<div id="pp109" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Regardless of where you are in the line of followers of Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, it is your responsibility to print and distribute his books in mass quantities throughout the world. This was his desire, the desire of his spiritual master, and the desire of all the <em>ācāryas</em>, and therefore it is also our desire. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books are not just for one generation. He said that he was writing these books as the law books for the next ten thousand years. That doesn't mean you put them on the shelf in some lawyer's office; it means you give them to everybody.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp110" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda wrote these books to be read by all people, in all places, and at all times. They are eternally relevant because they contain all the instructions necessary for spiritual life from the <em>mahātmās</em>, and thus they will be the basis of the future Kṛṣṇa conscious civilization. <em>Mahat-sevām dvāram āhur vimukteņ</em>—if you associate with a <em>mahātmā</em> and read these books, the door to liberation is thrown open to you.

<h3><em>Symptoms of a <em>Sādhu</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp112" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
During the Kārttika festival of 1972, Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda lectured daily at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple from <em class="em">The Nectar of Devotion</em>. He sat under the same tree the Gosvāmīs used to sit under and discuss topics about Kṛṣṇa and how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda said that once he was sitting in front of Rūpa Gosvāmī's <em>samādhi</em> and Rūpa Gosvāmī personally told him to go and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp113" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
At that time, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was already into the retirement years. Nowadays, they retire people at the age of sixty or sixty-five and give them retirement benefits, because they can no longer work efficiently and earn their pay. But Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was writing <em>Srīmad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> and performing <em>bhajana</em>-hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord under the direct inspiration and instruction of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. And now in his old age, he was going to America.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp114" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
By going West, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda displayed the symptoms of a saintly personality, a <em>sādhu</em>. A real <em>sādhu</em> is <em>titikșavaḥ kāruņikāḥ suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>. <em>Titikṣavaḥ</em>—tolerant; <em>kāruņikāḥ</em>—merciful; <em>suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>—the best wellwishing friend of all living entities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp115" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was so tolerant. While following the order of his spiritual master and going to America, he tolerated much suffering and difficulty. First, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean by boat. I know what it means to be on a boat. Once I took a ferry from Sweden to Poland. It took twenty-seven hours. I spent the ferry ride as sick as ten dogs. After that, I swore that I would never take a boat again as long as I live, and I haven't. If you just mention a boat, I get seasick. Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, on the other hand, was on a cargo carrier for thirty-eight days. While at sea, he tolerated severe seasickness and several heart attacks. But he was assured of Kṛṣṇa's protection. Kṛṣṇa and all of His incarnations appeared to him in a dream. They were in another boat, pulling him through the water and encouraging him onward with the words, “Yes, you must go to America.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp116" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
After arriving in America, he first stayed with a family who didn't know anything about Kṛṣņa consciousness and then at a YMCA. Then, without friends, money, or facilities, he went to the most degraded place in New York City—the Bowery. In this hellish place, as well as in the equally hellish Lower East Side, there were many obstacles, but he went on with his preaching. He worked hard, even cooking for the devotees and distributing <em>prasādam</em> to them, because he was <em>kāruņikaḥ</em>—merciful.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp117" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
We are all made of Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's mercy. Without his great tolerance and mercy, we would never have received this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Who in the history of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism or before that ever even thought of going to the Western world and preaching Kṛṣņa consciousness? Śrīla Bha&shy;kti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Thākura had introduced Kṛṣṇa consciousness by sending books to the West, but nobody had ever gone there to preach to the <em>mlecchas</em> and <em>yavanas</em>, live among them, and make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. We can never glorify Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda enough, because if he had not come, none of us would be here today. We would still be rotting in the material world, performing obnoxious activities. We all know perfectly well what we would be doing if it had not been for Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda. We owe our lives to him. Therefore we should completely surrender our entire lives at the lotus feet of the Founder-Acārya of this society, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda. This will make us qualified to satisfy the previous <em>ācāryas</em> and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing more is to be gained in the world than this.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp118" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's mood was simple to understand. He was in the mood of Prahlāda Mahārāja. Once in South Africa, while Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was writing the section of <em>Srīmad Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> that tells of Prahlāda Mahārāja, I happened to mention, "Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda, you are always absorbed in the mood of Prahlāda Mahārāja,” and he said, “Yes, I am always thinking of how to save these fools and rascals.” We can read about Prahlāda Mahārāja and try to enter into his mood. Then we will understand the mood of the preacher, whose only concern is to give Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the people of this world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp119" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The disciple should want to share the mood of his spiritual master to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world. That is why we travel from town to town and village to village with Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's books, expanding Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's preaching mission and bringing new people to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. By doing this the disciple can become perfect. This is the real meaning of mercy—to only think of the best thing for people's Kṛṣṇa consciousness and to try to help them advance in spiritual life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp120" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
To spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda continually traveled worldwide, writing and preaching wherever he went. It was a great austerity, but because he felt love and compassion for all living entities, <em>suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>, preaching was his life. He was preaching early every morning by writing his transcendental purports, he was preaching during the morning walk, and he continued preaching by giving morning class. All day and night, in every activity and at every opportunity, Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was preaching. He was always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's philosophy, Kṛṣṇa's words, and preaching Kṛṣṇa's glories. Everything he saw would remind him of a philosophical point, with which he would expand our consciousness and understanding of Kṛṣṇa. It was wonderful to have his association and hear his explanations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp121" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was not only learned, but he also gave us everything in his books. He translated the texts from the original Sanskrit and manifested his emotional ecstasies in incomparable purports. When people open their minds and begin to read Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda's words, his great love and mercy enter and gradually change their hearts.

</div>
<div id="pp122" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">

Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda is so pleased that we are printing his books in all different languages. We just print books and fill up the warehouses, never worrying about printing too many books. We often have a competition between the BBT devotees and the distributors: the BBT devotees are only happy when the warehouse is full of books, and the distributors are only happy when the warehouse is completely empty. We have so much work ahead of us. We have so many books to be distributed
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp123" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was the first book distributor. He went to America with almost nothing except two wooden cases of his transcendental books. By selling them, he managed to survive. Later, when the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books were printed, he was the first one to distribute them. During the 1970 Ratha-yātrā in San Francisco, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda was on the stage, and someone brought the first ten copies up to him. Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda announced: “Now an important moment in history has come. For the first time these beautifully bound <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books are available in the English language. Who will come up and take these books? Ten dollars each. And I will sign them!” Hundreds of people ran up to the stage with ten dollar bills in their hands. The books were sold in an instant, and he didn't even keep a copy for himself. This is <em>suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp124" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Nowadays, when we want to start a new project, we need a pile of money in the bank and so much paraphernalia before we can do anything. What now takes many of us to do, Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda did by himself. He is the personification of Kṛṣṇa's mercy, and he descended into this world just to perform this most ecstatic mission. Therefore we want to develop attachment to his lotus feet and go on with his mission.

<h3><em>The Tradition Continues</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp126" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
The mission that Śrila Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda has given us originally came from Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya says in the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, <em>Adi-lilā</em>, Chapter Nine, “I order every person within this universe to take up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and spread it everywhere.” If you do that - and it is not difficult to do—then Lord Caitanya is ready to throw mercy all over you.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp127" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
I can remember a graphic illustration of this mercy, as it descends through Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda. We were smuggling books into the former East Germany, an activity for which one could go to jail for at least fifteen years. We went through the border in two vans. I went through with entry status and the other van went through with transit status. We both had the same model of van, old Hanumag Henschels, which we used at Schloss Rettershof for book distribution. The transit van was filled with boxes of books, and I was alone in the completely empty entry van. The border guard got suspicious when he looked into my van because there wasn't a single thing in it except the car papers. I didn't even have a suitcase, because there would not be enough room for anything else in the van when we filled it with books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp128" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
According to our plan, we would meet at the first rest area that was open. The other van arrived before me because going through transit was quicker than going through entry. We met and parked the two vans right next to each other. We were just going to take the books out when a police car came into the rest area. Trying to look calm and innocent, we took some apples and sat under a tree. The police were looking at us and the vans again and again. They could plainly see that one van was empty and the other piled up with boxes, but they must have thought that it looked innocent, because they went on their way.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp129" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
When they left, we immediately piled all the books into my van, and I drove off. After about five kilometers, I saw the police car by the side of the road and one of the policemen, standing by the car with a walkie-talkie. When he saw me, he started waving his hands for me to stop. I thought, “Now I am finished. I have entry status and not transit, and the van is filled with illegal books. This means the end." I figured that it would be better to outrace these people than it would be to go to jail for fifteen years. After all, it looked as though I would go to jail anyway. Pretending not to see the policeman, I looked straight ahead and just kept on driving. As soon as I went over the first hill, I pushed the gas pedal to the floor and went full speed ahead, 130 kilometers per hour, down the East German autobahn, waiting for the flashing light of the police car to appear in my rear-view mirror.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp130" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
Then, all of a sudden, Kṛṣṇa, out of His extraordinary mercy, started pouring down a thunderstorm bigger than had ever been seen in the history of mankind, and it had been so hot that day that the rain immediately caused steam to rise from the autobahn. Steam was everywhere, thunder was booming, lightning was flashing, and I was surfing down the road as fast as I could go. I pulled off at the first exit, which was illegal with my entry status (I was supposed to use only the exit designated for my destination), and I screamed down the road toward Leipzig to deliver the books. By Kṛṣṇa's arrangement, the police car must have been caught in the midst of the storm, and no one was following me.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp131" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
I arrived in Leipzig at about nine-thirty at night. It was dark. I ran up to the house of the devotee who was to receive the books. I banged on his window, and he came out all groggy. I said, “I have some books. Are you ready for them?” He said, "OK,” and I ran back to unload the van. Although the books were so heavy that two men had had to load each box into the van, I was so full of adrenaline that I picked up a box all by myself, ran up to the house, and threw it through the window. It hit this devotee in the chest, and he fell, moaning, to the floor. I kept running back and forth as fast as I could with boxes of books from the van, which was under a street light because there was nowhere else to park. I kept throwing the boxes through the window, and he kept falling to the floor. Finally his little room was so full of books that he had no more place to stay, and I said, “Good-bye. See you tomorrow, if I can.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp132" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
<p>
I ran to the van and drove off, thinking, "I have done it. I'm safe. There is no problem.” Then, after driving around until two in the morning to get to a campground, I went to sleep. I was sleeping dead away, when around five-thirty in the morning, I heard on the window: Knock, knock, knock. “Oh, no," I thought. “It's not happening!” I heard it again: Knock, knock, knock. And someone said my name. I had to get up. “This is it,” I thought. “They have found me out. They took my license plate number, found out at the border who was in the car, and tracked me down to this campground. I'm finished. This is the end." Then I opened the door, and a man said, “You have a telephone call.” I replied, “Oh, really, how nice!" I got up and went to the telephone. It was Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami, who was then Sucandra dāsa. He knew where I was because I had told him where I planned to stay. He informed me that Śrīla Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pāda had called from America and wanted me to meet him in London the very next day to become his secretary. I could understand that just because we tried to do a little service of smuggling books, Kṛṣṇa was directly offering His transcendental mercy.

<h3><em>An Echo Throughout the Universe</em></h3>

<p>
The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to come to the topmost platform of love in separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Srī Caitanya Mahāprabhu brought this understanding along with the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement for the benefit of all living entities. Lord Caitanya Himself was absorbed in this mood; therefore His devotees are following in His footsteps by continuing to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world with love in separation.

Kṛṣṇa enjoys in the spiritual world, but He also has some feeling of suffering. This is a wonderful thing. How can Kṛṣṇa suffer? Kṛṣṇa cannot suffer. Lord Caitanya cannot suffer. But He feels suffering in the sense that He wants to give His mercy to all the fallen souls. He is thinking, "Why are these foolish living entities suffering in the material world? When are they ever coming back to Me?”

Once Lord Caitanya lamented in this way to Haridāsa Thākura, who intelligently replied, "My dear Lord, You already delivered all the living entities when you were in the Jhārikhanda forest.” When Lord Caitanya was walking around in the Jhārikhanda forest, He made all the animals dance. Tigers, lions, elephants, birds, and rabbits were dancing and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa together. Even deadly enemies, like tigers and deer, were hugging and kissing each other. This vibration of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> set in motion by Lord Caitanya echoed throughout the universe. Soon all the living entities, both moving and nonmoving, were vibrating the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em>. In this way, Lord Caitanya delivered living entities all over the universe and sent them back to Godhead. Then immediately those living entities who had not had manifested forms took such forms and filled up the spaces in the universe.

So now, as Lord Caitanya's devotees, our business is to continue that process and again clean the living entities out of the universe and send them all back home, back to Godhead.
