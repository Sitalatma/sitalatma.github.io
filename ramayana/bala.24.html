The epithets in Ramayana
</p>


<p class="comment">The epithets used in epic may be on the increase from now, and 
they may not be construed as redundant foot fillers. All have implicit meanings and they can be 
understood with the help of commentaries. As this work cannot include voluminous commentaries, many 
of the meanings of epithets as said by commentators are not incorporated. This bypassing will not 
effect the ordinary narration. For e.g., the meaning to the words <em>muni pungava, nara shārdūla
</em>will be &#39;saint, the eminent&#39; &#39;tigerly man.&#39; And trying to obtain a squeezed meaning from them 
would be futile, without resorting to some commentary. So also, there are words like <em>indra, 
candra, simha, shārdūla, nāga, vṛiṣabha, pungava </em>which when suffixed to vocatives will mean 
&#39;best, choicest, excellent&#39; etc., as per <em>simha shārdūla nāga ādyāḥ pumsi shreṣṭa artha 
gocarā</em>. But commentators have explained why that character is &#39;best or excellent, or a lion&#39; 
at that juncture. For e.g., <em>dharma ātmā </em>the apparently usual epithet in Ramayana has many 
meanings like – 1] one whose life is dharma; 2] one whose body is dharma incarnate; 3] one whose 
soul is filled with dharma; 4] one whose entity itself is dharma – so on, basing on the thesaurus of
<em>ātma </em>that say as: <em>ātmā yatna dhṛiti svānta svabhāva paramātmāsu jīva buddhi 
sharīreṣu.</em>.</p>


<p class="comment">So also, more than often Seetha will be referred as Vaidehi or 
ṃaithili in Aranya Kanda. Some details about it are incorporated in that book. Wherever possible 
those niceties will be included subject to availability of commentaries, which commentaries have 
already became &#39;the flowers in the sky.&#39;</p>



<p  class="comment">
Hence, without trying to squeeze meaningless meanings, and leaving this aspect to pundits and 
researchers, and as this work cannot be stuffed with those intricacies, henceforth the meanings of 
epithets are said simply, and at times ignored also. This may please be kept in view while reading.</p>
