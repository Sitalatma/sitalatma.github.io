Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Bharata, after hearing the good news from Hanuma about the arrival of Rama, calls Shatrughna and commands him to make appropriate
arrangements for the reception of Rama in the City of Ayodhya. Bharata departs with all others, for Nandigrama to receive Rama. The aerial car lands
at Nandigrama. Bharata welcomes Rama and others, by embracing them and by greeting them joyously. Rama too offers his salutations to all his mothers,
who come to receive him. Then, Bharata brings Rama's wooden sandals and places them below the feet of Rama. Rama commands Pushpaka, the aerial car to
return to Kubera, the lord of riches to whom it originally belonged.</p>
