Being a creation of nescience, the body has two types of activities. In the bodily conception, when we think that sense gratification will help us, we are in illusion. Another kind of illusion is to think that one will become happy by trying to satisfy the desires that arise from the illusory body or by attaining elevation to the higher planetary systems or by performing various types of Vedic rituals. This is all illusion. Similarly, material activities performed for political emancipation and social and humanitarian activities performed with an idea that people of the world will be happy are also illusory because the basic principle is the bodily conception, which is illusory. Whatever we desire or perform under the bodily conception is all illusion. In other words, Lord Viṣṇu informed Pṛthu Mahārāja that although the sacrificial performances set an example for ordinary people, there was no need for such sacrificial performances as far as his personal self was concerned.

According to Śrī Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, in this verse Lord Viṣṇu is describing Himself, or the Paramātmā. The Paramātmā is always distinguished from the embodied soul as well as the material world. Therefore He has been described as <i>para. - <span style="color:#990012">ปร.</span></i> That <i>para, - <span style="color:#990012">ปร,</span></i> or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is <i>eka - <span style="color:#990012">เอก</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">เอก,</span></i> meaning “one.” The Lord is one, whereas the conditioned souls embodied within the material world exist in many varieties of form. There are demigods, human beings, animals, trees, birds, bees and so forth. Thus the living entities are not <i>eka</i> but many. As confirmed in the <i>Vedas: - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ:</span></i> <i>nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām. - <span style="color:#990012">นิโตฺย นิตฺยานาํ เจตนศฺ เจตนานามฺ.</span></i> The living entities, who are many and who are entangled in this material world, are not pure. However, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pure and detached. Due to being covered by the material body, the living entities are not self-effulgent, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Paramātmā, - <span style="color:#990012">อาตฺมา,</span> is self-effulgent. The living entities, being contaminated by the modes of material nature, are called <i>saguṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">สคุณ,</span></i> whereas Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is <i>nirguṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺคุณ,</span></i> not being under the influence of the material modes. The living entities, being encaged in material qualities, are <i>guṇāśrita, - <span style="color:#990012">คุณาศฺริต,</span></i> whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead is <i>guṇāśraya. - <span style="color:#990012">คุณาศฺรย.</span></i> The conditioned soul’s vision is covered by material contamination; therefore he cannot see the cause of his actions, and he cannot see his past lives. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, not being covered by a material body, is the witness of all the activities of the living entity. But both of them, the living entity and the Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are <i>ātmā,</i> or spirit. They are one in quality, yet they are different in so many ways, especially in regard to the six opulences the Supreme Personality of Godhead has in full. Full knowledge means that the <i>jīva-ātmā, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-อาตฺมา,</span></i> the living entity, must know both his position and the Supreme’s position. That is full knowledge.</p></div>

Discharging one’s occupational duty as a means of rendering devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> confirms this as the process of <i>karma-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-โยค.</span></i> In other words, we should act only for the satisfaction and service of the Lord; otherwise we will be entangled by the resultant actions.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31750" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Everyone is situated in his occupational duty, but the purpose of material occupations should not be material gain. Rather, everyone should offer the results of his occupational activities. A <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> especially should execute his occupational duties not for material gain but to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The <i>kṣatriya, vaiśya - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย, ไวศฺย</span></i> and <i>śūdra - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span></i> should work in a similar way. In this material world everyone is engaged in various professional and occupational duties, but the purpose of such activities should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Devotional service is very simple, and anyone can adopt it. Let one remain what he is; he need only install the Deity of the Supreme Lord in his house. The Deity may be Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa (there are many other forms of the Lord). In this way a <i>brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ, กฺษตฺริย, ไวศฺย</span></i> or <i>śūdra</i> can worship the Deity with the results of his honest labor. Regardless of one’s occupational duty, one should adopt the devotional means of hearing, chanting, remembering, worshiping, offering everything to the Lord and engaging in His service. In this way one can very easily engage himself in the service of the Lord. When the Lord is pleased with one’s service, one’s mission in life is fulfilled.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31760" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This verse describes how one can become liberated from material bondage. The first point is that one must know that the soul is different from his body. The soul is called <i>dehī, - <span style="color:#990012">เทหี,</span></i> or one who possesses the body, and the material body is called <i>deha, - <span style="color:#990012">เทห,</span></i> or the embodiment of the soul. The body is changing at every moment, but the soul is fixed; therefore the soul is called <i>kūṭa-stham. - <span style="color:#990012">กูฏ-สฺตฺหมฺ.</span></i> The change of body is enacted by the reactions of the three modes of nature. One who has understood the fixed position of the soul should not be disturbed by the incoming and outgoing interactions of the modes of material nature in the form of happiness and distress. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> also, Lord Kṛṣṇa recommends that since happiness and distress come and go due to the interaction of the modes of nature on the body, one should not be disturbed by such external movements. Even though one is sometimes absorbed in such external movements, he has to learn to tolerate them. The living entity should be always indifferent to the action and reaction of the external body.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31761" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Kṛṣṇa says in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that the body, made of the gross physical elements (earth, water, fire, air and sky) and the subtle elements (mind, intelligence and ego), is completely different from the soul proper. One should therefore not be disturbed by the action and reaction of these eight gross and subtle material elements. The practical process to attain this stage of indifference is to execute devotional service. Only one who constantly engages in devotional service twenty-four hours a day can be indifferent to the action and reaction of the external body. When a man is absorbed in a particular thought, he does not hear or see any external activities, even though they are enacted in his presence. Similarly, those who are fully absorbed in devotional service do not care what is going on with the external body. That status is called <i>samādhi - <span style="color:#990012">สมาธิ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">สมาธิ.</span></i> One who is actually situated in <i>samādhi</i> is understood to be a first-class <i>yogī. - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี.</span></i></p></div>

        <div id="bb31766" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The question may be raised that if the living entity has to act as the superintendent of the activities of the bodily combination, then how can he be indifferent to the activities of the body? The answer is given here: these activities are completely different from the activities of the spirit soul of the living entity. A crude example can be given in this connection: A businessman riding in a motorcar sits in the car, supervises its running and advises the driver. He knows how much gasoline is used up, and he knows everything about the car, but still he is apart from the car and is more concerned with his business. Even while riding in the car, he thinks of his business and his office. He has no connection with the car, although he is sitting there. As the businessman is always absorbed in thoughts of his business, so the living entity can be absorbed in thoughts of rendering loving service to the Lord. Then it will be possible to remain separate from the activities of the material body. This position of neutrality can be possible only for a devotee.</p></div>

Their aim of life is to give comfort to the body only. <i>Jñānīs - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานีสฺ</span></i> try to get out of entanglement by philosophical speculation, but they have no standing in the liberated position. Because they do not take shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord, they fall down from the exalted position of Brahman realization. <i>Yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> also have a bodily concept of life — they think that they can achieve something spiritual by exercising the body through <i>dhāraṇā, āsana, prāṇāyāma, - <span style="color:#990012">ธารณา, อาสน, ปฺราณายาม,</span></i> etc. A devotee’s position is always transcendental because of his intimate relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

        <div id="bb31772" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Here is an example of receiving direct instruction from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. One has to execute the order of Lord Viṣṇu, whether receiving it directly from Him or from His bona fide representative, the spiritual master. Arjuna fought the Battle of Kurukṣetra under the direct order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, here Pṛthu Mahārāja is also being given orders by Lord Viṣṇu regarding the execution of his duty. We have to stick to the principles stated in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā. - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา.</span></i> <i>Vyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">วฺยวสายาตฺมิกา พุทฺธิฮ:</span></i> every man’s duty is to receive orders from Lord Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide representative and take these orders as his life and soul, without personal considerations. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura states that one should not care very much whether he is going to be liberated or not, but he should simply execute the direct order received from the spiritual master. If one sticks to the principle of abiding by the order of the spiritual master, he will always remain in a liberated position. A common man must execute the rules and regulations of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span></i> by working in his prescribed duty according to the caste system (<i>brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ, กฺษตฺริย, ไวศฺย</span></i> and <i>śūdra - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span></i>) and the spiritual-order system (<i>brahmacarya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมจรฺย, คฺฤหสฺตฺห, วานปฺรสฺตฺห</span></i> and <i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span></i>). If one simply executes regularly and strictly the injunctions given for the different divisions of life, then one satisfies Lord Viṣṇu.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31773" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As a king, Pṛthu Mahārāja was ordered by Lord Viṣṇu to keep himself always aloof from the activities of the bodily situation and to engage always in the service of the Lord and thus keep himself in the liberated stage. The word <i>baddha-sauhṛdāḥ - <span style="color:#990012">พทฺธ-สะอุหฺฤทาฮ</span></i> in the previous verse is explained herewith. One can fully remain in intimate connection with the Supreme Lord directly or receive orders from His bona fide representative the spiritual master and execute the orders sincerely when one keeps aloof from the activities of the body. The Lord helps us by giving us directions how to act in devotional service and thus advance on the path back home, back to Godhead. He instructs us outwardly in the form of the spiritual master. Therefore, one should not accept the spiritual master as an ordinary human being. The Lord says, <i>ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāva-manyeta karhicit: - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยํ มาํ วิชานียานฺ นาว-เมนฺยต กรฺหิจิตฺ:</span></i> one should not treat the spiritual master as an ordinary human being, for he is the substitute for the Supreme Personality of Godhead (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 11.17.27). One should treat the spiritual master as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and never be envious of him or consider him to be an ordinary human being. If we follow the instruction of the spiritual master and execute devotional service to the Lord, we will remain always free from the contamination of bodily and material activities, and our life will be successful.</p></div>

And if things are to go on as they ought to, how can a head of state be indifferent to such activities? In answer to this question, the word <i>śreyaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">เศฺรยฮ,</span></i> “auspicious,” is used here. The division of activities in society as arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead was not blindly or accidentally created, as foolish people say. The <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> must do his duty properly, and the <i>kṣatriya, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย,</span></i> the <i>vaiśya - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺย</span></i> and even the <i>śūdra - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span></i> must do the same. And every one of them can achieve the highest perfection of life — liberation from this material bondage. This is confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (18.45). <i>Sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">เสฺว เสฺว กรฺมณฺยฺ อภิรตฮ สํสิทฺธิํ ลภเต นรฮ:</span></i> “By executing one’s prescribed duties, one can attain the highest perfection.”</p></div>

He can attain liberation while executing his royal duties. The royal duty or the duty of the head of state is to see that the <i>prajās,</i> or the general mass of people, are doing their respective duties for spiritual salvation. A secular state does not necessitate a king or head of state who is indifferent to the activities of the <i>prajās. - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรชาสฺ.</span></i> In the modern state the government has many rules and regulations for conducting the duties of the <i>prajās,</i> but the government neglects to see that the citizens advance in spiritual knowledge. If the government is careless in this matter, the citizens will act whimsically, without any sense of God realization or spiritual life, and thus become entangled in sinful activities.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31780" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>An executive head should not be callous to the welfare of the general mass of people while he simply goes on collecting taxes. The king’s real duty is to see that the citizens gradually become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. Kṛṣṇa conscious means completely free from all sinful activities. As soon as there is complete eradication of sinful activities in the state, then there will be no more war, pestilence, famine or natural disturbances. This was actually prevailing during the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. If a king or head of the government is able to induce the citizens to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he is worthy to rule over the mass of people; otherwise, he has no right to levy taxes. If the king looks after the spiritual interests of the citizens, he can levy taxes without difficulties. In this way both the subjects and the king will be happy during this life, and in the next life the king will be able to share one sixth of the pious activities of the citizens. Otherwise, by levying taxes on the sinful citizens, he will have to share the reactions of their sinful activities.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31781" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This same principle can be applied to parents and spiritual masters as well.

These subtle laws of nature are unknown to the present leaders of society. Since the leaders of society have a poor fund of knowledge and the citizens in general are rogues and thieves, there cannot be an auspicious situation for human society. At the present moment the whole world is full of such an incompatible combination of state and citizens, and therefore there is constant tension, war and anxiety as an inevitable result of such social conditions.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31786" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Viṣṇu advised King Pṛthu that everyone should follow the principles of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span> - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span>; - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span></i> then, in whatever capacity one remains within this material world, his salvation is guaranteed after death. In this age, however, since the system of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma</i> is topsy-turvy, it is very difficult to strictly follow all the principles. The only method for becoming perfect in life is to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As <i>varṇāśrama-dharma</i> is executed from different positions by different men, so the Kṛṣṇa consciousness principles can be followed by everyone in every part of the world.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31787" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There is a specific purpose in mentioning herein that one should follow the <i>dvijāgryas, - <span style="color:#990012">ทฺวิชาคฺรฺยสฺ,</span></i> the most prominent <i>brāhmaṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ,</span></i> like Parāśara and Manu. These great sages have already given us instructions on how to live according to the principles of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma. - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม.</span></i> Similarly, Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī have given us rules and regulations for becoming pure devotees of the Lord. It is essential, therefore, to follow the instructions of the <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> in the <i>paramparā - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา</span></i> system, who have received the knowledge as passed down from spiritual master to disciple. In this way, although living in our material condition of life, we can get out of the entanglement of material contamination without leaving our positions. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu advises, therefore, that one does not have to change his position. One simply has to hear from the perfect source (this is called <i>paramparā</i>) and follow the principles for practical application in life; thus one can attain the highest perfection of life — liberation — and go back home, back to Godhead. In other words, the change required is a change in consciousness, not in the body. Unfortunately, in this fallen age, people are concerned with the body, not with the soul. They have invented so many “isms” pertaining to the body only, not to the soul.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31788" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the modern age of democracy there are so many government representatives voting for legislation. Every day they bring out a new law. But because these laws are only mental concoctions manufactured by inexperienced conditioned souls, they cannot give relief to human society. Formerly, although the kings were autocrats, they strictly followed the principles laid down by great sages and saintly persons. There were no mistakes in ruling over the country, and everything went perfectly. The citizens were completely pious, the king levied taxes legitimately, and therefore the situation was very happy. At the present moment the so-called executive heads are more or less selected from materially ambitious persons who simply look after their own personal interests; they have no knowledge of the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> In other words, the executive heads are fools and rascals in the strict sense of the terms, and the people in general are <i>śūdras - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ.</span></i> This combination of fools and rascals and <i>śūdras</i> cannot bring about peace and prosperity in this world. Therefore we find periodic upheavals in society in the forms of battles, communal riots and fratricidal quarrels. Under these circumstances, not only are the leaders unable to lead the people toward liberation, but they cannot even give them peace of mind. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> it is stated that anyone who lives on concocted ideas, without reference to the <i>śāstras, - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ,</span></i> never becomes successful and does not attain happiness or liberation after death.</p></div>

The Lord openly says that performing great sacrifices or undergoing the austerities of mystic <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> practice cannot satisfy Him. He is pleased only by elevated character and behavior. But these cannot develop unless one becomes a pure devotee of the Lord. Anyone who has developed unalloyed, unflinching devotional service unto the Lord develops his original good qualities as spirit soul. The spirit soul, as part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has all the good qualities of the Lord. When the spirit soul is contaminated by the material modes of nature, one is considered good or bad with reference to the material qualities. But when one is transcendental to all material qualities, all the good qualities come out. These qualities of a devotee, twenty-six in number, are listed as follows: (1) kind to everyone, (2) does not quarrel with anyone, (3) fixed in the Absolute Truth, (4) equal to everyone, (5) faultless, (6) charitable, (7) mild, (8) clean, (9) simple, (10) benevolent, (11) peaceful, (12) completely attached to Kṛṣṇa, (13) has no material hankering, (14) meek, (15) steady, (16) self-controlled, (17) does not eat more than required, (18) sane, (19) respectful, (20) humble, (21) grave, (22) compassionate, (23) friendly, (24) poetic, (25) expert, (26) silent.

        <div id="bb31803" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are many cases in which a person becomes an offender to the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava and later becomes repentant. Here also we find that although the King of heaven, Indra, was so powerful that he accompanied Lord Viṣṇu, he felt himself a great offender for stealing Pṛthu Mahārāja’s horse that was meant for sacrifice. An offender at the lotus feet of a Vaiṣṇava is never excused by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many instances illustrating this fact. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja was offended by Durvāsā Muni, a great sage and mystic <i>yogī, - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี,</span></i> and Durvāsā also had to fall down at the lotus feet of Ambarīṣa Mahārāja.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31804" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Indra decided to fall down at the lotus feet of King Pṛthu, but the King was so magnanimous a Vaiṣṇava that he did not want Mahārāja Indra to fall down at his feet. Instead, King Pṛthu immediately picked him up and embraced him, and both of them forgot all the past incidents. Both King Indra and Mahārāja Pṛthu were envious and angry with each other, but since both of them were Vaiṣṇavas, or servants of Lord Viṣṇu, it was their duty to adjust the cause of their envy. This is also a first-class example of cooperative behavior between Vaiṣṇavas. In the present days, however, because people are not Vaiṣṇavas, they fight perpetually among one another and are vanquished without finishing the mission of human life. There is a great need to propagate the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in the world so that even though people sometimes become angry and malicious toward one another, because of their being Kṛṣṇa conscious such rivalry, competition and envy can be adjusted without difficulty.</p></div>

He was a great devotee and at the same time a great hero who conquered over all undesirable elements in his kingdom. He was so powerful that he was equal in fighting to Indra, the King of heaven. He gave protection to his citizens, keeping them engaged in pious activities and devotion to the Lord. He did not collect a single cent of taxes from the citizens without being able to give them protection from all calamities. The greatest calamity in life is to become godless and therefore sinful. If the state head or king allows the citizens to become sinful by indulging in illicit sex life, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, then the king is responsible, and he has to suffer the resultant sequence of reactions for the sinful lives of the citizens because he levies taxes on them unnecessarily. These are the principles for a ruling power, and because Mahārāja Pṛthu observed all the principles for a ruling chief, he is referred to here as <i>ādi-rājaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">อาทิ-ราชฮ.</span></i></p></div>

        <div id="bb31824" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Just today we have seen in the newspapers of Bombay that the government is going to repeal its prohibition laws. Ever since Gandhi’s noncooperation movement, Bombay has been kept dry and has not allowed its citizens to drink. But unfortunately the citizens are so clever that they have increased illicit distillation of liquor, and although not being sold publicly in shops, liquor is being sold in public lavatories and similar abnormal places. Unable to check such illicit smuggling, the government has decided to manufacture the liquor at cheaper prices so that people can have their supply of intoxication directly from the government instead of purchasing it in public lavatories. The government failed to change the hearts of the citizens from indulging in sinful life, so instead of losing the taxes they collect to inflate the treasury, they have decided to manufacture liquor to supply to the citizens who hanker after it.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31825" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This kind of government cannot check the resultant actions of sinful life, namely war, pestilence, famine, earthquakes and similar other disturbances. Nature’s law is that as soon as there are discrepancies in regard to the law of God (which are described in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> as <i>dharmasya glāniḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺมสฺย คฺลานิฮ,</span></i> or disobedience to the laws of nature or God), at once there will be heavy punishment in the form of sudden outbreaks of war. We have recently experienced a war between India and Pakistan. Within fourteen days there have been immense losses of men and money, and there have been disturbances to the entire world. These are the reactions of sinful life. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to make people pure and perfect. If we become even partially pure, as described in the <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (<i>naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu - <span style="color:#990012">นษฺฏ-ปฺราเยษฺวฺ อภเทฺรษุ</span></i>), by development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then lust and greed, the material diseases of the citizens, will be reduced. This can be made possible simply by broadcasting the pure message of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Big commercial and industrial firms have contributed many thousands of rupees to a defense fund that burns the money in the form of gunpowder, but unfortunately, if they are asked to contribute liberally to advance the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, they are reluctant. Under the circumstances, the world will periodically suffer from such upsurges and outbreaks of war, which are the consequences of not being Kṛṣṇa conscious.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31830" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The significant point in this verse is that the Lord was standing above the ground, almost touching it. The residents of the upper planetary systems, beginning from Brahmaloka (the planet where Lord Brahmā lives) down to Svargaloka (the heavenly planet of Indra), are so advanced in spiritual life that when they come to visit this or similar other lower planetary systems, they keep their weightlessness. This means that they can stand without touching the ground. Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because He lives in one of the planetary systems within this universe, He sometimes plays as if one of the demigods of this universe. When He first appeared before Pṛthu Mahārāja, He was not touching the ground of this earth, but when He was fully satisfied with the behavior and character of Mahārāja Pṛthu, He immediately acted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa from Vaikuṇṭha. Out of affection for Pṛthu Mahārāja, He touched the earth, but He rested the front of His hand on the raised shoulder of Garuḍa, His carrier, as if to prevent Himself from falling down, since the Lord is not accustomed to stand on earthly ground. These are all symptoms of His great affection for Pṛthu Mahārāja. Perceiving his fortunate position, Pṛthu Mahārāja could not fully look upon the Lord due to ecstasy, but still, in a faltering voice, he began to offer prayers.</p></div>

There are others, namely <i>jñānīs - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานีสฺ</span></i> and <i>yogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ,</span></i> who want the benediction of merging into the existence of the Lord.

Devotees are anxious neither for the heavenly planets nor for merging into the existence of the Lord. According to devotees, <i>kaivalya, - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺย,</span></i> or merging into the existence of the Lord, is considered as good as hell. The word <i>naraka - <span style="color:#990012">นรก</span></i> means “hell.” Similarly, everyone who exists in this material world is called <i>nāraka - <span style="color:#990012">นารก</span></i> because this material existence itself is known as a hellish condition of life. Pṛthu Mahārāja, however, expressed that he was interested neither in the benediction desired by the <i>karmīs</i> nor that desired by the <i>jñānīs</i> and <i>yogīs. - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ.</span></i> Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī Prabhu, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, described that <i>kaivalya</i> is no better than a hellish condition of life, and as for the delights of the heavenly planets, they are factually will-o’-the-wisps, or phantasmagoria. They are not wanted by devotees. Devotees do not even care for the positions held by Lord Brahmā or Lord Śiva, nor does a devotee desire to become equal with Lord Viṣṇu. As a pure devotee of the Lord, Pṛthu Mahārāja made his position very clear.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31840" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous verse Mahārāja Pṛthu addressed the Lord as <i>kaivalya - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺย</span>-pati, - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺย-ปติ,</span></i> the master of the liberation of merging into His existence. This does not mean that he was anxious for <i>kaivalya</i> liberation. That is made clear in this verse: “My dear Lord, I do not want such a benediction.” Mahārāja Pṛthu wanted to have a million ears to hear the glories of the lotus feet of the Lord. He specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord should emanate from the mouths of pure devotees, who speak from the cores of their hearts. It is stated in the beginning of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.1.3), <i>śuka-mukhād amṛta-drava-saṁyutam: - <span style="color:#990012">ศุก-มุขาทฺ อมฺฤต-ทฺรว-สํยุตมฺ:</span></i> the nectar of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> became more relishable because it emanated from the mouth of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī. One might think that these glories of the Lord can be heard from anywhere, from the mouths of either devotees or nondevotees, but here it is specifically mentioned that the glories of the Lord must emanate from the mouths of pure devotees. Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī has strictly prohibited hearing from the mouth of a nondevotee. There are many professional reciters of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> who speak the narrations very ornamentally, but a pure devotee does not like to hear from them because such glorification of the Lord is simply a vibration of material sound. But when heard from the mouth of a pure devotee, glorification of the Lord is immediately effective.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31841" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The words <i>satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvidaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">สตาํ ปฺรสงฺคานฺ มม วีรฺย-สํวิทฮ</span></i> (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 3.25.25) mean that glorification of the Lord is potent when uttered from the mouth of a pure devotee. The Lord has innumerable devotees all over the universe, and they have been glorifying the Lord since time immemorial and for an unlimited time. But still they cannot completely finish enumerating the glories of the Lord. Pṛthu Mahārāja therefore wanted innumerable ears, as Rūpa Gosvāmī also desired to have millions of ears and millions of tongues to chant and hear the glorification of the Lord. In other words, if our ears are always engaged in hearing the glorification of the Lord, there will be no scope for hearing the Māyāvāda philosophy, which is doom to spiritual progress. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that if anyone hears from a Māyāvādī philosopher preaching about the activities of the Lord, even if it is a description from the Vedic literature, he is ultimately doomed. By hearing such Māyāvāda philosophy one cannot come to the destination of spiritual perfection of life.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31846" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is explained in the previous verse that one has to hear glorification of the Lord from the mouth of a pure devotee. This is further explained here. The transcendental vibration from the mouth of a pure devotee is so powerful that it can revive the living entity’s memory of his eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In our material existence, under the influence of illusory <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> we have almost forgotten our eternal relationship with the Lord, exactly like a man sleeping very deeply who forgets his duties. In the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> it is said that every one of us is sleeping under the influence of <i>māyā. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i> We must get up from this slumber and engage in the right service, for thus we can properly utilize the facility of this human form of life. As expressed in a song by Ṭhākura Bhaktivinoda, Lord Caitanya says, <i>jīva jāgo, jīva jāgo. - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว ชาโค, ชีว ชาโค.</span></i> The Lord asks every sleeping living entity to get up and engage in devotional service so that his mission in this human form of life may be fulfilled. This awakening voice comes through the mouth of a pure devotee.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31847" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A pure devotee always engages in the service of the Lord, taking shelter of His lotus feet, and therefore he has a direct connection with the saffron mercy-particles that are strewn over the lotus feet of the Lord. Although when a pure devotee speaks the articulation of his voice may resemble the sound of this material sky, the voice is spiritually very powerful because it touches the particles of saffron dust on the lotus feet of the Lord. As soon as a sleeping living entity hears the powerful voice emanating from the mouth of a pure devotee, he immediately remembers his eternal relationship with the Lord, although up until that moment he had forgotten everything.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31848" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>For a conditioned soul, therefore, it is very important to hear from the mouth of a pure devotee, who is fully surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord without any material desire, speculative knowledge or contamination of the modes of material nature. Every one of us is <i>kuyogī - <span style="color:#990012">กุโยคี</span></i> because we have engaged in the service of this material world, forgetting our eternal relationship with the Lord as His eternal loving servants. It is our duty to rise from the <i>kuyoga - <span style="color:#990012">กุโยค</span></i> platform to become <i>suyogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">สุโยคีสฺ,</span></i> perfect mystics. The process of hearing from a pure devotee is recommended in all Vedic scriptures, especially by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One may stay in his position of life — it does not matter what it is — but if one hears from the mouth of a pure devotee, he gradually comes to the understanding of his relationship with the Lord and thus engages in His loving service, and his life becomes completely perfect. Therefore, this process of hearing from the mouth of a pure devotee is very important for making progress in the line of spiritual understanding.</p></div>

The word <i>ārya</i> refers to those who are advancing spiritually. In the history of the human race, the Āryan family is considered to be the most elevated community in the world because it adopts the Vedic civilization. The Āryan family is distributed all over the world and is known as Indo-Āryan. In prehistoric days all of the members of the Āryan family followed the Vedic principles, and therefore they became spiritually advanced. The kings, known as <i>rājarṣis, - <span style="color:#990012">ราชรฺษิสฺ,</span></i> were so perfectly educated as <i>kṣatriyas, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริยสฺ,</span></i> or protectors of the citizens, and so greatly advanced in spiritual life, that there was not a bit of trouble for the citizens.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31854" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The glorification of the Supreme Lord can be very much appreciated by the Āryan family. Although there is no bar for others, the members of the Āryan family very quickly catch the essence of spiritual life. How is it that we are finding it very easy to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness among the Europeans and Americans? History reports that the Americans and Europeans proved their capability when they were anxious to expand colonization, but at the present time, being contaminated by the advancement of material science, their sons and grandsons are turning into reprobates. This is due to their having lost their original spiritual culture, which is Vedic civilization. Presently these descendants of the Āryan family are taking this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement very seriously. Others who are associating with them and hearing the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <i>mahā-mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺร</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-มนฺตฺร</span></i> from the lips of pure devotees are also becoming captivated by the transcendental vibration. Transcendental vibrations are very much effective when chanted among Āryans, but even though one does not belong to the Āryan family, he will become a Vaiṣṇava simply by hearing the <i>mantra</i> because the vibration has great influence over everyone.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31855" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Mahārāja Pṛthu points out that even the goddess of fortune, who is the constant companion of Lord Nārāyaṇa, specifically wanted to hear about the Lord’s glories, and for the association of the <i>gopīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ,</span></i> who are pure devotees, the goddess of fortune, Lakṣmī, underwent severe austerities. The impersonalist may ask why one should bother chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <i>mahā-mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-มนฺตฺร</span></i> continually for so many years instead of stopping and trying for <i>kaivalya, - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺย,</span></i> liberation, or merging into the existence of the Lord. In answer, Mahārāja Pṛthu maintains that the attraction of this chanting is so great that one cannot give up the process unless he is an animal. This is the case even if one comes in contact with this transcendental vibration by chance. Pṛthu Mahārāja is very emphatic in this connection — only an animal can give up the practice of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Those who are not animals but actually intelligent, advanced, human, civilized men cannot give up this practice of continually chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.</p></div>

Consequently, Lord Viṣṇu is addressed here as <i>pūruṣottama, - <span style="color:#990012">ปูรุโษตฺตม,</span></i> the best of all living entities, namely <i>viṣṇu-tattvas - <span style="color:#990012">วิษฺณุ-ตตฺตฺวสฺ</span></i> and <i>jīva-tattva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-ตตฺตฺว</span>s. - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-ตตฺตฺวสฺ.</span></i> It is a great offense, therefore, to compare Lord Viṣṇu and the <i>jīva-tattva</i> or consider them on an equal level. The Māyāvādī philosophers equate the <i>jīvas - <span style="color:#990012">ชีวสฺ</span></i> and the Supreme Lord and consider them to be one, but that is the greatest offense to the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31862" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Here in the material world we have practical experience that a superior person is worshiped by an inferior one. Similarly, <i>pūruṣottama, - <span style="color:#990012">ปูรุโษตฺตม,</span></i> the greatest, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, or Lord Viṣṇu, is always worshiped by others. Pṛthu Mahārāja therefore decided to engage in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. Pṛthu Mahārāja is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Viṣṇu, but he is called a <i>śaktyāveśa - <span style="color:#990012">ศกฺตฺยาเวศ</span></i> incarnation. Another significant word in this verse is <i>guṇālayam, - <span style="color:#990012">คุณาลยมฺ,</span></i> which refers to Viṣṇu as the reservoir of all transcendental qualities. The Māyāvādī philosophers, in accordance with the impersonalistic view, take the Absolute Truth to be <i>nirguṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺคุณ,</span></i> “without qualities,” but actually the Lord is the reservoir of all good qualities. One of the most important qualities of the Lord is His inclination to His devotees, for which He is called <i>bhakta-vatsala. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺต-วตฺสล.</span></i> The devotees are always very much inclined to render service unto the lotus feet of the Lord, and the Lord is also very much inclined to accept loving service from His devotees. In that exchange of service there are many transcendental transactions, which are called transcendental qualitative activities. Some of the transcendental qualities of the Lord are that He is omniscient, omnipresent, all-pervasive, all-powerful, the cause of all causes, the Absolute Truth, the reservoir of all pleasures, the reservoir of all knowledge, the all-auspicious and so on.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31863" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Pṛthu Mahārāja desired to serve the Lord with the goddess of fortune, but this desire does not mean that he was situated on the platform of <i>mādhurya-rasa - <span style="color:#990012">รส</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">มาธุรฺย-รส.</span></i> The goddess of fortune is engaged in the service of the Lord in the <i>rasa</i> of <i>mādhurya, - <span style="color:#990012">มาธุรฺย,</span></i> conjugal love. Although her position is on the chest of the Lord, the goddess of fortune, in her position as a devotee, takes pleasure in serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Pṛthu Mahārāja was thinking only of the lotus feet of the Lord because he is on the platform of <i>dāsya-rasa, - <span style="color:#990012">ทาสฺย-รส,</span></i> or servitorship of the Lord. From the next verse we learn that Pṛthu Mahārāja was thinking of the goddess of fortune as the universal mother, <i>jagan-mātā. - <span style="color:#990012">ชคนฺ-มาตา.</span></i> Consequently there was no question of his competing with her on the platform of <i>mādhurya-rasa. - <span style="color:#990012">มาธุรฺย-รส.</span></i> Nonetheless he feared that she might take offense at his engaging in the service of the Lord. This suggests that in the absolute world there is sometimes competition between servitors in the service of the Lord, but such competition is without malice. In the Vaikuṇṭha worlds if a devotee excels in the service of the Lord, others do not become envious of his excellent service but rather aspire to come to the platform of that service.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31868" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Mother Lakṣmījī, the goddess of fortune, is well known for always massaging the lotus feet of Lord Nārāyaṇa. She is an ideal wife because she takes care of Lord Nārāyaṇa in every detail. She takes care not only of His lotus feet but of the household affairs of the Lord as well. She cooks nice foods for Him, fans Him while He eats, smoothes sandalwood pulp on His face and sets His bed and sitting places in the right order. In this way she is always engaged in the service of the Lord, and there is hardly any opportunity for any other devotee to intrude upon His daily activities. Pṛthu Mahārāja was therefore almost certain that his intrusion into the service of the goddess of fortune would irritate her and cause her to become angry with him. But why should mother Lakṣmī, the mother of the universe, be angry with an insignificant devotee like Pṛthu Mahārāja? All this was not very likely. Yet Pṛthu Mahārāja, just for his personal protection, appealed to the Lord to take his part. Pṛthu Mahārāja was engaged in performing the ordinary Vedic rituals and sacrifices according to <i>karma-kāṇḍa, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ,</span></i> or fruitive activities, but the Lord, being so kind and magnanimous, was ready to award Pṛthu Mahārāja the highest perfectional stage of life, namely devotional service.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31869" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When a person performs Vedic rituals and sacrifices, he does so to elevate himself to the heavenly planets. No one can become qualified to go back home, back to Godhead, by means of such sacrifices. But the Lord is so kind that He accepts a little insignificant service, and therefore it is stated in the <i>Viṣṇu Purāṇa - <span style="color:#990012">วิษฺณุ ปุราณ</span></i> that by following the principles of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span></i> one can satisfy the Supreme Lord. When the Lord is satisfied, the performer of sacrifices is elevated to the platform of devotional service. Pṛthu Mahārāja therefore expected that his insignificant service to the Lord would be accepted by Him as being greater than that of Lakṣmījī. The goddess of fortune is called <i>cañcalā, - <span style="color:#990012">จญฺจลา,</span></i> “restless,” because she is very restless and is always coming and going. So Pṛthu Mahārāja indicated that even though she might go away out of anger, there would be no harm for Lord Viṣṇu, because He is self-sufficient and can do anything and everything without the help of Lakṣmījī. For example, when Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu begot Lord Brahmā from His navel, He did not take any help from Lakṣmī, who was just sitting by Him and massaging His lotus feet. Generally if a son is to be begotten, the husband impregnates the wife, and in due course of time the son is born. But in the case of Lord Brahmā’s birth, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu did not impregnate Lakṣmījī. Being self-sufficient, the Lord begot Brahmā from His own navel. Therefore, Pṛthu Mahārāja was confident that even if the goddess of fortune became angry with him there would be no harm, neither to the Lord nor to himself.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31880" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a great <i>ācārya - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย</span></i> of the Gauḍīya <i>sampradāya, - <span style="color:#990012">สมฺปฺรทาย,</span></i> has said that persons who are very much attached to the fruitive activities of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> namely <i>karma-kāṇḍa - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ</span></i> and <i>jñāna-kāṇḍa - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-กาณฺฑ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-กาณฺฑ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-กาณฺฑ,</span></i> are certainly doomed. In the <i>Vedas</i> there are three categories of activities, known as <i>karma-kāṇḍa</i> (fruitive activities), <i>jñāna-kāṇḍa</i> (philosophical research) and <i>upāsanā-kāṇḍa - <span style="color:#990012">อุปาสนา-กาณฺฑ</span></i> (worship of different demigods for receiving material benefits). Those who are engaged in <i>karma-kāṇḍa</i> and <i>jñāna-kāṇḍa</i> are doomed in the sense that everyone is doomed who is entrapped by this material body, whether it is a body of a demigod, a king, a lower animal or whatever. The sufferings of the threefold miseries of material nature are the same for all. Cultivation of knowledge to understand one’s spiritual position is also, to a certain extent, a waste of time. Because the living entity is an eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, his immediate business is to engage himself in devotional service. Pṛthu Mahārāja therefore says that the allurement of material benedictions is another trap to entangle one in this material world. He therefore frankly tells the Lord that the Lord’s offerings of benedictions in the form of material facilities are certainly causes for bewilderment. A pure devotee is not at all interested in <i>bhukti - <span style="color:#990012">ภุกฺติ</span></i> or <i>mukti. - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ.</span></i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31881" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord sometimes offers benedictions to the neophyte devotees who have not yet understood that material facilities will not make them happy. In the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span></i> the Lord therefore says that a sincere devotee who is not very intelligent may ask some material benefit from the Lord, but the Lord, being omniscient, does not generally give material rewards but, on the contrary, takes away whatever material facilities are being enjoyed by His devotee, so that ultimately the devotee will completely surrender unto Him. In other words, the offering of benedictions in the form of material profit is never auspicious for the devotee. The statements of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> which offer elevation to heavenly planets in exchange for great sacrifices are simply bewildering. Therefore in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (2.42) the Lord says, <i>yām imāṁ puṣpitāṁ vācaṁ pravadanty avipaścitaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">อวิปศฺจิตฮ</span>: - <span style="color:#990012">ยามฺ อิมาํ ปุษฺปิตาํ วาจํ ปฺรวทนฺตฺยฺ อวิปศฺจิตฮ:</span></i> the less intelligent class of men (<i>avipaścitaḥ</i>), attracted by the flowery language of the <i>Vedas, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> engage in fruitive activities to become materially benefited. Thus they continue life after life, in different bodily forms, to search very, very hard.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31906" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Most important in this verse are the words <i>pratinandyārthavad vacaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรตินนฺทฺยารฺตฺหวทฺ วจฮ,</span></i> which indicate that the Lord appreciated the very meaningful prayers of the King. When a devotee prays to the Lord, it is not to ask for material benefits but to ask the Lord for His favor; he prays that he may be engaged in the service of the Lord’s lotus feet birth after birth. Lord Caitanya therefore uses the words <i>mama janmani janmani, - <span style="color:#990012">มม ชนฺมนิ ชนฺมนิ,</span></i> which mean “birth after birth,” because a devotee is not even interested in stopping the repetition of birth. The Lord and the devotee appear in this material world birth after birth, but such births are transcendental. In the Fourth Chapter of <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> the Lord informed Arjuna that both He and Arjuna had undergone many, many births previously, but the Lord remembered everything about them whereas Arjuna had forgotten. The Lord and His confidential devotees appear many times to fulfill the Lord’s mission, but since such births are transcendental, they are not accompanied by the miserable conditions of material birth, and they are therefore called <i>divya, - <span style="color:#990012">ทิวฺย,</span></i> transcendental.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb31907" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>One must understand the transcendental birth of the Lord and the devotee. The purpose of the Lord’s taking birth is to establish devotional service, which is the perfect system of religion, and the purpose of the birth of a devotee is to broadcast the same system of religion, or the <i>bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> cult, all over the world. Pṛthu Mahārāja was an incarnation of the power of the Lord to spread the <i>bhakti</i> cult, and the Lord blessed him to remain fixed in his position. Thus when the King refused to accept any material benediction, the Lord appreciated that refusal very much. Another significant word in this verse is <i>acyuta, - <span style="color:#990012">อจฺยุต,</span></i> which means “infallible.” Although the Lord appears in this material world, He is never to be considered one of the conditioned souls, who are all fallible. When the Lord appears, He remains in His spiritual position, uncontaminated by the modes of material nature, and therefore in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> the Lord expresses the quality of His appearance as <i>ātma-māyayā, - <span style="color:#990012">อาตฺม-มายยา,</span></i> “performed by internal potency.” The Lord, being infallible, is not forced by material nature to take birth in this material world. He appears in order to reestablish the perfect order of religious principles and to vanquish the demoniac influence in human society.</p></div>

        <div id="bb31913" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In modern so-called scientific society the idea is very prevalent that there is no life on other planets but that only on this earth do living entities with intelligence and scientific knowledge exist. The Vedic literatures, however, do not accept this foolish theory. The followers of Vedic wisdom are fully aware of various planets inhabited by varieties of living entities such as the demigods, the sages, the Pitās, the Gandharvas, the Pannagas, the Kinnaras, the Cāraṇas, the Siddhas and the Apsarās. The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> give information that in all planets — not only within this material sky but also in the spiritual sky — there are varieties of living entities. Although all these living entities are of one spiritual nature, in quality the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they have varieties of bodies due to the embodiment of the spirit soul by the eight material elements, namely earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego. In the spiritual world, however, there is no such distinction between the body and the embodied. In the material world, distinctive features are manifested in different types of bodies in the various planets. We have full information from the Vedic literature that in each and every planet, both material and spiritual, there are living entities of varied intelligence. The earth is one of the planets of the Bhūrloka planetary system. There are six planetary systems above Bhūrloka and seven planetary systems below it. Therefore the entire universe is known as <i>caturdaśa-bhuvana, - <span style="color:#990012">จตุรฺทศ-ภุวน,</span></i> indicating that it has fourteen different planetary systems. Beyond the planetary systems in the material sky, there is another sky, which is known as <i>paravyoma, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรโวฺยม,</span></i> or the spiritual sky, where there are spiritual planets. The inhabitants of those planets engage in varieties of loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which include different <i>rasas, - <span style="color:#990012">รสสฺ,</span></i> or relationships, known as <i>dāsya-rasa, sakhya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa, mādhurya-rasa - <span style="color:#990012">ทาสฺย-รส, สขฺย-รส, วาตฺสลฺย-รส, มาธุรฺย-รส</span></i> and, above all, <i>parakīya-rasa. - <span style="color:#990012">ปรกีย-รส.</span></i> This <i>parakīya-rasa, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรกีย-รส,</span></i> or paramour love, is prevalent in Kṛṣṇaloka, where Lord Kṛṣṇa lives. This planet is also called Goloka Vṛndāvana, and although Lord Kṛṣṇa lives there perpetually, He also expands Himself in millions and trillions of forms. In one of such forms He appears on this material planet in a particular place known as Vṛndāvana-dhāma, where He displays His original pastimes of Goloka Vṛndāvana-dhāma in the spiritual sky in order to attract the conditioned souls back home, back to Godhead.</p></div>

When a living entity falls down to the material world, however, he has to accept a material body, and therefore, in his material embodiment, he cannot be called <i>acyuta. - <span style="color:#990012">อจฺยุต.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อจฺยุต.</span></i> Because he falls down from his real engagement in the service of the Lord, the living entity gets a material body to suffer or try to enjoy in the miserable material conditions of life. Therefore the fallen living entity is <i>cyuta,</i> whereas the Lord is called <i>acyuta.</i> The Lord was attractive for everyone — not only the King but also the priestly order, who were very much addicted to the performance of Vedic rituals. Because the Lord is all-attractive, He is called Kṛṣṇa, or “one who attracts everyone.” The Lord appeared in the sacrificial arena of Mahārāja Pṛthu as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is a plenary expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa. He is the second incarnation from Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is the origin of material creation and who expands as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who then enters into each and every universe. Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is one of the <i>puruṣas - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษสฺ</span></i> who control the material modes of nature.</p></div>
