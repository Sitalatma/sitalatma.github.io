<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			The seizure of Kāmadhenu, the Sacred Cow, causes anxiety in her and 
			she urges Vashishta to counteract the atrocity of Vishvamitra. Agreeing 
			to her, the sage asks the Cow to create a force that can subdue the 
			forces of Vishvamitra. Accordingly, that Cow generates newer forces 
			and a war ensues.</p>

This is the relevant stanza for the later time debates or essay competitions under 
the caption of &#39;pen vs. sword... which is mightier...&#39; Here, though Vishvamitra 
is well aware that a sage&#39;s possession cannot be usurped, he resorted to the same. 
The Sacred Cow is telling the above with intolerance towards Vishvamitra&#39;s violation 
of the norms. <em>sā api asahamānā kāma dohinī shāntyā kṣhamayā yuktam vashiṣhṭam avocat

What a king has got to do with a sage&#39;s wealth? A sage acquires it with his ascesis

shall not be robbed off his possession, which he acquires by his personal merit.

see the greedy to fail and thus insulted of their might.</p>

The Barbara-s are said in this text whereas other mms contain it as &quot;Pahlava-s&#39;. 
Even on taking Barbara-s, they are an outlandish clan and the word &#39;Barbara&#39; might 
have been the ancestor word of the present day &#39;Barbarian.&#39;</p>
