<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 67<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Restored to confidence by Angada, all the monkeys return to the battle-field. Dvivida, a leader of the monkeys hurls a mountain
towards Kumbhakarna, but it misses the target and falls on horses, elephants and chariots of the enemy. Dvivida hurls another mountain and some
demons are killed. Hanuma strikes Kumbhakarna with a large mountain-peak and injures him severely. In reply, Kumbhakarna strikes on Hanuma's chest
with his spike. Then, Kumbhakarna strikes other monkey-chiefs who attack him. Thousands of monkeys then ascend Kumbhakarna's body and encounters him
with their nails, fists, teeth and arms. In response, Kumbhakarna destroys all those monkeys with his spike. When Angada, the leader of the monkeys,
attacks Kumbhakarna, the latter strikes Angada violently and Angada falls unconscious. Then, Kumbhakarna begins his attack on Sugreeva. But, Sugreeva
strikes Kumbhakarna's chest with a mountain, but the mountain only breaks into pieces. When Kumbhakarna throws his spike towards Sugreeva in
retaliation, Hanuma stops it on the way and breaks it off. Then, Kumbhakarna hurls a mountian-crust on Sugreeva to make him unconscious and takes him
away on his shoulders to Lanka. When Sugreeva regains consciousness, he tears off the ears and nose of Kumbhakarna with his sharp nails and teeth. In
relation, Kumbhakarna thren Sugreeva down and crushed him. Then Sugreeva bounces into the air and gets re united with Rama. Kumbhakarna thereafter
takes his hammer and begins to attack the monkeys and bears. Then, Lakshmana starts to attack Kumbhakarna with his arrows. But, Kumbhakarna
appreciates the valour of Lakshmana and proceeds towards Rama to fight with him. Rama discharges some arrows with 'Roundra' spell towards
Kumbhakarna. Those arrows disappear into Kumbhakarna's chest and make him weapon-less. In retaliation, Kumbhakarna hurls a mountain-peak towards Rama
and even before the mountain-peak reaches Rama, it was split up into pieces by the arrows released by Rama. Thereupon, on the advice given by
Lakshmana, all the monkeys climb straight upon Kumbhakarna's body. Kumbhakarna shakes them off with violence. Then, Rama employs a great missile and
chops off one arm of Kumbhakarna. When Kumbhakarna with an uprooted tree in his arm, retailiates by running towards Rama, the latter with an arrow,
presided over by Indra, hurls it on the former and chops off the second arm of Kumbhakarna, Rama then chops off the feet of Kumbhakarna with his
arrows and finally slashes off his head.</p>
