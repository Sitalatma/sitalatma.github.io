<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  I'm trying to create a digital version of Thai Bhagavad Gita. By "digital version" I mean a simple text file from which we can later create websites or apps for mobile phones or, indeed, actual digital books. I'm not an expert in any of these fields but if we come to such experts we need to give them a source, some content which they can then convert into a book or an app. I'm working on such content. I assume there's no need to explain why this digital version would be very benefitial and, in fact, necessary in the modern age when everyone consumes information on their digital devices - phones, computers, tablets, whatever. This website itself was created from this simple text file already. Everyday I try to post a Bhagavad Gita quote taken from here into our Line group and I want to find a way to make those quotes with a nice background - people like to share quotes with pictures, like here:

  <p>
  Digital books, btw, when published by BBT, can be sold on Amazon or Apple iBooks or Google Playbook stores. They might not be very popular in Thailand but buying and downloading a book from these is very very easy and they work here just fine. In countries like the US or in Europe Amazon can even print a paper book from their digital version in half an hour and then deliver it to the customer the next day. Small publishers, therefore, don't need to print 10,000 copies to bring down costs and then worry about their storage - Amazon will print each order individually and the price is very reasonable. Maybe there are Thai people in those countries who would want to order a paper Bhagavad Gita but, currently, we can't reach them or it would take forever to send them books from Thailand. This page is not about book publishing, however, but about creating a simple text file which can be processed in a variety of ways and one of the main requirements for this text is for it be in Unicode.
  </p>
</div>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Unicode</h1>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  Unicode is a kind of an international standard alphabet that includes all other alphabets. Right now there are some 10,000 letters in it already and they add more all the time. Thai alphabet starts at #3584 and goes to #3711. Usually unicode characters are numbered in "U+0E01" kind of format. Devanagari block is from "U+0900" to "U+097F", for example. Each letter in unicode also has a unique name, like "Thai Character Ko Kai", and these names follow standards set in their countries. In Thailand it's Royal Thai General System of Transcription which is then followed by international ISO 11940-2. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  Following these standards is important because while we can create any random text in our source, once we pass it out to be made into a website or an app this text will be processed by a "rendering engine" which expects standard input. In fact, everytime you see something on your screen it has been processed by some rendering engine so that what you read fits on your screen, letters are of a certain size and color and so on. If we pass non-standard text then we can't predict how rendering engines will show it. They all have their own ways of dealing with exceptions and even if it looks okay today Google might update Chrome browser tomorrow and it will become broken. Or it might look okay on my computer but broken on somebody's phone. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  For example, when creating my text file I can give a command like this:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  print chr(3584);
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  It means find unicode character #3584 and print it, whatever it is. It's actually "Thai Character Ko Kai". Then I can give two more commands to print "Thai Character Sara I" and then "Thai Character Sara Ii":
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  print chr(3636);
  <br />
  print chr(3637);
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  This means now I will have Ko Kai and then Sara I on top, and then Sara Ii on top again. How will it look? I don't know. I can't type this sequence on a keyboard - it's non-standard and it won't be accepted. In the browser it might show a white square, also known as "tofu". Or it might look okay but look broken on a phone. Even if it looks okay - can people actually read it? Does it make sense to them? The point is - we need to follow standards or all kinds of things will go wrong for our readers. This brings me to the actual topic of this page - transliteration
  </p>
</div>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Transliteration</h1>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  From the very beginning Srila Prabhupada included transliteration of Sanskrit verses in his books. He wanted western readers to read these verses outloud and repeating slokas in chorus has become standard in our Bhagavatam or Bhagavad Gita classes. Transliteraton is needed to enable people to read these words in their own language but the point is that it should sound as close to Sanskrit as possible. To further help people every BBT book has a section on how to pronounce those transliterated symbols they've never seen before - ś or ṣ or ā. It looks a bit too much in the beginning but eventually people get it and it becomes a second nature. So, we have to make it easier but some effort is still required.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  When I googled for "Thai transliteration" most of the results deal with making it easier for foreigners to recognize Thai words, especially place names. This is a different goal from ours - we want people to read exact sounds, not make it easy. Royal Thai system I mentioned above, for example, skips transliterating tone marks and skips long vowels. This is easy to read but cannot be converted from English back to Thai - because tone marks have already been lost, to start with.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  Google Translate uses a different scheme and you might have seen it if you used it on a desktop. It's a "true" transliteration - every letter has only one equivalent and Thai and English can be transliterated back and forth without any loss. If you have actually seen it, however, is practically unreadable in English, something like this: Kār thạbṣ̄ạphth̒ . I don't think even Thai speakers can easily guess what it means - การทับศัพท์, which is how Google translated "transliteration". This is an example of another extremity - it's correct but too difficult to read. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  In any case, we need Thai transliteration of Sanskrit words. In slokas we can look at Devanagari but quotes in purports are given only in English, and so are words like "varnashrama" appearing in the text. And it's not plain English but English transliteration of Devanagari and I think there's an important point to grasp here - they are both equivalent, one is not techinically better than the other. Let me explain - Sanskrit is an oral language and Devanagari is a script to record it. It's the most widely known, sure, but it's not the only one. Sanskrit itself can be written in many other scripts without losing its spiritual potency which comes from hearing it. Considere this example: everyone is familiar with this Thai stone inscription, which is the oldest evidence of Thai language:

            </div>



<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  Similarly, there's this famous "Heliodor Column" inscription in India which is the oldest written record of worship of Lord Vishnu:

            </div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  The translation is:<br />"This Garuda-standard of Vāsudeva, the God of Gods 
was erected here by the devotee Heliodoros,
the son of Dion, a man of Taxila,
sent by the Great Yona King
Antialkidas, as ambassador to
King Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior
son of the princess from Varanasi, in the fourteenth year of his reign."
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  Please note that it's written not in Devanagari but in "Brahmi" script, which academics think appeared first. Doesn't matter whether they are right or wrong, the fact is that there are about 50 scripts around India and South East Asia that can record Sanskrit perfectly fine and Thai is happened to be one of them - no Devanagari needed, strictly speaking. It's not my place to lecture Thai speakers but I believe they all know that many of Thai letters are of Sanskrit origin so there's no need to invent anything new, like they did with ś in English. The problem is that these letters are not used in modern Thai anymore even though they are still a part of Thai alphabet and everyone remembers their names, and that their pronunciation has changed so they don't sound like original Sanskrit anymore. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  This creates a problem to overcome. On one hand Thai language has Sanskrit words like "Suvarnabhumi" or "mantra" and everyone can read them but they don't sound like Sanskrit so it doesn't help our main purpose - make people recite actual Sanskrit words. Some other approach is needed instead.
  </p>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">

   One of the main changes in Thai is disappearance of voiced aspirated consonants like bha, gha, dha etc. They appear very often in Sanskrit and in the current Thai transliteration in Bhagavad Gita a little "hack" is used, as I understand. Instead of using old Sanskrit letter for "bha", for example, there's an ordinary "ba" but with a small dot below. A vowel then can go on top, like in the word "buddhi", or, if the vowel has to go below, like "u" in the word "sadhu", then instead of a dot there's a little circle above. With a little practice people can figure out what it means and how to read it.

  This creates a problem with standards, however. First, a little dot above in the text is using unicode character <a href="https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/f711/index.htm">U+F711</a>. if you follow this link it will say that it's not a valid unicode character, even if it's displayed properly on that page (at least in my browser). If I leave it as it is in the text file it also shows up moved about one-two characters to the right, not above the letter it was meant to be. Likewise, dots below are sometimes made using similar unicode characters way out of normal range. Both of these have regular Thai characters, though - Nikkhahit นิคหิต and Pinthu พินทุ. The problem is that Pinthu, for example, cannot be used when there's a vowel on top, like in "buddhi" above. It's a non-standard combination that can't be typed on a keyboard and doesn't show correctly on iPhones, Firefox, Safari, IE 10 - it's unpredictable mess and this is the main thing that needs to be fixed at the moment.<br />
  <em>Update:</em>Perhaps I should mention that these tho characters appear some 2,600 times in the text, always used in a non-standard way, as far as I know, and about 800 times out of these they are not displayed properly - when they are happened to be combined with vowels. It means that on average there's something wrong with every verse - something needs to be done about this.
  </p>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  I hope there could be another way to deal with "bha" and "dha" without using non-standard means and, hopefully, I can implement it right away. In the long term, however, I propose another, far more radical solution of overhauling the whole transliteration scheme used in our Thai Bhagavad Gita. I got this idea from reading this on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_alphabet#Sanskrit_and_Pali">Wikipedia</a>:
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  "This is an example of a Pali text written using the Thai Sanskrit orthography: อรหํ สมฺมาสมฺพุทฺโธ ภควา [arahaṃ sammāsambuddho bhagavā]. Written in modern Thai orthography, this becomes อะระหัง สัมมาสัมพุทโธ ภะคะวา arahang sammasamphuttho phakhawa."
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  In the first example there are both Nikkhahit and Pinthu and they are used in a standard way - Nikkhahit is Thai letter of ṁ in oṁ and Pinthu is a signal to drop inherent vowel, a signal that there's a consonant cluster coming. The rules for reading there differ from Thai but there's basically one rule - inherent vowels are always "a" and never anything else. Plus bha and gha should be voiced and aspirated. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  Second example looks easier to read for Thai speakers but at the same time pronunciation becomes different from intended. Either way is considered standard in Unicode but I can't say how they are used in actual Thai books transliterating Pali (or Sanskrit). 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  I can give another reason in favor of changing transliteration scheme but it might not be very valid. Right now there appears to be some inconsitency in transliterating those "bha" letters - it "บฺ" is Sri Bhagavan uvaca in the first picture above but the same "bha" in Bhagavad Gita it's ภควัต-คีตา - the old Sanskrit letter is used instead. Likewise, sometimes I've see "au" spelled with Thai vowel "o" and sometimes with "au". In BG 2.13 <a href="bg/2/13">here</a> in "kaumaram yauvanam jara" it's โคมารัม โยวะนัม จะรา but in <a href="bg/3/9">BG 3.9</a> "kaunteya" is คะอุนเทยะ, and if you follow this 3.9 link, on the same third line I have "tofu" in my browser where should be the word "arthaṁ". This one comes out wrong because of Pinthu below is used with "a" on top of "h", I guess. Anyway, maybe there's a reason why "au" sometimes is Thai "โ" and sometimes "คะ" but for now it looks inconsistent even if people probably have no problems reading it. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  At first my proposition might sound like a lot of work - transliterating all Sanskrit words in Bhagavad Gita again - but actually it isn't. This transliteration scheme is truly reversible, there's one-to-one mapping with Devanagari so, once the rules are laid out, it's super easy to transliterate all Devanagari in all the verses. I've already had a first run <a href="translitTh.html">here</a> using this <a href="dictDevTh.html">dictionary</a>. I suppose some vowels like Thai "o" and "ai" need to be moved in front of consonant clusters but the idea is that transliterating everything at once is not very difficult. Just make a change in the dictionary and in a second it will be applied to all transliterations everywhere.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph">
  <p>
  On that verse page you can see that I transliterated Devanagari into English as well. The purpose behind it is that now I can easily compare this transliteration with the one used in our books and make necessary adjustments, like splitting Sanskrit words in the right places. Once that is done this same dictionary can be used for English-Thai transliteratioin as well, it will be standard and reversible and everytime there's Sanskrit word in the text or there's a sloka quoted in the purport transliteration can be done automatically because all these words are already marked as being in Sansksrit (they are always in italics). It might take me some time to get everything right but not nearly as much as sitting down and changing transliterations manually.

  In the meantime, as I said, I'm waiting for a quick solution to Nikkhahits and Pinthus being used in a non-standard way.
