Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Vasishta gives details of the creation of the world to Sri Rama. He says that Brahma, 
in the form of a boar caused the earth to rise from water and from Brahma is created the entire world. 
He recites the Genealogy of Rama&#39;s line. He informs that Aja and Suvrata were the two sons of Nabhaga 
and it was Aja who begot the virtuous King Dasaratha; Rama&#39;s father. Vasishta also informs Rama that 
i the whole of Ikshvaku race, only the eldest son becomes the king. He requests Sri Rama not to violate 
this tradition and take over the reins of Ayodhya.</p>
