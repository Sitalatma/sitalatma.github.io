<h1><a href="index.html">Valmiki Ramayana</a></h1>
<h2>Kishkindha kanda</h2>



<br><h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy ṃonkeys</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 24<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Sugreeva and Tara lament Vali&#39;s death. Sugreeva seeks permission of Rama to enter the funeral pyre of 
his brother Vali to self-immolate himself for his wrongdoing in getting his own brother killed. Tara 
asks Rama to kill her with the same arrow with which Vali is killed, so that she too can go to heavens 
to meet her husband.</p>

<p class="tat">
A word about this chapter. The bardic tradition is in the habit of including everything, while the critical 
editions exclude anything arbitrary. This chapter is excluded in the critical editions, but traditional 
versions retained it, and all publications publish this. The scholars have also said that all the forty-four 
verses in here have no stamp of Valmiki, the verbiage and verbosity are heightened, even the meter is 
overfilled, and even the word positioning does not yield proper meaning. Even so, all are retained in 
all publications. However, it may be mentioned that if some Valmiki Jr. written and included this chapter, 
it should have been ages before, but not in the known ages, because Dharmākūtam, Govindaraja and others 
have commentaries on chapter. In all the commentaries an exhaustive commentary is there on two verses 
uttered by Tara, which is included here also.</p>

ṃythical parable: Once Brihaspati, the Jupiter and the Divine Counsellor of Indra was irritated at Indra 
and went in hiding for some days. Then gods have fetched one named Vishvarupa, a son of Tvaṣṭa, where 
Tvaṣṭa himself is Brahma&#39;s brainchild, and made Vishvarūpa to sit on the high seat of Brihaspati. This 
Vishvarupa becoming partial to demons used to give portions of ritual oblations to demons. Knowing this 
Indra kills Vishvarupa, and thus gets attached to sin called <em>brahma pātaka pāpa,</em> sin for slaying a 
Brahman.</p>

ṃyth: Indra seeks the help of earth, trees, waters and women to get rid of the sin of Brahman-slaying 
when he killed Vishvarupa, the son of Tvaṣṭa. These four in turn barter with Indra for some boons to 
them. Earth wanted automatic refill of dugout portions, trees wanted regrowth of cut branches, waters 
wanted an all purifying effect, and women wanted to have never decreasing sexual desire. When Indra 
agreed to these conditions, then the earth has taken a part of Indra&#39;s sin by which it acquired sinful 
wastelands, waters got froth, trees exudation, and women menstruation. This is as detailed in <em>bhāgavata

we know by our mental faculties? Even that is impossible for us, because you are
<em>durāsadaḥ</em> &#39; an inaccessible entity...&#39; <em>dur ā sada</em> 
the root <em>sad - Sa d`al`</em> after two preverbs <em>dur, ā</em> 
, has three meanings <em>Sa d`al` visharaṇa gati avasāneṣu</em> 1]
<em>visharaṇa= jīrṇatvam, shidhilatvam</em> perish, pine away; 2]
<em>gati= gamana</em> dynamism. For this ṃonier William&#39;s lexicon has no equalling 
word, but recorded in there is the word, &#39;watch, wait for&#39; an act in the nature of dynamism; 3]
<em>avasādana</em> ruin, distress, depression. Then she said this way, &#39;because 
you are eternal there is no perish, because you are ever dynamic no impasse can occur, because you are 
ever blissful no depression can occur, either to you or to your administration of dharma...&#39; This is 
what is told in Bhagavad-Gita at 11-53: <em>na aham vedaiḥ na tapasā na dānena na

but we are all accessible to you, can you excite yourself to grab this kingdom or the females or riches 
in it? You cannot do so, because you are <em>jitendriyaḥ</em> &#39;one with his senses 
conquered...&#39; You will give away all this to Sugreeva. You are said to be not eyeing at other&#39;s wives.
<em>na rāmaḥ para dāran vai cakshubhyām api pashyate</em> then how you eye at 
us? You cannot.&#39; This goes with the saying of <em>shveta ashvatara upanishad, 3-19: 
apāṇi pādo javano grahītā pashyatya cakshuḥ na shṛiṇoti karnaḥ</em> &#39;no hands no legs, He goes 
everywhere, no ears no eyes He sees everything...&#39; Thus the sensory organs and their activities are 
for the mortals, immortal is beyond them. Thus you have conquered all such physicality.&#39;</p>

but you are <em>uttama dhārmikaḥ</em> supreme among the righteous souls, because 
you have helped Sugreeva without any personal greed...&#39; A person who undertakes and does a deed only 
for himself is a base-level righteous person. One, who does so for his benefit, and for the benefit 
of a few others, is a middle-level righteous one. And a highest level righteous one undertakes anything 
to protect righteousness alone. In killing Vali, Rama has got only one point in view, &#39;to eliminate 
an abuser of tradition, <em>cāritra dūṣaka...</em> and not even bothering for 
the searchers of Seetha. When Rama can eliminate fourteen thousand demons of Khara in Aranya Kanda and 
also when he can put the sea to turmoil, can he not fling his arrow to the other side of that ocean 
to kill Ravana? He can, but he has to course through Sugreeva&#39;s friendship to punish Vali, among other 
things. &#39;So you are supreme among these kinds of benefactors, because you have paved way to Vali to 
go to heavens instead of netherworlds... so no discredit ensues...&#39;</p>

extol you...&#39; This is what is available in Bhagavad-Gita at 15-15 <em>vedaiḥ ca sarvaiḥ 
aham eva vedyo</em> &#39;by all Veda-s, I alone can be known...&#39; and the Vedic saying

Ravana the abductor of your wife, when you have seen Seetha&#39;s ornaments as at 4-6-25. That analogy is 
not shown here in Kishkindha. When Sugreeva examined your capacity, you also examined the capacities 
of Vali and Sugreeva in their first round of fight. Because Sugreeva prayed for your mercy you simply 
did not kill Vali, but a calculated approach is adopted by you, in the second round, and hence you are

It is said that Tara is pacified by this single assurance of Rama 
that Angada will not be looked down, or banished, or killed by the forthcoming regime, and she is self-assured 
that Rama effectuates his promise. Not only this but her status of an empress is also protected because 
Sugreeva remarries her. Can a Hindu woman remarry? Yes she can, and should.

There are some more rulings besides this. A woman is at liberty 
to remarry under &#39;certain&#39; circumstances. It appears that Tara is given equally to Vali and Sugreeva 
by gods, like Draupadi to Pandava-s. But in such wife-sharing system some strict rules are to be observed 
like time, months, years, turns etc., as has been done by Pandava-s. That was lacking with Vali. Vali&#39;s 
thinking is that Sugreeva wants Tara more than Kishkindha, so Vali did not kill Sugreeva but chased 
him away from Kishkindha, presuming the begrudging of Sugreeva is too trivial. The actual cause of rivalry 
between these two is Tara. But this cannot be over stated. Sugreeva informs Rama while narrating episode 
of Dundubhi, &#39;due to some woman there was a rivalry...&#39; Sugreeva too does not overstate this. This is 
as per Govindaraja commentary.</p>

Regarding the chastity of Tara no doubt is to be expressed by 
any for she is a celestial, emerged from the churning of ṃilky Ocean. She is equated with Seetha, Draupadi, 
Ahalya, and listening their episodes is said to remove any evil-visualisations, as in this verse:</font></p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>44. prabhāva yuktena</em> = persuasion, one who has; <em>param tapena</em> = by enemy-burner;
<em>mahatmanā</em> = by noble-souled one; <em>tena</em> = by him, Rama; <em>āshvāsitā tu</em> = 
consoled, but; <em>vīra patnī</em> = brave one&#39;s, wife; <em>dhvanatā mukhena</em> = sounding, faced 
- with a puling expression; <em>su veṣa [su ] rūpā</em> = properly, attired, fair in aspect; <em>sā 
tārā virarām</em> = she, ṭara, paused - her plaint.</p>

<p class="tat">
Thus consoled by that persuasive, noble-souled and enemy-burner Rama, that brave one&#39;s wife whose aspect 
is fair and whose attire is proper, she paused her plaint, but with a puling expression. [4-24-44]</p>
