"As of now, a little more than a hundred years have slipped by, and I am awaiting events and times minding sage's words in my heart...
[4-63-3]</p>
<p class="comment">There&nbsp; is an inconsistency in accounting the years of Sage Nishākara&#39;s living, dying 
and Sampāti&#39;s continuation on that mountain after sage&#39;s demise. It is said: &#39;for me lapsed are eight 
thousand years, without him...&#39; at 4-60-9 by Sampāti and here he alone is saying that one hundred years are 
elapsed. For this there is another shade given to this verse in other mms and the compound <em>varṣa shatam gatam</em> is replaced with <em>varṣa shata trayam</em> 'years,
hundred, three, three hundred years...' then the meaning will be 'that sage lived for eight
thousand years, and he died a hundred years back, and I have been waiting for three hundred years
after his demise...'</p>

<p class="comment">The auspicious and opportune time in a day is called <em>abhijit lagna</em> a
little later to noon time. This is as said in astrology <em>sūryaḥ ca

||</em> </p>

<p class="comment">The chapters from 59 to 63 are treated as interpolated ones and to support that statement,
the action of Sampāti in flying away without offering further cooperation to monkeys in the search for Seetha, is exemplified. 'As and when he got
wings he flew away like any ordinary bird as it goes as-it-pleases. If Sampāti were to be a true friend of Dasharatha and an admirer of Rama, he
should have at least followed the monkeys up to seashore...' is the argument of those who hold these chapters as interpolated ones. But contradicting
them, the others say, 'Sampāti is given small wings for his locomotive purpose, but not to fly aggressively... further, his part ends as and when he
informs about the direction of Seetha and Ravana, as the role of Swayamprabha ended when she brought the monkeys out of Black Hole... hence these
chapters are not interpolated...' thus the debate continues, endlessly...</p>
