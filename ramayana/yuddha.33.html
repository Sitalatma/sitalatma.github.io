<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">An ogre named Sarama reassures Seetha by telling her that Ravana, the conjurer created an illusory appearance of Rama's head and
exhibited it before her. She informs Seetha that Rama is still alive and is stationed along with his forces at the southern shore of the ocean.
Sarama restores confidence to Seetha, by saying that Rama after killing Ravana in battle will soon win her back.</p>
