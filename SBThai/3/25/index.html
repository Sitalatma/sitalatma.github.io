        <div id="bb25500" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>ātma-prajñaptaye - <span style="color:#990012">อาตฺม-ปฺรชฺญปฺตเย</span></i> indicates that the Lord descends for the benefit of the human race to give transcendental knowledge. Material necessities are quite sufficiently provided for in the Vedic knowledge, which offers a program for good living conditions and gradual elevation to the platform of goodness. In the mode of goodness one’s knowledge expands. On the platform of passion there is no knowledge, for passion is simply an impetus to enjoy material benefits. On the platform of ignorance there is no knowledge and no enjoyment, but simply life almost like that of animals.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25501" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> are meant to elevate one from the mode of ignorance to the platform of goodness. When one is situated in the mode of goodness he is able to understand knowledge of the self, or transcendental knowledge. This knowledge cannot be appreciated by any ordinary man. Therefore, since a disciplic succession is required, this knowledge is expounded either by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself or by His bona fide devotee. Śaunaka Muni also states here that Kapila, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, took birth, or appeared, simply to appreciate and disseminate transcendental knowledge. Simply to understand that one is not matter but spirit soul (<i>ahaṁ brahmāsmi: - <span style="color:#990012">อหํ พฺรหฺมาสฺมิ:</span></i> “I am by nature Brahman”) is not sufficient knowledge for understanding the self and his activities. One must be situated in the activities of Brahman. Knowledge of those activities is explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Such transcendental knowledge can be appreciated in human society but not in animal society, as clearly indicated here by the word <i>nṛṇām, - <span style="color:#990012">นฺฤณามฺ,</span></i> “for the human beings.” Human beings are meant for regulated life. By nature, there is regulation in animal life also, but that is not like the regulative life as described in the scriptures or by the authorities. Human life is regulated life, not animal life. In regulated life only can one understand transcendental knowledge.</p></div>

This is confirmed in the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> also: <i>eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān. - <span style="color:#990012">เอโก พหูนาํ โย วิทธาติ กามานฺ.</span></i> He is the supreme living entity and is supplying the necessities of all other living entities. Thus all other living entities, both <i>viṣṇu-tattva - <span style="color:#990012">วิษฺณุ-ตตฺตฺว</span></i> and <i>jīva-tattva, - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว-ตตฺตฺว,</span></i> are subordinate to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. The same concept is confirmed here. <i>Na hy asya varṣmaṇaḥ puṁsām: - <span style="color:#990012">น หฺยฺ อสฺย วรฺษฺมณฮ ปุํสามฺ:</span></i> amongst the living entities, no one can surpass the Supreme Person because no one is richer, more famous, stronger, more beautiful, wiser or more renounced than He. These qualifications make Him the Supreme Godhead, the cause of all causes. <i>Yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> are very proud of performing wonderful feats, but no one can compare to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25507" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Anyone who is associated with the Supreme Lord is accepted as a first-class <i>yogī. - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี.</span></i> Devotees may not be as powerful as the Supreme Lord, but by constant association with the Lord they become as good as the Lord Himself. Sometimes the devotees act more powerfully than the Lord. Of course, that is the Lord’s concession.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25508" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Also used here is the word <i>varimṇaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">วริมฺณฮ,</span></i> meaning “the most worshipful of all <i>yogīs. - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ.</span></i>” To hear from Kṛṣṇa is the real pleasure of the senses; therefore He is known as Govinda, for by His words, by His teachings, by His instruction — by everything connected with Him — He enlivens the senses. Whatever He instructs is from the transcendental platform, and His instructions, being absolute, are nondifferent from Him. Hearing from Kṛṣṇa or His expansion or plenary expansion like Kapila is very pleasing to the senses. <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> can be read or heard many times, but because it gives great pleasure, the more one reads <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> the more he gets the appetite to read and understand it, and each time he gets new enlightenment. That is the nature of the transcendental message. Similarly, we find that transcendental happiness in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> The more we hear and chant the glories of the Lord, the more we become happy.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25537" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This verse is very instructive, since it indicates the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple. The disciple or conditioned soul is put into this darkest region of ignorance and therefore is entangled in the material existence of sense gratification. It is very difficult to get out of this entanglement and attain freedom, but if one is fortunate enough to get the association of a spiritual master like Kapila Muni or His representative, then by his grace one can be delivered from the mire of ignorance. The spiritual master is therefore worshiped as one who delivers the disciple from the mire of ignorance with the light of the torch of knowledge. The word <i>pāragam - <span style="color:#990012">ปารคมฺ</span></i> is very significant. <i>Pāragam - <span style="color:#990012">ปารคมฺ</span></i> refers to one who can take the disciple to the other side. This side is conditioned life; the other side is the life of freedom. The spiritual master takes the disciple to the other side by opening his eyes with knowledge. We are suffering simply because of ignorance. By the instruction of the spiritual master, the darkness of ignorance is removed, and thus the disciple is enabled to go to the side of freedom. It is stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that after many, many births one surrenders to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if after many, many births one is able to find a bona fide spiritual master and surrender to such a bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa, one can be taken to the side of light.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25547" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The false ego of identifying one’s body as one’s self and of claiming things possessed in relationship with this body is called <i>māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i> In <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> Fifteenth Chapter, the Lord says, “I am sitting in everyone’s heart, and from Me come everyone’s remembrance and forgetfulness.” Devahūti has stated that false identification of the body with the self and attachment for possessions in relation to the body are also under the direction of the Lord. Does this mean that the Lord discriminates by engaging one in His devotional service and another in sense gratification? If that were true, it would be an incongruity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but that is not the actual fact. As soon as the living entity forgets his real, constitutional position of eternal servitorship to the Lord and wants instead to enjoy himself by sense gratification, he is captured by <i>māyā.</i> This capture by <i>māyā</i> is the consciousness of false identification with the body and attachment for the possessions of the body. These are the activities of <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> and since <i>māyā</i> is also an agent of the Lord, it is indirectly the action of the Lord. The Lord is merciful; if anyone wants to forget Him and enjoy this material world, He gives him full facility, not directly but through the agency of His material potency. Therefore, since the material potency is the Lord’s energy, indirectly it is the Lord who gives the facility to forget Him. Devahūti therefore said, “My engagement in sense gratification was also due to You. Now kindly get me free from this entanglement.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25548" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>By the grace of the Lord one is allowed to enjoy this material world, but when one is disgusted with material enjoyment and is frustrated, and when one sincerely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, then the Lord is so kind that He frees one from entanglement. Kṛṣṇa therefore says in <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> “First of all surrender, and then I will take charge of you and free you from all reactions of sinful activities.” Sinful activities are those activities performed in forgetfulness of our relationship with the Lord. In this material world, activities for material enjoyment which are considered to be pious are also sinful. For example, one sometimes gives something in charity to a needy person with a view to getting back the money four times increased. Giving with the purpose of gaining something is called charity in the mode of passion. Everything done here is done in the modes of material nature, and therefore all activities but service to the Lord are sinful. Because of sinful activities we become attracted by the illusion of material attachment, and we think, “I am this body.” I think of the body as myself and of bodily possessions as “mine.” Devahūti requested Lord Kapila to free her from that entanglement of false identification and false possession.</p></div>

The intricacies in the material world of the relationship of the <i>prakṛti</i> and <i>puruṣa, - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ,</span></i> or the enjoyed and the enjoyer, is called <i>saṁsāra, - <span style="color:#990012">สํสาร,</span></i> or material entanglement. Devahūti wanted to cut the tree of material entanglement, and she found the suitable weapon in Kapila Muni. The tree of material existence is explained in the Fifteenth Chapter of <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> as an <i>aśvattha - <span style="color:#990012">อศฺวตฺตฺห</span></i> tree whose root is upwards and whose branches are downwards. It is recommended there that one has to cut the root of this material existential tree with the ax of detachment. What is the attachment? The attachment involves <i>prakṛti</i> and <i>puruṣa.</i> The living entities are trying to lord it over material nature. Since the conditioned soul takes material nature to be the object of his enjoyment and he takes the position of the enjoyer, he is therefore called <i>puruṣa.</i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25554" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Devahūti questioned Kapila Muni, for she knew that only He could cut her attachment to this material world. The living entities, in the guises of men and women, are trying to enjoy the material energy; therefore in one sense everyone is <i>puruṣa - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ</span></i> because <i>puruṣa</i> means “enjoyer” and <i>prakṛti - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤติ</span></i> means “enjoyed.” In this material world both the so-called man and so-called woman are imitating the real <i>puruṣa; - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ</span></i> the Supreme Personality of Godhead is actually the enjoyer in the transcendental sense, whereas all others are <i>prakṛti. - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤติ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤติ.</span></i> The living entities are considered <i>prakṛti.</i> In <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> matter is analyzed as <i>aparā, - <span style="color:#990012">อปรา,</span></i> or inferior nature, whereas beyond this inferior nature there is another, superior nature — the living entities. Living entities are also <i>prakṛti, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรกฺฤติ,</span></i> or enjoyed, but under the spell of <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> the living entities are falsely trying to take the position of enjoyers. That is the cause of <i>saṁsāra-bandha, - <span style="color:#990012">สํสาร-พนฺธ,</span></i> or conditional life. Devahūti wanted to get out of conditional life and place herself in full surrender. The Lord is <i>śaraṇya, - <span style="color:#990012">ศรณฺย,</span></i> which means “the only worthy personality to whom one can fully surrender,” because He is full of all opulences. If anyone actually wants relief, the best course is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is also described here as <i>sad-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">สทฺ-ธรฺม</span>-vidāṁ variṣṭham. - <span style="color:#990012">สทฺ-ธรฺม-วิทาํ วริษฺฐมฺ.</span></i> This indicates that of all transcendental occupations the best occupation is eternal loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <i>Dharma - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม</span></i> is sometimes translated as “religion,” but that is not exactly the meaning. <i>Dharma</i> actually means “that which one cannot give up, that which is inseparable from oneself.” The warmth of fire is inseparable from fire; therefore warmth is called the <i>dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม,</span></i> or nature, of fire. Similarly, <i>sad-dharma</i> means “eternal occupation.” That eternal occupation is engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The purpose of Kapiladeva’s Sāṅkhya philosophy is to propagate pure, uncontaminated devotional service, and therefore He is addressed here as the most important personality amongst those who know the transcendental occupation of the living entity.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25559" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Devahūti has surrendered her confession of material entanglement and her desire to gain release. Her questions to Lord Kapila are very interesting for persons who are actually trying to get liberation from material entanglement and attain the perfectional stage of human life. Unless one is interested in understanding his spiritual life, or his constitutional position, and unless he also feels inconvenience in material existence, his human form of life is spoiled. One who does not care for these transcendental necessities of life and simply engages like an animal in eating, sleeping, fearing and mating has spoiled his life. Lord Kapila was very much satisfied by His mother’s questions because the answers stimulate one’s desire for liberation from the conditional life of material existence. Such questions are called <i>apavarga-vardhanam. - <span style="color:#990012">อปวรฺค-วรฺธนมฺ.</span></i> Those who have actual spiritual interest are called <i>sat, - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ,</span></i> or devotees. <i>Sat - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ</span>āṁ prasaṅgāt. - <span style="color:#990012">สตาํ ปฺรสงฺคาตฺ.</span></i> <i>Sat</i> means “that which eternally exists,” and <i>asat - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ</span></i> means “that which is not eternal.” Unless one is situated on the spiritual platform, he is not <i>sat; - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ</span></i> he is <i>asat. - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ.</span></i> The <i>asat</i> stands on a platform which will not exist, but anyone who stands on the spiritual platform will exist eternally. As spirit soul, everyone exists eternally, but the <i>asat</i> has accepted the material world as his shelter, and therefore he is full of anxiety. <i>Asad-grāhān, - <span style="color:#990012">อสทฺ-คฺราหานฺ,</span></i> the incompatible situation of the spirit soul who has the false idea of enjoying matter, is the cause of the soul’s being <i>asat.</i> Actually, the spirit soul is not <i>asat.</i> As soon as one is conscious of this fact and takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he becomes <i>sat.</i> <i>Satāṁ gatiḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">สตาํ คติฮ,</span></i> the path of the eternal, is very interesting to persons who are after liberation, and His Lordship Kapila began to speak about that path.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25564" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the material world, everyone is trying to get some material happiness, but as soon as we get some material happiness, there is also material distress. In the material world one cannot have unadulterated happiness. Any kind of happiness one has is contaminated by distress also. For example, if we want to drink milk then we have to bother to maintain a cow and keep her fit to supply milk. Drinking milk is very nice; it is also pleasure. But for the sake of drinking milk one has to accept so much trouble. The <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> system, as here stated by the Lord, is meant to end all material happiness and material distress. The best <i>yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">โยค,</span></i> as taught in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> by Kṛṣṇa, is <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> It is also mentioned in the <i>Gītā - <span style="color:#990012">คีตา</span></i> that one should try to be tolerant and not be disturbed by material happiness or distress. Of course, one may say that he is not disturbed by material happiness, but he does not know that just after one enjoys so-called material happiness, material distress will follow. This is the law of the material world. Lord Kapila states that the <i>yoga</i> system is the science of the spirit. One practices <i>yoga</i> in order to attain perfection on the spiritual platform. There is no question of material happiness or distress. It is transcendental. Lord Kapila will eventually explain how it is transcendental, but the preliminary introduction is given here.</p></div>

When one becomes free from this contamination, then his mind and consciousness also become freed and attain their original state. Mind, consciousness and the living entity exist.

One’s senses must be engaged in devotional service to the Lord. That is the process. The mind must have some engagement. One cannot make the mind vacant. Of course there are some foolish attempts to try to make the mind vacant or void, but that is not possible. The only process that will purify the mind is to engage it in Kṛṣṇa. The mind must be engaged. If we engage our mind in Kṛṣṇa, naturally the consciousness becomes fully purified, and there is no chance of the entrance of material desire and greed.</p></div>

Just as the sun’s rays are minute particles of the brilliant constitution of the sun, so a living entity is a minute particle of the Supreme Spirit. The individual soul and the Supreme Lord are not separated as in material differentiation. The individual soul is a particle from the very beginning. One should not think that because the individual soul is a particle, it is fragmented from the whole spirit. Māyāvāda philosophy enunciates that the whole spirit exists, but a part of it, which is called the <i>jīva,</i> is entrapped by illusion. This philosophy, however, is unacceptable because spirit cannot be divided like a fragment of matter. That part, the <i>jīva,</i> is eternally a part. As long as the Supreme Spirit exists, His part and parcel also exists. As long as the sun exists, the molecules of the sun’s rays also exist.</p></div>

It is therefore infinitesimal. The Supreme Spirit is infinite, but the living entity, or the individual soul, is infinitesimal, although it is not different in quality from the Supreme Spirit. Two words in this verse are to be particularly noted. One is <i>nirantaram, - <span style="color:#990012">นิรนฺตรมฺ,</span></i> which means “nondifferent,” or “of the same quality.” The individual soul is also expressed here as <i>aṇimānam. - <span style="color:#990012">อณิมานมฺ.</span></i> <i>Aṇimānam - <span style="color:#990012">อณิมานมฺ</span></i> means “infinitesimal.” The Supreme Spirit is all-pervading, but the very small spirit is the individual soul. <i>Akhaṇḍitam - <span style="color:#990012">อขณฺฑิตมฺ</span></i> means not exactly “fragmented” but “constitutionally always infinitesimal.” No one can separate the molecular parts of the sunshine from the sun, but at the same time the molecular part of the sunshine is not as expansive as the sun itself. Similarly, the living entity, by his constitutional position, is qualitatively the same as the Supreme Spirit, but he is infinitesimal.</p></div>

Self-realization is the position of the liberated state. One understands his constitutional position by knowledge and <i>vairāgya, - <span style="color:#990012">ไวราคฺย,</span></i> renunciation. Without knowledge, one cannot have realization. The realization that one is the infinitesimal part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit makes him unattached to material, conditional life. That is the beginning of devotional service. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, one cannot engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord. In this verse, it is therefore stated, <i>jñāna-vairāgya-yuktena: - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-ไวราคฺย-ยุเกฺตน:</span></i> when one is in full knowledge of one’s constitutional position and is in the renounced order of life, detached from material attraction, then, by pure devotional service, <i>bhakti-yuktena, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-ยุเกฺตน,</span></i> he can engage himself as a loving servant of the Lord. <i>Paripaśyati - <span style="color:#990012">ปริปศฺยติ</span></i> means that he can see everything in its right perspective.

Similarly, it is confirmed in the <i>Nārada-pañcarātra - <span style="color:#990012">นารท-ปญฺจราตฺร</span></i> that when the senses are purified they can then be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.

Devotional service is to be offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul of everything, for that is the only reliable path of self-realization, or Brahman realization. The word <i>brahma-siddhaye - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สิทฺธเย</span></i> means to understand oneself to be different from matter, to understand oneself to be Brahman.

        <div id="bb25597" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the beginning of the Second Chapter of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> it is stated that when one engages himself in the devotional service of Vāsudeva, spiritual knowledge and renunciation of the material world automatically become manifest. Thus a devotee does not have to try separately for renunciation or knowledge. Devotional service itself is so powerful that by one’s service attitude, everything is revealed. It is stated here, <i>śivaḥ panthāḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ศิวฮ ปนฺตฺหาฮ:</span></i> this is the only auspicious path for self-realization. The path of devotional service is the most confidential means for attaining Brahman realization.

In the <i>Upaniṣads - <span style="color:#990012">อุปนิษทฺสฺ</span></i> a devotee prays to the Lord to kindly put aside the effulgence, <i>brahmajyoti, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ,</span></i> so that the devotee may see within the <i>brahmajyoti</i> the actual, eternal form of the Lord.

The understanding of the effulgent rays of the body of the Supreme Godhead is not the perfect stage of <i>brahma-siddhi, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สิทฺธิ,</span></i> or Brahman realization. Nor is the realization of the Paramātmā feature of the Supreme Person perfect, for Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is <i>akhilātmā - <span style="color:#990012">อขิลาตฺมา</span></i> — He is the Supersoul. One who realizes the Supreme Personality realizes the other features, namely the Paramātmā feature and the Brahman feature, and that total realization is <i>brahma-siddhi.</i></p></div>

        <div id="bb25602" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Here it is clearly stated that attachment for one thing is the cause of bondage in conditioned life, and the same attachment, when applied to something else, opens the door of liberation. Attachment cannot be killed; it has simply to be transferred. Attachment for material things is called material consciousness, and attachment for Kṛṣṇa or His devotee is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Consciousness is therefore the platform of attachment. It is clearly stated here that when we simply purify the consciousness from material consciousness to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we attain liberation. Despite the statement that one should give up attachment, desirelessness is not possible for a living entity. A living entity, by constitution, has the propensity to be attached to something. We see that if someone has no object of attachment, if he has no children, then he transfers his attachment to cats and dogs. This indicates that the propensity for attachment cannot be stopped; it must be utilized for the best purpose. Our attachment for material things perpetuates our conditional state, but the same attachment, when transferred to the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, is the source of liberation.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25603" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Here it is recommended that attachment should be transferred to the self-realized devotees, the <i>sādhu - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span>s. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุสฺ.</span></i> And who is a <i>sādhu</i>? A <i>sādhu</i> is not just an ordinary man with a saffron robe or long beard. A <i>sādhu</i> is described in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> as one who unflinchingly engages in devotional service. Even though one is found not to be following the strict rules and regulations of devotional service, if one simply has unflinching faith in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, he is understood to be a <i>sādhu. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ.</span></i> <i>Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุรฺ เอว ส มนฺตวฺยฮ.</span></i> A <i>sādhu</i> is a strict follower of devotional service. It is recommended here that if one at all wants to realize Brahman, or spiritual perfection, his attachment should be transferred to the <i>sādhu, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ,</span></i> or devotee. Lord Caitanya also confirmed this. <i>Lava-mātra sādhu-saṅge sarva-siddhi haya: - <span style="color:#990012">ลว-มาตฺร สาธุ-สเงฺค สรฺว-สิทฺธิ หย:</span></i> simply by a moment’s association with a <i>sādhu,</i> one can attain perfection.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25604" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p><i>Mahātmā - <span style="color:#990012">มหาตฺมา</span></i> is a synonym of <i>sādhu - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ.</span></i> It is said that service to a <i>mahātmā, - <span style="color:#990012">มหาตฺมา,</span></i> or elevated devotee of the Lord, is <i>dvāram āhur vimukteḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ทฺวารมฺ อาหุรฺ วิมเุกฺตฮ,</span></i> the royal road of liberation. <i>Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam - <span style="color:#990012">มหตฺ-เสวาํ ทฺวารมฺ อาหุรฺ วิมเุกฺตสฺ ตโม-ทฺวารํ โยษิตาํ สงฺคิ-สงฺคมฺ</span></i> (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 5.5.2). Rendering service to the materialists has the opposite effect. If anyone offers service to a gross materialist, or a person engaged only in sense enjoyment, then by association with such a person the door to hell is opened. The same principle is confirmed here. Attachment to a devotee is attachment to the service of the Lord because if one associates with a <i>sādhu, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ,</span></i> the result will be that the <i>sādhu</i> will teach him how to become a devotee, a worshiper and a sincere servitor of the Lord. These are the gifts of a <i>sādhu. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ.</span></i> If we want to associate with a <i>sādhu,</i> we cannot expect him to give us instructions on how to improve our material condition, but he will give us instructions on how to cut the knot of the contamination of material attraction and how to elevate ourselves in devotional service. That is the result of associating with a <i>sādhu.</i> Kapila Muni first of all instructs that the path of liberation begins with such association.</p></div>

His concern therefore is to enlighten people in devotional service to the Lord. That is his mercy. He knows that without devotional service to the Lord, human life is spoiled. A devotee travels all over the country, from door to door, preaching “Be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Be a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Don’t spoil your life in simply fulfilling your animal propensities. Human life is meant for self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” These are the preachings of a <i>sādhu. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ.</span></i> He is not satisfied with his own liberation. He always thinks about others. He is the most compassionate personality towards all the fallen souls. Therefore one of his qualifications is <i>kāruṇika, - <span style="color:#990012">การุณิก,</span></i> great mercy to the fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work, he has to meet with so many opposing elements, and therefore the <i>sādhu, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ,</span></i> or devotee of the Lord, has to be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him because the conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. They do not like it; that is their disease. The <i>sādhu</i> has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance of devotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, Haridāsa Ṭhākura was caned in twenty-two marketplaces, and Lord Caitanya’s principal assistant, Nityānanda, was violently attacked by Jagāi and Mādhāi. But still they were tolerant because their mission was to deliver the fallen souls. One of the qualifications of a <i>sādhu</i> is that he is very tolerant and is merciful to all fallen souls. He is merciful because he is the well-wisher of all living entities. He is not only a well-wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. It is said here, <i>sarva-dehinām, - <span style="color:#990012">สรฺว-เทหินามฺ,</span></i> which indicates all living entities who have accepted material bodies. Not only does the human being have a material body, but other living entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material bodies. The devotee of the Lord is merciful to everyone — the cats, dogs, trees, etc. He treats all living entities in such a way that they can ultimately get salvation from this material entanglement. Śivānanda Sena, one of the disciples of Lord Caitanya, gave liberation to a dog by treating the dog transcendentally. There are many instances where a dog got salvation by association with a <i>sādhu,</i> because a <i>sādhu</i> engages in the highest philanthropic activities for the benediction of all living entities. Yet although a <i>sādhu</i> is not inimical towards anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even a <i>sādhu</i> has many enemies.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25610" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>What is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference in behavior. A <i>sādhu - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span></i> behaves with all conditioned souls for their ultimate relief from material entanglement. Therefore no one can be more friendly than a <i>sādhu</i> in relieving a conditioned soul. A <i>sādhu</i> is calm, and he quietly and peacefully follows the principles of scripture. A <i>sādhu</i> means one who follows the principles of scripture and at the same time is a devotee of the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture must be a devotee of God because all the <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> instruct us to obey the orders of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore <i>sādhu</i> means a follower of the scriptural injunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these characteristics are prominent in a devotee. A devotee develops all the good qualities of the demigods, whereas a nondevotee, even though academically qualified, has no actual good qualifications or good characteristics according to the standard of transcendental realization.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25625" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kapila Muni herein advises His mother, Devahūti, that if she wants to be free from material attachment, she should increase her attachment for the <i>sādhus, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุสฺ,</span></i> or devotees who are completely freed from all material attachment. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> Fifteenth Chapter, verse 5, it is stated who is qualified to enter into the kingdom of Godhead. It is said there, <i>nirmāna-mohā jita-saṅga-doṣāḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺมาน-โมหา ชิต-สงฺค-โทษาฮ.</span></i> This refers to one who is completely freed from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness. A person may be materially very rich, opulent or respectable, but if he at all wants to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, back home, back to Godhead, then he has to be freed from the puffed-up condition of material possessiveness, because that is a false position.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25626" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>moha - <span style="color:#990012">โมห</span></i> used here means the false understanding that one is rich or poor. In this material world, the conception that one is very rich or very poor — or any such consciousness in connection with material existence — is false, because this body itself is false, or temporary. A pure soul who is prepared to be freed from this material entanglement must first of all be free from the association of the three modes of nature. Our consciousness at the present moment is polluted because of association with the three modes of nature; therefore in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> the same principle is stated. It is advised, <i>jita-saṅga-doṣāḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ชิต-สงฺค-โทษาฮ:</span></i> one should be freed from the contaminated association of the three modes of material nature. Here also, in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> this is confirmed: a pure devotee, who is preparing to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, is also freed from the association of the three modes of material nature. We have to seek the association of such devotees. For this reason we have begun the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. There are many mercantile, scientific and other associations in human society to develop a particular type of education or consciousness, but there is no association which helps one to get free from all material association. If anyone has reached the stage where he must become free from this material contamination, then he has to seek the association of devotees, wherein Kṛṣṇa consciousness is exclusively cultured. One can thereby become freed from all material association.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25627" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Because a devotee is freed from all contaminated material association, he is not affected by the miseries of material existence. Even though he appears to be in the material world, he is not affected by the miseries of the material world. How is it possible? There is a very good example in the activities of the cat. The cat carries her kittens in her mouth, and when she kills a rat she also carries the booty in her mouth. Thus both are carried in the mouth of the cat, but they are in different conditions. The kitten feels comfort in the mouth of the mother, whereas when the rat is carried in the mouth of the cat, the rat feels the blows of death. Similarly, those who are <i>sādhavaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธวฮ,</span></i> or devotees engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the transcendental service of the Lord, do not feel the contamination of material miseries, whereas those who are not devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness actually feel the miseries of material existence. One should therefore give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of persons engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and by such association he will benefit in spiritual advancement. By their words and instructions, he will be able to cut off his attachment to material existence.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25632" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The process of advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service is described here. The first point is that one must seek the association of persons who are Kṛṣṇa conscious and who engage in devotional service. Without such association one cannot make advancement. Simply by theoretical knowledge or study one cannot make any appreciable advancement. One must give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of devotees because without the association of devotees one cannot understand the activities of the Lord. Generally, people are convinced of the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. Because they do not associate with devotees, they cannot understand that the Absolute Truth can be a person and have personal activities. This is a very difficult subject matter, and unless one has personal understanding of the Absolute Truth, there is no meaning to devotion. Service or devotion cannot be offered to anything impersonal. Service must be offered to a person. Nondevotees cannot appreciate Kṛṣṇa consciousness by reading the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> or any other Vedic literature wherein the activities of the Lord are described; they think that these activities are fictional, manufactured stories because spiritual life is not explained to them in the proper mood. To understand the personal activities of the Lord, one has to seek the association of devotees, and by such association, when one contemplates and tries to understand the transcendental activities of the Lord, the path to liberation is open, and he is freed. One who has firm faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes fixed, and his attraction for association with the Lord and the devotees increases. Association with devotees means association with the Lord. The devotee who makes this association develops the consciousness for rendering service to the Lord, and then, being situated in the transcendental position of devotional service, he gradually becomes perfect.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25637" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In all scriptures people are encouraged to act in a pious way so that they can enjoy sense gratification not only in this life but also in the next. For example, one is promised promotion to the heavenly kingdom of higher planets by pious fruitive activities. But a devotee in the association of devotees prefers to contemplate the activities of the Lord — how He has created this universe, how He is maintaining it, how the creation dissolves, and how in the spiritual kingdom the Lord’s pastimes are going on. There are full literatures describing these activities of the Lord, especially <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> <i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span></i> and <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> The sincere devotee who associates with devotees gets the opportunity to hear and contemplate this subject of the pastimes of the Lord, and the result is that he feels distaste for so-called happiness in this or that world, in heaven or on other planets. The devotees are simply interested in being transferred to the personal association of the Lord; they have no more attraction for temporary so-called happiness. That is the position of one who is <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span>-yukta. - <span style="color:#990012">โยค-ยุกฺต.</span></i> One who is fixed in mystic power is not disturbed by the allurement of this world or that world; he is interested in the matters of spiritual understanding or the spiritual situation. This sublime situation is very easily attained by the easiest process, <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> <i>Ṛjubhir yoga-mārgaiḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ฤชุภิรฺ โยค-มาไรฺคฮ.</span></i> A very suitable word used here is <i>ṛjubhiḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ฤชุภิฮ,</span></i> or “very easy.” There are different processes of <i>yoga-mārga, - <span style="color:#990012">โยค-มารฺค,</span></i> attaining <i>yoga</i> perfection, but this process, devotional service to the Lord, is the easiest. Not only is it the easiest process, but the result is sublime. Everyone should therefore try to take this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and reach the highest perfection of life.</p></div>

Unless one has good engagements in spiritual service, it is not possible to get out of the attachment to material service. Those who are not devotees, therefore, are interested in so-called humanitarian or philanthropic work, such as opening a hospital or charitable institution. These are undoubtedly good works in the sense that they are pious activities, and their result is that the performer may get some opportunities for sense gratification, either in this life or in the next. Devotional service, however, is beyond the boundary of sense gratification. It is completely spiritual activity. When one engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service, naturally he does not get any opportunity to engage in sense gratificatory activities. Kṛṣṇa conscious activities are performed not blindly but with perfect understanding of knowledge and renunciation. This kind of <i>yoga</i> practice, in which the mind is always fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotion, results in liberation in this very life. The person who performs such acts gets in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya therefore approved the process of hearing from realized devotees about the pastimes of the Lord. It does not matter to what category of this world the audience belongs. If one meekly and submissively hears about the activities of the Lord from a realized soul, he will be able to conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unconquerable by any other process. Hearing or associating with devotees is the most important function for self-realization.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25652" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are different kinds of mystic <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> systems aiming for different phases of the Absolute Truth. The <i>jñāna-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-โยค</span></i> system aims at the impersonal Brahman effulgence, and the <i>haṭha-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">หฐ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">หฐ-โยค</span></i> system aims at the localized personal aspect, the Paramātmā feature of the Absolute Truth, whereas <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> or devotional service, which is executed in nine different ways, headed by hearing and chanting, aims at complete realization of the Supreme Lord. There are different methods of self-realization. But here Devahūti especially refers to the <i>bhakti-yoga</i> system, which has already been primarily explained by the Lord. The different parts of the <i>bhakti-yoga</i> system are hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping the Lord in the temple, accepting service to Him, carrying out His orders, making friendship with Him and ultimately surrendering everything for the service of the Lord. The word <i>nirvāṇātman - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺวาณาตฺมนฺ</span></i> is very significant in this verse. Unless one accepts the process of devotional service, one cannot end the continuation of material existence. As far as <i>jñānīs - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญานีสฺ</span></i> are concerned, they are interested in <i>jñāna-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน-โยค,</span></i> but even if one elevates oneself, after a great performance of austerity, to the Brahman effulgence, there is a chance of falling down again to the material world. Therefore <i>jñāna-yoga</i> does not actually end material existence. Similarly, regarding the <i>haṭha-yoga</i> system, which aims at the localized aspect of the Lord, Paramātmā, it has been experienced that many <i>yogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ,</span></i> such as Viśvāmitra, fall down. But <i>bhakti-yogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยคีสฺ,</span></i> once approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never come back to this material world, as it is confirmed in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā. - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา.</span></i> <i>Yad gatvā na nivartante: - <span style="color:#990012">ยทฺ คตฺวา น นิวรฺตเนฺต:</span></i> upon going, one never comes back. <i>Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti: - <span style="color:#990012">ตฺยกฺตฺวา เทหํ ปุนรฺ ชนฺม ไนติ:</span></i> after giving up this body, he never comes back again to accept a material body. <i>Nirvāṇa - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺวาณ</span></i> does not finish the existence of the soul. The soul is ever existing. Therefore <i>nirvāṇa - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺวาณ</span></i> means to end one’s material existence, and to end material existence means to go back home, back to Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25653" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Sometimes it is asked how the living entity falls down from the spiritual world to the material world. Here is the answer. Unless one is elevated to the Vaikuṇṭha planets, directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is prone to fall down, either from the impersonal Brahman realization or from an ecstatic trance of meditation. Another word in this verse, <i>bhagavad-bāṇaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">พาณฮ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-พาณฮ,</span></i> is very significant. <i>Bāṇaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">พาณฮ</span></i> means “arrow.” The <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> system is just like an arrow aiming up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The <i>bhakti-yoga</i> system never urges one towards the impersonal Brahman effulgence or to the point of Paramātmā realization. This <i>bāṇaḥ,</i> or arrow, is so sharp and swift that it goes directly to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, penetrating the regions of impersonal Brahman and localized Paramātmā.</p></div>

Our senses are also controlled by different demigods; our senses are representations of various demigods, and the mind is the representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The senses, led by the mind, act under the influence of the demigods. When the service is ultimately aimed at the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the senses are in their natural position. The Lord is called Hṛṣīkeśa, for He is actually the proprietor and ultimate master of the senses. The senses and the mind are naturally inclined to work, but when they are materially contaminated they work for some material benefit or for the service of the demigods, although actually they are meant to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The senses are called <i>hṛṣīka, - <span style="color:#990012">หฺฤษีก,</span></i> and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called Hṛṣīkeśa. Indirectly, all the senses are naturally inclined to serve the Supreme Lord. That is called <i>bhakti. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ.</span></i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25669" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kapiladeva said that when the senses, without desire for material profit or other selfish motives, are engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is situated in devotional service.

Thus <i>bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> is the stage after liberation. Unless one is liberated one cannot engage the senses in the service of the Lord. When the senses are engaged either in material activities of sense gratification or in the activities of the Vedic injunctions, there is some motive, but when the same senses are engaged in the service of the Lord and there is no motive, that is called <i>animittā - <span style="color:#990012">อนิมิตฺตา</span></i> and is the natural inclination of the mind. The conclusion is that when the mind, without being deviated either by Vedic injunctions or by material activities, is fully engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is far better than the most aspired-for liberation from material entanglement.</p></div>

The example is given here that the fire in the stomach can digest whatever we eat. If the digestive power is sufficient, then whatever we can eat will be digested by the fire in the stomach. Similarly, a devotee does not have to try separately to attain liberation. That very service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of his liberation because to engage oneself in the service of the Lord is to liberate oneself from material entanglement. Śrī Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura explained this position very nicely. He said, “If I have unflinching devotion unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, then <i>mukti, - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ,</span></i> or liberation, serves me as my maidservant. <i>Mukti, - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ,</span></i> the maidservant, is always ready to do whatever I ask.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25675" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>For a devotee, liberation is no problem at all. Liberation takes place without separate endeavor. <i>Bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> is therefore far better than <i>mukti, - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ,</span></i> or the impersonalist position. The impersonalists undergo severe penances and austerities to attain <i>mukti,</i> but the <i>bhakta, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺต,</span></i> simply by engaging himself in the <i>bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> process, especially in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, immediately develops control over the tongue by engaging it in chanting and by accepting the remnants of foodstuff offered to the Personality of Godhead. As soon as the tongue is controlled, naturally all other senses are controlled automatically. Sense control is the perfection of the <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> principle, and one’s liberation begins immediately as soon as he engages himself in the service of the Lord.

        <div id="bb25680" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are five kinds of liberation stated in the scriptures. One is to become one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or to forsake one’s individuality and merge into the Supreme Spirit. This is called <i>ekātmatām. - <span style="color:#990012">เอกาตฺมตามฺ.</span></i> A devotee never accepts this kind of liberation. The other four liberations are: to be promoted to the same planet as God (Vaikuṇṭha), to associate personally with the Supreme Lord, to achieve the same opulence as the Lord and to attain the same bodily features as the Supreme Lord. A pure devotee, as will be explained by Kapila Muni, does not aspire for any of the five liberations. He especially despises as hellish the idea of becoming one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, said, <i>kaivalyaṁ narakāyate: - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺยํ นรกายเต:</span></i> “The happiness of becoming one with the Supreme Lord, which is aspired for by the Māyāvādīs, is considered hellish.” That oneness is not for pure devotees.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25681" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are many so-called devotees who think that in the conditioned state we may worship the Personality of Godhead but that ultimately there is no personality. They say that since the Absolute Truth is impersonal, one can imagine a personal form of the impersonal Absolute Truth for the time being, but as soon as one becomes liberated the worship stops. That is the theory put forward by the Māyāvāda philosophy. Actually the impersonalists do not merge into the existence of the Supreme Person but into His personal bodily luster, which is called the <i>brahmajyoti - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ.</span></i> Although that <i>brahmajyoti</i> is not different from His personal body, that sort of oneness (merging into the bodily luster of the Personality of Godhead) is not accepted by a pure devotee because the devotees engage in greater pleasure than the so-called pleasure of merging into His existence. The greatest pleasure is to serve the Lord. Devotees are always thinking about how to serve Him; they are always designing ways and means to serve the Supreme Lord, even in the midst of the greatest obstacles of material existence.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25682" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Māyāvādīs accept the description of the pastimes of the Lord as stories, but actually they are not stories; they are historical facts. Pure devotees accept the narrations of the pastimes of the Lord not as stories but as Absolute Truth. The words <i>mama pauruṣāṇi - <span style="color:#990012">มม ปะอุรุษาณิ</span></i> are significant. Devotees are very much attached to glorifying the activities of the Lord, whereas the Māyāvādīs cannot even think of these activities. According to them the Absolute Truth is impersonal. Without personal existence, how can there be activity? The impersonalists take the activities mentioned in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ, ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> and other Vedic literatures as fictitious stories, and therefore they interpret them most mischievously. The have no idea of the Personality of Godhead. They unnecessarily poke their noses into the scripture and interpret it in a deceptive way in order to mislead the innocent public. The activities of Māyāvāda philosophy are very dangerous to the public, and therefore Lord Caitanya warned us never to hear from any Māyāvādī about any scripture. They will spoil the entire process, and the person hearing them will never be able to come to the path of devotional service to attain the highest perfection, or will be able to do so only after a very long time.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25683" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is clearly stated by Kapila Muni that <i>bhakti - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ</span></i> activities, or activities in devotional service, are transcendental to <i>mukti - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ.</span></i> This is called <i>pañcama-puruṣārtha. - <span style="color:#990012">ปญฺจม-ปุรุษารฺตฺห.</span></i> Generally, people engage in the activities of religion, economic development and sense gratification, and ultimately they work with an idea that they are going to become one with the Supreme Lord (<i>mukti</i>). But <i>bhakti</i> is transcendental to all these activities. The <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> therefore begins by stating that all kinds of pretentious religiosity is completely eradicated from the <i>Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> Ritualistic activities for economic development and sense gratification and, after frustration in sense gratification, the desire to become one with the Supreme Lord, are all completely rejected in the <i>Bhāgavatam.</i> The <i>Bhāgavatam</i> is especially meant for the pure devotees, who always engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the activities of the Lord, and always glorify these transcendental activities. Pure devotees worship the transcendental activities of the Lord in Vṛndāvana, Dvārakā and Mathurā as they are narrated in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> and other <i>Purāṇas. - <span style="color:#990012">ปุราณสฺ.</span></i> The Māyāvādī philosophers completely reject them as stories, but actually they are great and worshipable subject matters and thus are relishable only for devotees. That is the difference between a Māyāvādī and a pure devotee.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25688" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Māyāvādīs and atheists accept the forms of the Deities in the temple of the Lord as idols, but devotees do not worship idols. They directly worship the Personality of Godhead in His <i>arcā - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span></i> incarnation. <i>Arcā - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span></i> refers to the form which we can worship in our present condition. Actually, in our present state it is not possible to see God in His spiritual form because our material eyes and senses cannot conceive of a spiritual form. We cannot even see the spiritual form of the individual soul. When a man dies we cannot see how the spiritual form leaves the body. That is the defect of our material senses. In order to be seen by our material senses, the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts a favorable form, which is called <i>arcā-vigraha. - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา-วิคฺรห.</span></i> This <i>arcā-vigraha, - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา-วิคฺรห,</span></i> sometimes called the <i>arcā</i> incarnation, is not different from Him. Just as the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepts various incarnations, He takes on forms made out of matter — clay, wood, metal and jewels.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25689" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are many śāstric injunctions which give instructions for carving forms of the Lord. These forms are not material. If God is all-pervading, then He is also in the material elements. There is no doubt about it. But the atheists think otherwise. Although they preach that everything is God, when they go to the temple and see the form of the Lord, they deny that He is God. According to their own theory, everything is God. Then why is the Deity not God? Actually, they have no conception of God. The devotees’ vision, however, is different; their vision is smeared with love of God. As soon as they see the Lord in His different forms, the devotees become saturated with love, for they do not find any difference between the Lord and His form in the temple, as do the atheists. The smiling face of the Deity in the temple is beheld by the devotees as transcendental and spiritual, and the decoration of the body of the Lord is very much appreciated by the devotees. It is the duty of the spiritual master to teach how to decorate the Deity in the temple, how to cleanse the temple and how to worship the Deity. There are different procedures and rules and regulations which are followed in temples of Viṣṇu, and devotees go there and see the Deity, the <i>vigraha, - <span style="color:#990012">วิคฺรห,</span></i> and spiritually enjoy the form because all of the Deities are benevolent. The devotees express their minds before the Deity, and in many instances the Deity also gives answers. But one must be a very elevated devotee in order to be able to speak with the Supreme Lord. Sometimes the Lord informs the devotee through dreams. These exchanges of feelings between the Deity and the devotee are not understandable by atheists, but actually the devotee enjoys them. Kapila Muni is explaining how the devotees see the decorated body and face of the Deity and how they speak with Him in devotional service.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25694" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are three divisions of devotees: first class, second class and third class. Even the third-class devotees are liberated souls. It is explained in this verse that although they do not have knowledge, simply by seeing the beautiful decoration of the Deity in the temple, the devotees become absorbed in thought of Him and lose all other consciousness. Simply by fixing oneself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaging the senses in the service of the Lord, one is imperceptibly liberated. This is also confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา.</span></i> Simply by discharging uncontaminated devotional service as prescribed in the scriptures, one becomes equal to Brahman. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> it is said, <i>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-ภูยาย กลฺปเต</span></i> This means that the living entity in his original state is Brahman because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman.

Even the third-class devotee — who is not advanced in knowledge of the Absolute Truth but simply offers obeisances with great devotion, thinks of the Lord, sees the Lord in the temple and brings forth flowers and fruits to offer to the Deity — becomes imperceptibly liberated. <i>Śraddhayānvitāḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรทฺธยานฺวิตาฮ:</span></i> with great devotion the devotees offer worshipful respects and paraphernalia to the Deity. The Deities of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, Lakṣmī and Nārāyaṇa, and Rāma and Sītā are very attractive to devotees, so much so that when they see the statue decorated in the temple of the Lord they become fully absorbed in thought of the Lord. That is the state of liberation. In other words, it is confirmed herewith that even a third-class devotee is in the transcendental position, above those who are trying for liberation by speculation or by other methods. Even great impersonalists like Śukadeva Gosvāmī and the four Kumāras were attracted by the beauty of the Deities in the temple, by the decorations and by the aroma of <i>tulasī - <span style="color:#990012">ตุลสี</span></i> offered to the Lord, and they became devotees.

It is a prescribed duty in temple worship that not only should one visit the temple to see the Deity nicely decorated, but at the same time he should hear the recitation of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span>, Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ, ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> or some similar literature, which is regularly recited in the temple. It is the system in Vṛndāvana that in every temple there is recitation of the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> Even third-class devotees who have no literary knowledge or no time to read <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> or <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> get the opportunity to hear about the pastimes of the Lord. In this way their minds may remain always absorbed in the thought of the Lord — His form, His activities and His transcendental nature. This state of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a liberated stage. Lord Caitanya therefore recommended five important processes in the discharge of devotional service: (1) to chant the holy names of the Lord, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, (2) to associate with devotees and serve them as far as possible, (3) to hear <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> (4) to see the decorated temple and the Deity and, if possible, (5) to live in a place like Vṛndāvana or Mathurā. These five items alone can help a devotee achieve the highest perfectional stage. This is confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> and here in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> That third-class devotees can also imperceptibly achieve liberation is accepted in all Vedic literatures.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25701" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The <i>vibhūti, - <span style="color:#990012">วิภูติ,</span></i> or opulences, offered by <i>māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i> are of many varieties. We have experience of different varieties of material enjoyment even on this planet, but if one is able to promote himself to higher planets like Candraloka, the sun or, still higher, Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, or even ultimately the highest planet, which is inhabited by Brahmā and is called Satyaloka, there are immense possibilities for material enjoyment. For example, the duration of life on higher planets is far, far greater than on this planet. It is said that on the moon the duration of life is such that our six months are equal to one day. We cannot even imagine the duration of life on the highest planet. It is stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that Brahmā’s twelve hours are inconceivable even to our mathematicians. These are all descriptions of the external energy of the Lord, or <i>māyā. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i> Besides these, there are other opulences which the <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> can achieve by their mystic power. They are also material. A devotee does not aspire for all these material pleasures, although they are available to him simply by wishing. By the grace of the Lord, a devotee can achieve wonderful success simply by willing, but a real devotee does not like that. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught that one should not desire material opulence or material reputation, nor should one try to enjoy material beauty; one should simply aspire to be absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord, even if one does not get liberation but has to continue the process of birth and death unlimitedly. Actually, however, to one who engages in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, liberation is already guaranteed. Devotees enjoy all the benefits of the higher planets and the Vaikuṇṭha planets also. It is especially mentioned here, <i>bhāgavatīṁ bhadrām. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตีํ ภทฺรามฺ.</span></i> In the Vaikuṇṭha planets everything is eternally peaceful, yet a pure devotee does not even aspire to be promoted there. But still he gets that advantage; he enjoys all the facilities of the material and spiritual worlds, even during the present life span.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25706" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that one may elevate himself to the higher planetary systems, even up to Brahmaloka, by dint of pious activities, but when the effects of such pious activities are finished, one again comes back to this earth to begin a new life of activities. Thus even though one is promoted to the higher planetary system for enjoyment and a long duration of life, still that is not a permanent settlement. But as far as the devotees are concerned, their assets — the achievement of devotional service and the consequent opulence of Vaikuṇṭha, even on this planet — are never destroyed. In this verse Kapiladeva addresses His mother as <i>śānta-rūpā, - <span style="color:#990012">ศานฺต-รูปา,</span></i> indicating that the opulences of devotees are fixed because devotees are eternally fixed in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere, which is called <i>śānta-rūpa - <span style="color:#990012">ศานฺต-รูป</span></i> because it is in the mode of pure goodness, undisturbed by the modes of passion and ignorance. Once one is fixed in the devotional service of the Lord, his position of transcendental service cannot be destroyed, and the pleasure and service simply increase unlimitedly. For the devotees engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere, there is no influence of time. In the material world the influence of time destroys everything, but in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere there is no influence of time or of the demigods because there are no demigods in the Vaikuṇṭha planets. Here our activities are controlled by different demigods; even if we move our hand and leg, the action is controlled by the demigods. But in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere there is no influence of the demigods or of time; therefore there is no question of destruction. When the time element is present, there is the certainty of destruction, but when there is no time element — past, present or future — then everything is eternal. Therefore this verse uses the words <i>na naṅkṣyanti, - <span style="color:#990012">น นงฺกฺษฺยนฺติ,</span></i> indicating that the transcendental opulences will never be destroyed.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25707" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The reason for freedom from destruction is also described. The devotees accept the Supreme Lord as the most dear personality and reciprocate with Him in different relationships. They accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the dearmost friend, the dearmost relative, the dearmost son, the dearmost preceptor, the dearmost well-wisher or the dearmost Deity. The Lord is eternal; therefore any relationship in which we accept Him is also eternal. It is clearly confirmed herein that the relationships cannot be destroyed, and therefore the opulences of those relationships are never destroyed. Every living entity has the propensity to love someone. We can see that if someone has no object of love, he generally directs his love to a pet animal like a cat or a dog. Thus the eternal propensity for love in all living entities is always searching for a place to reside. From this verse we can learn that we can love the Supreme Personality of Godhead as our dearmost object — as a friend, as a son, as a preceptor or as a well-wisher — and there will be no cheating and no end to such love. We shall eternally enjoy the relationship with the Supreme Lord in different aspects. A special feature of this verse is the acceptance of the Supreme Lord as the supreme preceptor. <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> was spoken directly by the Supreme Lord, and Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as <i>guru, - <span style="color:#990012">คุรุ,</span></i> or spiritual master. Similarly, we should accept only Kṛṣṇa as the supreme spiritual master.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25708" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kṛṣṇa, of course, means Kṛṣṇa and His confidential devotees; Kṛṣṇa is not alone. When we speak of Kṛṣṇa, “Kṛṣṇa” means Kṛṣṇa in His name, in His form, in His qualities, in His abode and in His associates. Kṛṣṇa is never alone, for the devotees of Kṛṣṇa are not impersonalists. For example, a king is always associated with his secretary, his commander, his servant and so much paraphernalia. As soon as we accept Kṛṣṇa and His associates as our preceptors, no ill effects can destroy our knowledge. In the material world the knowledge which we acquire may change because of the influence of time, but nevertheless the conclusions received from <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> directly from the speeches of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, can never change. There is no use interpreting <i>Bhagavad-gītā; - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> it is eternal.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25709" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, should be accepted as one’s best friend. He will never cheat. He will always give His friendly advice and friendly protection to the devotee. If Kṛṣṇa is accepted as a son, He will never die. Here we have a very loving son or child, but the father and mother, or those who are affectionate towards him, always hope, “May my son not die.” But Kṛṣṇa actually never will die. Therefore those who accept Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Lord, as their son will never be bereft of their son. In many instances devotees have accepted the Deity as a son. In Bengal there are many such instances, and even after the death of the devotee, the Deity performs the <i>śrāddha - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺราทฺธ</span></i> ceremony for the father. The relationship is never destroyed. People are accustomed to worship different forms of demigods, but in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> such a mentality is condemned; therefore one should be intelligent enough to worship only the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different forms such as Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, Sītā-Rāma and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Thus one will never be cheated. By worshiping the demigods one may elevate himself to the higher planets, but during the dissolution of the material world, the deity and the abode of the deity will be destroyed. But one who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead is promoted to the Vaikuṇṭha planets, where there is no influence of time, destruction or annihilation. The conclusion is that the time influence cannot act upon devotees who have accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as everything.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25715" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Unflinching devotional service, as described in these two verses, means engaging oneself in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or devotional service, accepting the Supreme Lord as all in all. Since the Supreme Lord is all-inclusive, if anyone worships Him with unflinching faith, he has automatically achieved all other opulences and performed all other duties. The Lord promises herein that He takes His devotee to the other side of birth and death. Lord Caitanya therefore recommended that one who aspires to go beyond birth and death should have no material possessions. This means that one should not try to be happy in this world or to be promoted to the heavenly world, nor should he try for material wealth, children, houses or cattle.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25716" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>How liberation is imperceptibly achieved by a pure devotee and what the symptoms are have been explained. For the conditioned soul there are two statuses of living. One status is in this present life, and the other is our preparation for the next life. If I am in the mode of goodness then I may be preparing for promotion to the higher planets, if I am in the mode of passion then I shall remain here in a society where activity is very prominent, and if I am in the mode of ignorance I may be degraded to animal life or a lower grade of human life. But for a devotee there is no concern for this life or the next life because in any life he does not desire elevation in material prosperity or a high-grade or low-grade life. He prays to the Lord, “My dear Lord, it does not matter where I am born, but let me be born, even as an ant, in the house of a devotee.” A pure devotee does not pray to the Lord for liberation from this material bondage. Actually, the pure devotee never thinks that he is fit for liberation. Considering his past life and his mischievous activities, he thinks that he is fit to be sent to the lowest region of hell. If in this life I am trying to become a devotee, this does not mean that in my many past lives I was one-hundred-percent pious. That is not possible. A devotee is therefore always conscious of his real position. Only by his full surrender to the Lord, by the Lord’s grace, are his sufferings made shorter. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> “Surrender unto Me, and I will give you protection from all kinds of sinful reaction.” That is His mercy. But this does not mean that one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord has committed no misdeeds in his past life. A devotee always prays, “For my misdeeds, may I be born again and again, but my only prayer is that I may not forget Your service.” The devotee has that much mental strength, and he prays to the Lord: “May I be born again and again, but let me be born in the home of Your pure devotee so that I may again get a chance to develop myself.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25717" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A pure devotee is not anxious to elevate himself in his next birth. He has already given up that sort of hope. In any life in which one is born, as a householder, or even as an animal, one must have some children, some resources or some possessions, but a devotee is not anxious to possess anything. He is satisfied with whatever is obtainable by God’s grace. He is not at all attached to improving his social status or improving the status of education of his children. He is not neglectful — he is dutiful — but he does not spend too much time on the upliftment of temporary household or social life. He fully engages in the service of the Lord, and for other affairs he simply spares as much time as absolutely necessary (<i>yathārham upayuñjataḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ยตฺหารฺหมฺ อุปยุญฺชตฮ</span></i>). Such a pure devotee does not care for what is going to happen in the next life or in this life; he does not care even for family, children or society. He fully engages in the service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that without the knowledge of the devotee the Lord arranges for him to be immediately transferred to the Lord’s transcendental abode just after he leaves his body. After quitting his body he does not go into the womb of another mother. The ordinary common living entity, after death, is transferred to the womb of another mother, according to his <i>karma, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม,</span></i> or activities, to take another type of body. But as far as the devotee is concerned, he is at once transferred to the spiritual world in the association of the Lord. That is the Lord’s special mercy. How it is possible is explained in the following verses. Because He is all-powerful, the Lord can do anything and everything. He can excuse all sinful reactions. He can immediately transfer a person to Vaikuṇṭhaloka. That is the inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is favorably disposed to the pure devotees.</p></div>

        <div id="bb25722" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is indicated herein that the cycle of birth and death cannot be stopped unless one is a pure devotee of the Supreme Lord. It is said, <i>hariṁ vinā na mṛtiṁ taranti. - <span style="color:#990012">หริํ วินา น มฺฤติํ ตรนฺติ.</span></i> One cannot surpass the cycle of birth and death unless one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same concept is confirmed herewith: one may take to the system of understanding the Absolute Truth by one’s own imperfect sensory speculation, or one may try to realize the self by the mystic <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> process; but whatever one may do, unless he comes to the point of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no process can give him liberation. One may ask if this means that those who are undergoing so much penance and austerity by strictly following the rules and regulations are endeavoring in vain. The answer is given by <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (10.2.32): <i>ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">เย′นเฺย′รวินฺทากฺษ วิมุกฺต-มานินฮ.</span></i> Lord Brahmā and other demigods prayed to the Lord when Kṛṣṇa was in the womb of Devakī: “My dear lotus-eyed Lord, there are persons who are puffed up with the thought that they have become liberated or one with God or have become God, but in spite of thinking in such a puffed-up way, their intelligence is not laudable. They are less intelligent.” It is stated that their intelligence, whether high or low, is not even purified. In purified intelligence a living entity cannot think otherwise than to surrender. <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> therefore confirms that purified intelligence arises in the person of a very wise man. <i>Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate. - <span style="color:#990012">พหูนาํ ชนฺมนามฺ อเนฺต ชฺญานวานฺ มาํ ปฺรปทฺยเต.</span></i> After many, many births, one who is actually advanced in intelligence surrenders unto the Supreme Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25723" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Without the surrendering process, one cannot achieve liberation. The <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> says, “Those who are simply puffed up, thinking themselves liberated by some nondevotional process, are not polished or clear in intelligence, for they have not yet surrendered unto You. In spite of executing all kinds of austerities and penances or even arriving at the brink of spiritual realization in Brahman realization, they think that they are in the effulgence of Brahman, but actually, because they have no transcendental activities, they fall down to material activities.” One should not be satisfied simply with knowing that one is Brahman. He must engage himself in the service of the Supreme Brahman; that is <i>bhakti. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ.</span></i> The engagement of Brahman should be the service of Parabrahman. It is said that unless one becomes Brahman one cannot serve Brahman. The Supreme Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the living entity is also Brahman. Without realization that he is Brahman, spirit soul, an eternal servitor of the Lord, if one simply thinks that he is Brahman, his realization is only theoretical. He has to realize and at the same time engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord; then he can exist in the Brahman status. Otherwise he falls down.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb25724" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> says that because nondevotees neglect the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, their intelligence is not sufficient, and therefore these persons fall down. The living entity must have some activity. If he does not engage in the activity of transcendental service, he must fall down to material activity. As soon as one falls down to material activity, there is no rescue from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated here by Lord Kapila, “Without My mercy” (<i>nānyatra mad bhagavataḥ - <span style="color:#990012">นานฺยตฺร มทฺ ภควตฮ</span></i>). The Lord is stated here to be Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, indicating that He is full of all opulences and is therefore perfectly competent to deliver one from the cycle of birth and death. He is also called <i>pradhāna - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรธาน</span></i> because He is the Supreme. He is equal to everyone, but to one who surrenders to Him He is especially favorable. It is also confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that the Lord is equal to everyone — no one is His enemy and no one is His friend — but that to one who surrenders unto Him He is especially inclined. By the grace of the Lord, simply by surrendering unto Him one can get out of this cycle of birth and death. Otherwise, one may go on in many, many lives and may many times attempt other processes for liberation.</p></div>

No one should think that nature is working automatically, without superintendence. The Vedic literature says that the clouds are controlled by the demigod Indra, heat is distributed by the sun-god, the soothing moonlight is distributed by Candra, and the air is blowing under the arrangement of the demigod Vāyu. But above all these demigods, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the chief living entity. <i>Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām - <span style="color:#990012">นิโตฺย นิตฺยานาํ เจตนศฺ เจตนานามฺ</span></i> (<i>Kaṭha Upaniṣad - <span style="color:#990012">กฐ อุปนิษทฺ</span></i> 2.2.13).

In the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> it is said, <i>bhīṣāsmād vātaḥ pavate bhīṣodeti sūryaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ภีษาสฺมาทฺ วาตฮ ปวเต ภีโษเทติ สูรฺยฮ:</span></i> “By fear of the Supreme Lord the wind-god and the sun-god are acting.” <i>Bhīṣāsmād agniś candraś ca mṛtyur dhāvati pañcamaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ภีษาสฺมาทฺ อคฺนิศฺ จนฺทฺรศฺ จ มฺฤตฺยุรฺ ธาวติ ปญฺจมฮ:</span></i> “Agni, Indra and Mṛtyu are also acting under His direction.” These are the statements of the <i>Vedas. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i></p></div>

These <i>yogīs</i> are not without knowledge and renunciation. To become a <i>bhakti-yogī - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยคี</span></i> means to automatically attain knowledge and renunciation. That is the consequent result of <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> In the <i>Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> First Canto, Second Chapter, it is also confirmed that one who engages in the devotional service of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, has complete transcendental knowledge and renunciation, and there is no explanation for these attainments. <i>Ahaitukī - <span style="color:#990012">อไหตุกี</span></i> — without reason, they come. Even if a person is completely illiterate, the transcendental knowledge of the scriptures is revealed unto him simply because of his engagement in devotional service. That is also stated in the Vedic literature. To anyone who has full faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the spiritual master, all the import of the Vedic literatures is revealed. He does not have to seek separately; the <i>yogī</i> who engages in devotional service is full in knowledge and renunciation. If there is a lack of knowledge and renunciation, it is to be understood that one is not in full devotional service. The conclusion is that one cannot be sure of entrance into the spiritual realm — in either the impersonal <i>brahmajyoti - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ</span></i> effulgence of the Lord or the Vaikuṇṭha planets within that Brahman effulgence — unless he is surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. The surrendered souls are called <i>akuto-bhaya. - <span style="color:#990012">อกุโต-ภย.</span></i> They are doubtless and fearless, and their entrance into the spiritual kingdom is guaranteed.</p></div>

One should fix his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa or His incarnation. To be fixed steadily in that freedom is the way of liberation. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja is an example. He fixed his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord, he spoke only on the pastimes of the Lord, he smelled only the flowers and <i>tulasī - <span style="color:#990012">ตุลสี</span></i> offered to the Lord, he walked only to the temple of the Lord, he engaged his hands in cleansing the temple, he engaged his tongue in tasting the foodstuff offered to the Lord, and he engaged his ears for hearing the great pastimes of the Lord. In that way all his senses were engaged. First of all, the mind should be engaged at the lotus feet of the Lord, very steadily and naturally. Because the mind is the master of the senses, when the mind is engaged, all the senses become engaged. That is <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> <i>Yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> means controlling the senses. The senses cannot be controlled in the proper sense of the term; they are always agitated. This is true also with a child — how long can he be forced to sit down silently? It is not possible. Even Arjuna said, <i>cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa: - <span style="color:#990012">จญฺจลํ หิ มนฮ กฺฤษฺณ:</span></i> “The mind is always agitated.” The best course is to fix the mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. <i>Mano mayy arpitaṁ sthiram. - <span style="color:#990012">มโน มยฺยฺ อรฺปิตํ สฺตฺหิรมฺ.</span></i> If one seriously engages in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is the highest perfectional stage. All Kṛṣṇa conscious activities are on the highest perfectional level of human life.</p></div>
