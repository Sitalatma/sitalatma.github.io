<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 36<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana seeks Maareecha's help to abduct Seetha. He asks Maareecha to assume the shape of a golden-deer and lure Seetha, and then
Seetha asks Rama and Lakshmana to fetch that golden-deer. If Rama and Lakshmana are distracted from the hermitage, Ravana can safely abduct Seetha.
Listening to this Maareecha is struck dead, because he is already struck with the arrow of Rama when he was in Tataka forest. As such, Maareecha
tries to explain Ravana about Rama's quintessence.</p>

delight in the disservice of all created beings.&#39; Thus, he is Supreme Person.
</p>

<p class="comment">
But Rama Tilaka, on the other hand refutes this derivation stating that Ravana is not an out and out 
devotee of Rama, and these many <em>adhyaadhaara</em>-s &#39;ellipses&#39; need not be brought in to justify 
mythological import to Ramayana. There is a section of pundits that argue Ramayana precedes <em>18 
puraaNaa-s </em>the 18 mythological treatises, and they refuse to believe that Ravana is NOT a 
devotee of Rama.
</p>

<p class="comment">
In anyway, the innuendo incorporated in certain verses has given rise to diverse commentaries, but 
the unity of Ramayana is kept up, either by Shaivaites or Vaishnavaite or other sects of Hindu 
thinking. &nbsp;</p>

"Thereafter Rama will be enervated by the abduction of his wife, and then surely and conveniently I wish to retaliate him if he is
going to come up against me, for my inner-soul will be firstly gratified with its volition, namely possessing Seetha." Thus Ravana requested
Maareecha. [3-36-21]</p>

&quot;When I abduct that venerable Seetha, the wife of Elephant like Rama, my body gets harmed like an 
eclipsed moon, but my soul gets fulfilled as I desire eternal salvation, and I can get it evidently 
and impeccably at the hand of Rama, owing to the ill-virtue of my abduction of Seetha.</p>

<p class="comment">
The eclipsing planet Rahu may hide moon temporarily by which the world looses moonshine for a while. 
If Ravana temporarily hides Seetha, as Rahu hides the moon, Rama, who metaphors with the three 
worlds, may be in gloom temporarily. But neither Rahu nor Ravana are illuminated or enlightened with 
the presence of the moonbeams of Seetha, alias Goddess Lakshmi, for they tried to seize that 
all-illuminating Moon/Seetha by force.
