			<p class="comment">
			Comment: Touching/sipping waters <em>āchamana, pariṣechana</em> , before undertaking

			replete with such gems called thoughts, and an ear-pleasing legend, as well. [1-3-7, 
			8]</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Comment: The pleasures and gains of the humans are <em>puruṣārtha</em> -s, in 
			its axiological meaning. Hindus have four such <em>puruṣārtha</em> -s [namely 
			human values,] <em>dharma</em> probity <em>artha</em> prosperity, <em>kāma</em> 
			pleasures, and finally <em>moksha</em> , blessedness. Of these four only the first 
			three, <em>dharma, artha, kāma</em> are usually referred, and they are called
			<em>tri-varga</em> . The final one <em>moksha</em> is not often quoted. Dhrama 
			is the driving force. <em>chodanā lakshaṇārtho dharmaḥ</em> - Jaimini. Hence 
			dharma is the prescribed conduct, either by scriptures or by the society, and 
			it does not entail any merit or demerit, but just an obligatory conduct or duty 
			or, say &#39;categorical imperative&#39; of Kant. And the other two, <em>artha, kāma</em> 
			, are the means of dharma, and all leading to moksha. These two great epics Ramayana 
			and ṃahabharata are structured on these <em>puruṣārtha</em> -s alone. Thus though 
			Ramayana is abounding with the accounts of richness and glory of all kinds of 
			wealth, which is secondary to human values, its main import is the virtuosity 
			of human living. The ocean, though abounding with other less valuable items like 
			conch shells, mother-of-pearl shells etc., its gems beneath all these peripherals 
			are of high value. Thus this is an ear pleasing by its musical melody and heart 
			pleasing by its meaningful wording. Further, it is pleasant for its import is 
			in accordance with all the scriptures.</p>

			Thus, they say, Uttara Ramayana cannot be ascribed to Valmiki. Hence the word
