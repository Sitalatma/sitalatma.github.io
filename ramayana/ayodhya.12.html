sought the king's protection, descended into his lap. The hawk which closely followed it, demanded it back from the king; contending that the bird
had been allotted to it as its food by providence and the king had no right to rob it of its quarry. The king; however was not prepared to forsake
the fugitive on any account and agreed to part with his own flesh in order to indemnify the hawk. The hawk however out weighed the king's flesh every
time he chopped it from his body till at last he ascended the scale himself and thus offered himself in exchange for the pigeon. **Alarka*=The royal
sage Alarka parted with his own eyes in order to implement a boon granted by him to a blind Brahmana who asked for the king's eyes in order to have
