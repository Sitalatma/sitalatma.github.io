<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 71<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seeing Atikaya, the colossal demon, coming towards him on a chariot, Rama asks Vibhishana who he is Vibhishana introduces Atikaya, as
being a son of Ravana and Dhanyamali (another consort of Ravana). When some commanders of monkeys try to attack Atikaya, he chops off trees and crags
hurled at him. Without fighting further with the monkeys, Atikaya, moves forward to Rama and challenges him for a fight. Then Lakshmana with his bow
and arrows begins to fight with Atikaya. By a sharp arrow struck by Atikaya in Lakshmana's chest, Lakshmana is enraged and releases an arrow employed
with a missile of fire and Atikaya attacks it with an arrow employed with a solar missile. On the advice the wind-god appeared before him, Lakshmana
finally hurls an arrow employed with a missile of Brahma and chips off the head of Atikaya.</p>
