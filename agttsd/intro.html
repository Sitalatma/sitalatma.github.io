Despite freezing cold, scorching heat, relentless rain, and maddening wind off the sides of frozen mountains, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> warriors bring the mercy of his books to every door. Tolerating the constant changes in weather, drinking water, sleeping places, and food, they go from town to town, village to village, bringing a gift of love rarely seen in this world, and even more rarely attained. Tolerance is their regulative principle: tolerating the taunts and shouts of ignorant and trivial onlookers; tolerating being pushed, shoved, beaten, or spit upon; tolerating needless police interference; tolerating the pains in the back or feet; and above all, tolerating the mind. Such tolerance is found only in the greatest of yogis who have practiced their mystic art for so many years. The mercy of the Lord on His <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> warriors is hard to describe, but He is inspiring me to do so. May He help me in this endeavor.

Without concern for their bodily comforts or care for the whims of the constantly complaining mind and senses, they are promptly on the street early in the day and remain there, till all the materialistically minded people have gone home for the night. When they think of the so-called pleasure of the frui&shy;tive workers, their lips curl in disgust and they spit on it. But remembering their spiritual master's warning not to be too proud of their renunciation—for that can lead one to fall&shy;down—they regret this spontaneous external display of their higher taste and again fix their minds on the preaching mission. Who can maintain attachment to the material world after having tasted the nectar of the Lord's mercy? O devotees of the Lord, hear me well. If you wish to remain attached to home, family, nation, society, and the rest, do not go out preaching the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, for on the streets of the cities, towns, and villages, the flute sound of the Lord may be heard, even today, inviting His devoted followers to return to the shelter of His holy lotus feet.

Some of these transcendental warriors have been distributing for years, without stop, day in and day out. They are fully dedicated to the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> service of their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Although such souls are rarely to be found in this world, the materialists cannot imagine that there are only a handful of them. "I see you people everywhere. How many of you are there anyway, thousands?" Due to the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee's intensity of endeavor and boundless enthusiasm, the materialists cannot imagine that such an impact comes from a handful of dedicated men. This is the potency of one <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee; he can deliver a whole country by his spiritual determination to bring the books of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da to every door.

The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees have the greatest association in the universe, for Kṣī&shy;ro&shy;da&shy;ka&shy;śā&shy;yi Viṣ&shy;ṇu, the Pa&shy;ra&shy;mā&shy;tmā, the Su&shy;per&shy;soul within the heart of all living beings, is also a <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee. Caring for all living beings as the eternal spiritual guide within the Su&shy;per&shy;soul is always inducing the conditioned soul to walk in the path of the waiting distributor, hear what the devotee has to say, reach into his wallet, and take out the biggest note he has. All <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are glorious, for they know well that without their transcendental partner, the Su&shy;per&shy;soul, no one would take a book. Because of His constant transcendental association, the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees have forgotten the meaning of the word "loneliness," although they can see it on the faces of the people on the streets. And remember, only a devotee knows the real meaning of the word "love."

The concept of mercy can be understood only by examining the mercy the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees pour on the seemingly undeserving souls lost in an ocean of ignorance. Only by carefully studying this mercy can we know how Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya and Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da poured Their divine grace on the conditioned souls five hundred years ago. No need to wonder how it happened then, for it is happening again now. Only the most fortunate persons are born at this time, for they can accumulate piles of pious activities and acquire the seed of devotional service by purchasing a book of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's. If they simply read it, the seed of <em>bhak&shy;ti</em> will quickly sprout in their hearts. We look through the many letters of appreciation from the readers of our books, and we sit stunned, unable to fathom the unlimited mercy of the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees.

The householders who remain at home with their economic problems, family encumbrances, and needs secretly lament that they cannot join these liberated <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men and women who wander freely, without restriction, throughout the three worlds. Although the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are fully capable of enjoying their senses to the greatest degree, they are averse to doing so, for they only wish to please their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Family life, household affairs, children, problems, housing bills, <em>gu&shy;ru&shy;ku&shy;la</em> costs, and all the other unfortunate "requirements" in a world covered by <em>māyā</em>'s unique power seem distant and unreal to those desiring to shower the rain of mercy on souls burning in the fire of material existence. They cannot discriminate between the cries of some living entities posing as their babies and those of the conditioned souls on the street who are lost and bewildered, without anyone to care for them. Considering themselves the real protectors of the living entities who stand before them, the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees nurse these lost souls back to life with the milk of kindness and the all-powerful drug, the holy name of the Lord.

Even if they win the weekly <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> competition, they still know that the real victory is to conquer the senses and the mind. The sincere and enthusiastic cheers of the devotee audience, honestly ecstatic to hear the wonderful results of their worthy heroes, only add another burden to the sincere distributor's struggle, and therefore the experienced "winners" inwardly laugh, fully aware that this sophisticated snare of <em>māyā</em> is waiting to find some subtle weakness and ruin their <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> spirit. Who in the three worlds can give up attachment to the fruits of their results? No one. But even the demigods learn a good lesson in renunciation by secretly observing the Sunday meetings of the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men in the temple. They are amazed at the submissive attitude of these devoted souls, completely devoid of the concept of self glorification. Indeed, such great souls push off all attempts to glorify them as if they were avoiding disease personified. Who can understand their own minds besides themselves? We can only pray to associate with such selfless personalities life after life. A birth as a bug in the book bag of such great souls is superior to becoming Brahmā devoid of the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> spirit.

They are gentle souls who are kind to all. Who can be more gentle than the devoted <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees who only think of the advancement of the fallen conditioned souls devoid of all understanding of spiritual life?

The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are like a wish-fulfilling tree, for they know the real desires of people: to be happy, peaceful, and eternally situated in their natural, constitutional positions as parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. Because the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are displaying their kindness throughout every town, we can understand something of the vast mercy of Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya; otherwise, it would remain a mere theory. I offer again and again my humble obeisances unto the feet of such exalted Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas as these, and pray that I may assist them in any way I can.

Because of their devotion and dedicated endeavors, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books are all over the world. From Nome, Alaska, east to Tokyo, Japan, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books have been distributed in massive numbers and have found Their way into nearly every town and village. Where no books could conceivably go, these books go, for They are transcendental living entities, capable of intelligent and directed motion, wishing to bestow the greatest mercy on the conditioned souls throughout the world. These books are creating a revolution in the hearts of the people absorbed in a misguided civilization seemingly bent on self-destruction. It seems that there are people everywhere interested in the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gitā</em>, <em>Śrī&shy;mad Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>, and any literature from Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da they can get their hands on. None but the rich, proud, and arrogant avoid the nectar of this saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na mission. And now the Soviets are importing our books and encouraging their translation. Need I say more than this?

Someone once said that some demigods have appeared as human beings to distribute these books in great quantities. Although this sounds nice, a real <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee does not believe it; for after all, he knows he was saved by his spiritual master. We were lost in a pit of ignorance and knew nothing of the higher realms of reality, when the spiritual master saved us from the eternal doom. We were fallen then, and outside of the mercy emanating from this transcendental literature, we would still be fallen now. A <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee is intelligent and knows that he is personally nothing but the mercy of his spiritual master. And he is happy in this understanding. All <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are happy simply being instruments in this great mission. They know that the books distribute Themselves when we surrender to Them and Their mission. Actually we have been picked up from the lowest platform of existence and elevated to very high positions simply because we are associating with the supremely opulent Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and we are happy simply knowing Him as our master. As the servants of the king live on the same level as the king, so the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are glorified and living nicely as servants of the supreme controller. Is it possible to attain more opulence than this?

They drive their vans with great care and attention, filling up with petrol, regularly changing the oil, and checking the water, the anti-freeze, and the tires, for they consider their <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> vehicle as reverential paraphernalia of the Lord. They take care of their vans as if these vehicles were members of Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental family, representatives of Ga&shy;ru&shy;ḍa. Every <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> warrior knows well that without these faithful carriers of the book Deities, the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission would quickly grind to a halt. Never driving too fast, although always impatient to bring knowledge to every town, the saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;ners depart at the proper time to reach their destination without hurry. Even though Kṛṣṇa is protecting them, they never want to disturb Kṛṣṇa's transcendental pastimes by forcing Him to catch their van as it is rolling off a slippery road. They are models of safe and cautious driving, since they know that their cargo, the empowered <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees and these transcendental books, is more valuable than piles of gold and jewels.

They are so humble and meek that although they know well that they are engaged in the most important devotional service of all, the direct preaching mission of the Lord, they never demean the service of the other devotees who live in the temple and support the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. Thus they are glorious in the eyes of all. They are devoid of the stain of false pride, for they know that without the support of the devotees in the temple <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> could not go on. The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are thankful to those dedicated souls taking the responsibility of washing the floors, worshiping the Deity, and cooking the noon offering. Every <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee knows perfectly well how hard it is to live in the temple, for without having to struggle in the preaching mission, control of the mind and senses is most difficult to achieve. Therefore, out of humility, like trees overloaded with the burden of ripe fruits, they bend low during their weekends in the temple, offering their respects to even a tiny ant. Having seen enough materialists during the week, the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees know how rare it is for a devotee of the Lord to be fully engaged in devotional service in the temple.

They care about the people to whom they distribute. Not considering numbers more important, they really want people to read and understand these transcendental gifts. If they did not care about the fallen souls, how could the devotees go on, year after year, day in and day out, sustained by the satisfaction of the Lord! These <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> warriors want to die on the battlefield. They wish to continue to distribute this literature in some form or another throughout their whole lives. They know nothing else than this intense and gratifying mission. The <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees know an open secret: if they can just continue distributing, they will get the mercy of their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and, in this very life, go straight back home, back to Godhead. Keeping this dear&shy;most secret close to their hearts, they only wish that all other living entities would also take up devotional service and become auspicious and glorious too, for it is easy, sublime, and beyond the material world.
