Among these classes, women and <i>śūdras, - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ,</span></i> who generally have no contact with the hearing and chanting of <i>hari-kathā, - <span style="color:#990012">หริ-กตฺหา,</span></i> are on account of their very ignorance special candidates for the mercy of great souls. The members of the other three <i>varṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณสฺ,</span></i> becoming fit for achieving the lotus feet of Hari by second birth through Vedic initiation (<i>śrauta-janma - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺระอุต-ชนฺม</span></i>), nevertheless become confused by concocted interpretations of the <i>Vedas. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i> Presuming themselves to be great scholars, although not understanding the essential meaning of <i>karma, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม,</span></i> they become flatterers of other deities in their greed for fruitive results and ridicule the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are fixed in family life, attached to mundane gossip and indifferent to the devotional service of Viṣṇu and the Vaiṣṇavas. They are maddened by material opulences and pleasures, devoid of real discrimination and intelligence and always function on the mental platform. But such attachment to family life and so on is most natural for the mass of people, even though it is against the best advice of <i>śāstra. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺร.</span></i> To become disentangled from such life in all respects is the principal teaching of the <i>Vedas.</i> Real wealth is that conducive to the faithful execution of the duty of the soul, not that which exists simply for selfish sense gratification. As a consequence of the desire to indulge the senses, men and women couple together to produce children. Engaging in animal slaughter apart from that necessary for performance of sacrifice, these human animals themselves suffer violence in the next life. If because of excessive greed for one’s own pleasure one commits violence against living beings, he is also attacking Lord Śrī Hari, who is present in the bodies of all living entities as the Supersoul. Opposed to Lord Vāsudeva, ignorant self-cheaters completely carry out their own ruination and enter into hell.</p></div>

In Dvāpara-yuga He is of dark blue complexion, wears a yellow garment, is marked by Śrīvatsa and other signs, has such names as Vāsudeva and is worshiped in His Deity form by the regulations of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> and <i>tantras. - <span style="color:#990012">ตนฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> In Kali-yuga He is golden in color, is accompanied by associates who are His primary and secondary limbs and His weapons, is absorbed in <i>kṛṣṇa-kīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-กีรฺตน</span></i> and is worshiped by the performance of <i>saṅkīrtana-yajña. - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน-ยชฺญ.</span></i> Since in Kali-yuga all the goals of human life can be achieved simply by the glorification of the holy name of Lord Śrī Hari, those who can appreciate the real essence of things praise Kali-yuga.

The Personality of Godhead, Śrī Hari, appears in the hearts of devotees who know no other shelter than Him and causelessly drives away all evil desires from the devotees’ hearts. Videharāja Nimi, having heard elaborate descriptions of <i>bhāgavata-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม</span></i> from the mouths of the <i>nava-yogendras, - <span style="color:#990012">นว-โยเคนฺทฺรสฺ,</span></i> offered worship to them with a satisfied mind.

Even by meditating upon Kṛṣṇa in a spirit of enmity, such kings as Śiśupāla attained an equal status to Him. So to attempt to say anything more about the perfect achievement of great souls such as Vasudeva, who enjoy intimate loving relations with Kṛṣṇa, would be a useless endeavor.</p></div>

However, for the nondevotees there is no such facility. As soon as the conditioned soul becomes indifferent to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, he is immediately attracted by the temporary varieties of matter and becomes a slave of inauspicious desires. Thus the conditioned soul, devoid of devotion for the Lord, completely forgets the transcendental bliss of the spiritual world, which is enjoyed in five transcendental <i>rasas. - <span style="color:#990012">รสสฺ.</span></i> Although the devotees are not overcome by the sense gratification offered by the demigods, the demigods themselves become absorbed in material form, taste and smell.

Thus they remain hovering in a dreamlike state, imagining different types of material sense gratification, and forget their eternal relationship with the Personality of Godhead.

Camasa Muni now describes the system of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม,</span></i> because this system is meant to gradually purify those who are inimical to the Supreme Lord, bringing them back to their constitutional position of love of Godhead. Similarly, the <i>virāṭ-rūpa, - <span style="color:#990012">วิราฏฺ-รูป,</span></i> or universal form of the Lord, is an imaginary form meant to help the gross materialists gradually understand the position of the Personality of Godhead. Since the foolish materialist cannot understand anything beyond matter, he is encouraged to see the entire universe as a personal form of the Supreme Lord’s body. The impersonal conception of formlessness is a mere negation of temporary material variety without any concept of the Lord’s spiritual potency. The impersonal view is another kind of material speculative conception. The Supreme Lord is full of spiritual potencies under the principal headings <i>hlādinī, - <span style="color:#990012">หฺลาทินี,</span></i> or unlimited bliss, <i>sandhinī, - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺธินี,</span></i> or eternal existence, and <i>saṁvit, - <span style="color:#990012">สํวิตฺ,</span></i> or omniscience. It is understood from this verse that the <i>varṇāśrama-dharma</i> system generated from the universal form of the Lord is a program offered by the Lord to engage the conditioned souls in a complete social and religious system that gradually brings them back home, back to Godhead.</p></div>

It has already been described that the four spiritual and occupational orders of life are generated from the body of the Lord. In fact, the Supreme Lord is the source of everything, as described in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (10.8): <i>ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">อหํ สรฺวสฺย ปฺรภวฮ.</span></i> Those who foolishly do not inquire into the position of the Personality of Godhead, as well as those who disrespect the Lord in spite of having heard of His transcendental position, will certainly fall down from the <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span> - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span>-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span></i> system, as described by the words <i>sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">สฺตฺหานาทฺ ภฺรษฺฏาฮ.</span></i> The words <i>patanty adhaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ปตนฺตฺยฺ อธฮ</span></i> indicate that one who falls from the <i>varṇāśrama</i> system will have no means of avoiding sinful activities; nor will such a person receive any credit for performing sacrifice, and thus he will gradually sink down into lower and lower species of life in hellish conditions. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has pointed out that the original cause of offending the Lord and falling down from one’s position is one’s not learning how to properly worship a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to offer respectful obeisances and worship to the bona fide spiritual master automatically offers proper worship to the Supreme Lord. Without the mercy of a bona fide spiritual master, even a so-called religious man will gradually become atheistic, offend the Lord by foolish speculation and fall into a hellish condition of life. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has pointed out that the <i>puruṣa - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ</span></i> mentioned in this verse is Lord Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, who is glorified in the <i>Puruṣa-sūkta - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ-สูกฺต</span></i> prayers. If one is proud of his high social position and enviously thinks that the Lord is also a creation of nature and that there is no absolute entity who is the origin of all beings, then such a puffed-up fool will certainly fall down from the <i>varṇāśrama</i> system and become just like an unregulated animal.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77706" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous verse it was explained that some persons are ignorant of the glories of the Personality of Godhead (<i>na bhajanti - <span style="color:#990012">น ภชนฺติ</span></i>), whereas others, although aware of the Lord, ridicule Him or state that the Lord is also material (<i>avajānanti - <span style="color:#990012">อวชานนฺติ</span></i>). In this verse the first class, namely the ignorant, are described as fit candidates for the mercy of a pure devotee. The word <i>dūre - <span style="color:#990012">ทูเร</span></i> indicates those who have little opportunity to hear and chant the glories of the Lord. According to Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura they can be explained as <i>ye sādhu-saṅga-bhāgya-hīnāḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">เย สาธุ-สงฺค-ภาคฺย-หีนาฮ,</span></i> those who are bereft of the association of saintly persons and pure devotees. Generally, those who are advanced in the spiritual science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness avoid contact with women and low-class men. In general, women are lusty, and <i>śūdras - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ</span></i> and other low-class men are habitually addicted to materialistic habits such as smoking, drinking and woman hunting. Therefore, Caitanya Mahāprabhu warned the <i>sādhus, - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุสฺ,</span></i> or saintly persons, to avoid intimate connection with women and low-class men. The practical result of such a restriction is that women and lower-class men are often bereft of the opportunity to hear the glories of the Lord chanted by saintly persons; thus Śrī Camasa Muni instructs the King that he should especially give his mercy to such fallen persons.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77707" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda, was severely criticized in India for giving all classes of men and women the opportunity to take part in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Indeed, the caste <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> of India and other persons concerned only with ritualistic formalities were shocked that Śrīla Prabhupāda allowed women and persons born in low-class families to take part freely in the Vaiṣṇava culture and even become initiated as bona fide <i>brāhmaṇas. - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ.</span></i> However, Śrīla Prabhupāda could understand that in this age practically everyone is fallen. He saw that if spiritual life were to be limited to the so-called higher classes, there would be no possibility of spreading a genuine spiritual movement all around the world. The mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so great and the holy name of Kṛṣṇa so potent that any man, woman, child or even animal can become purified by chanting Kṛṣṇa’s name and taking <i>prasādam, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาทมฺ,</span></i> the sanctified remnants of Kṛṣṇa’s food. In Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement, no sincere person is restricted from achieving the highest perfection of self-realization. Whereas the impersonalists and <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> tend to be selfishly concerned with their individual realization and achievement of mystic power, it has always been the custom of the Vaiṣṇavas to be merciful to all classes of living entities.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77708" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is understood that the conversation between the <i>nava-yogendras - <span style="color:#990012">นว-โยเคนฺทฺรสฺ</span></i> and King Nimi took place approximately at the time of Lord Rāmacandra, many hundreds of thousands of years ago. But in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> which was spoken only five thousand years ago, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself also states that any person, despite his material situation of life, can become the most dear devotee of the Lord by full surrender to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, the fallen people of Kali-yuga should take advantage of the special mercy of the Vaiṣṇavas and join the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to perfect their lives and go back home, back to Godhead.</p></div>

Being desirous of sense gratification and opulent life, they say that there is nothing more than this.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77717" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Prabhupāda’s purport to this verse of <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> gives a clear picture of the offensive class of men described therein. “People in general are not very intelligent, and due to their ignorance they are most attached to the fruitive activities recommended in the <i>karma-kāṇḍa - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ</span></i> portions of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i> They do not want anything more than sense gratificatory proposals for enjoying life in heaven, where wine and women are available and material opulence is very common. In the <i>Vedas</i> many sacrifices are recommended for elevation to the heavenly planets, especially the <i>jyotiṣṭoma - <span style="color:#990012">โชฺยติโษฺฏม</span></i> sacrifices. In fact, it is stated that anyone desiring elevation to heavenly planets must perform these sacrifices, and men with a poor fund of knowledge think that this is the whole purpose of Vedic wisdom. It is very difficult for such inexperienced persons to be situated in the determined action of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As fools are attached to the flowers of poisonous trees without knowing the results of such attractions, similarly, unenlightened men are attracted by such heavenly opulence and the sense enjoyment thereof.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77718" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“In the <i>karma-kāṇḍa - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ</span></i> sections of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> it is said that those who perform the four monthly penances become eligible to drink the <i>soma-rasa - <span style="color:#990012">โสม-รส</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โสม-รส</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โสม-รส</span></i> beverage to become immortal and happy forever. Even on this earth some are very eager to have <i>soma-rasa</i> to become strong and fit to enjoy sense gratification. Such persons have no faith in liberation from material bondage, and they are very much attached to the pompous ceremonies of Vedic sacrifices. They are generally sensual, and they do not want anything other than the heavenly pleasures of life. It is understood that there are gardens called Nandana-kānana, in which there is good opportunity for association with angelic, beautiful women and having a profuse supply of <i>soma-rasa</i> wine. Such bodily happiness is certainly sensual; therefore there are those who are purely attached to material, temporary happiness, as lords of the material world.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77719" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The significant point in this verse is that such bewildered materialists who have become attracted to the materialistic portions of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> (<i>muhyanty āmnāya-vādinaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">มุหฺยนฺตฺยฺ อามฺนาย-วาทินฮ</span></i>) desire to ignore the supreme proprietorship of the Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme enjoyer (<i>bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām - <span style="color:#990012">โภกฺตารํ ยชฺญ-ตปสามฺ</span></i>). And at the same time they wish to preserve their exalted status as followers of the Vedic principles. Such duplicitous persons take shelter of materialistic philosophers, such as Jaimini, who deny the existence of God as a tangible principle (<i>īśvarāsiddheḥ - <span style="color:#990012">อีศฺวราสเิทฺธฮ</span></i>) and therefore recommend material fruitive activities as the highest knowable truth. Such so-called Vedic philosophers amount to little more than polished atheists and are therefore understood to be <i>anīśvara-vādinaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">อนีศฺวร-วาทินฮ,</span></i> or those who preach against the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although foolish materialistic followers of the <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span></i> system desire to maintain their exalted status as Āryans, or twice-born men, and at the same time neglect the Personality of Godhead, it is clearly stated in the <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (11.5.3), <i>sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">สฺตฺหานาทฺ ภฺรษฺฏาฮ ปตนฺตฺยฺ อธฮ:</span></i> such persons inevitably fall from their position into a degraded condition of life. As confirmed in this verse by the word <i>muhyanti, - <span style="color:#990012">มุหฺยนฺติ,</span></i> they fall into the darkness of ignorance. Sometimes such pompous persons even present themselves as <i>gurus. - <span style="color:#990012">คุรุสฺ.</span></i> However, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has pointed out that they are actually <i>laghu, - <span style="color:#990012">ลฆุ,</span></i> or flimsy, rather than <i>guru, - <span style="color:#990012">คุรุ,</span></i> or heavy with Vedic knowledge. It is one’s ultimate duty to oneself (<i>svārtha-gati - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวารฺตฺห-คติ</span></i>) and to the Personality of Godhead to give up all materialistic activities characterized by <i>karma - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม</span></i> and <i>jñāna - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาน</span></i> and surrender fully at the lotus feet of the Lord. Only the most unfortunate person will consider that there is a higher pleasure than ecstatic surrender at the lotus feet of Gokulānanda, the Personality of Godhead.</p></div>

Materialistic women are uninterested in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord and strive for their own selfish happiness. Therefore they eagerly take service from their husbands and become most discouraged if the husband prefers to serve the Personality of Godhead. Being lost in such a fool’s paradise, both husband and wife mutually encourage each other in temporary happiness. They do not like to speak or hear about the pastimes of the Lord, but prefer to discuss their own families. Still, the devotees of the Lord, being mature in the mode of goodness, are always ready to act mercifully toward such conditioned souls, who are just like vain animals. When the devotees of the Lord preach that human beings should not slaughter animals, materialistic householders are very often astonished and inquire if it is actually possible to subsist on a vegetarian diet. Thus being completely ignorant of the material mode of goodness, what to speak of spiritual knowledge, such condemned materialists have no hope beyond the mercy of the devotees of the Lord.</p></div>

They prefer to cultivate knowledge of illicit sex by discussing their sexual partners and experiences.

The materialistic sense gratifiers eagerly call one another on the telephone, congregate in clubs and committees, and enthusiastically go on hunting, drinking and gambling excursions, thus filling their lives with the mode of ignorance. They have neither the time nor the inclination to discuss the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa. Unfortunately, they neglect the Supreme Lord, who therefore severely punishes such foolish persons in order to bring them back to their senses. Everything belongs to the Lord, and everything is meant for the Lord’s enjoyment.

Every materialistic person actually feels that he is the most intelligent person, and thus he has no time to hear the actual truth.

Such recognition of the Personality of Godhead is the beginning of all auspiciousness and happiness for the conditioned soul.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77754" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Those who are not situated in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness are always inclined toward material sense gratification in the form of illicit sex, meat-eating and intoxication. They simply desire a party life of eat, drink and be merry. Such materialistic persons are unwilling to give up such temporary gratification because they are firmly bound up in the bodily concept of life. For such persons there are numerous Vedic injunctions for rituals that bestow material sense pleasure in a regulated manner. The conditioned soul thereby becomes accustomed to indirectly worshiping the Supreme Lord by accepting the austerity of regulated sense gratification in obedience to the Vedic way of life. Through purification the living entity gradually develops a higher taste and becomes directly attracted to the spiritual nature of the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77755" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Sometimes the fallen practitioners of the <i>karma-kāṇḍa - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑ</span></i> section of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> assert that the material fruitive results of Vedic ceremonies should never be given up, because they are prescribed by religious scriptures. For example, there is a Vedic injunction that in the proper season a husband must approach his wife at night at least five days after her menstrual period, if the wife has properly bathed and cleansed herself. Thus, a responsible householder should engage in religious sex life.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77756" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The injunction that one must approach his wife for sex life is explained by the Vaiṣṇava <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> as follows. Within the material world almost every man is very lusty and desires passionate sex life with every attractive woman he meets, or with any woman at all. Actually, for an ordinary materialistic man it is an accomplishment if he can restrict himself to relationships with his lawfully wedded wife. But because familiarity breeds contempt, the natural tendency is for the husband to gradually become envious or resentful of the wife and desire illicit connections with other women. Such a mentality is most sinful and abominable, and the Vedic scripture therefore orders that one must approach his actual wife, with a desire to beget children, and thus curtail the tendency toward illicit sexual connection with other women. Were there no such Vedic injunction ordering one to approach his wife, many men would naturally be inclined to neglect their wives and pollute other women by illicit connection.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77757" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>However, such an injunction for conditioned souls does not apply to great souls who are fixed on the spiritual platform and are transcendental to material sex desire. As stated in this verse, <i>nivṛttir iṣṭā: - <span style="color:#990012">นิวฺฤตฺติรฺ อิษฺฏา:</span></i> the actual purpose of the Vedic scriptures is to bring one back home, back to Godhead, back to the spiritual world. It is clearly stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa in <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> <i>yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram: - <span style="color:#990012">ยํ ยํ วาปิ สฺมรนฺ ภาวํ ตฺยชตฺยฺ อเนฺต กเลวรมฺ:</span></i> whatever we think of at the time of death will determine our next body.</p></div>
    
        <div id="bb77758" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>anta-kāle ca mām eva<br />smaran muktvā kalevaram<br />yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ<br />yāti nāsty atra saṁśayaḥ</i></em></div>

        <div id="bb77760" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>If one remembers Kṛṣṇa, he is immediately transferred to the eternal planet of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, since all the Vedic scriptures are meant for knowing Kṛṣṇa (<i>vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">เวไทศฺ จ สไรฺวรฺ อหมฺ เอว เวทฺยฮ</span></i>), the ultimate goal of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> cannot be any type of absorption in the material senses, either licit or illicit. The Vedic regulations governing married sex life are actually meant to prevent sinful illicit sex. However, one should not foolishly conclude that a lusty attraction to his wife’s naked body is the perfection of self-realization and Vedic elevation. The actual perfection of spiritual life is to become free from all material desires, <i>nivṛtti, - <span style="color:#990012">นิวฺฤตฺติ,</span></i> and to fix the mind on Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77761" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Similarly there are other injunctions, governing the regulated consumption of liquor and meat. Those who are mad after meat-eating are instructed to perform Vedic ceremonies by which they are permitted to consume five types of five-clawed animals, namely the rhinoceros, turtle, rabbit, porcupine and lizard. Similarly, the consumption of specific liquors is allowed during highly restricted sacrifices performed on specific days of the year at great expense. In this way, other types of drunkenness and cruel animal slaughter are prohibited. One is gradually purified by performing such sacrifices, and he develops a distaste for such foolish activities as meat-eating and the drinking of liquor. The Vedic rules and regulations that gradually restrict sense gratification are called <i>vidhi. - <span style="color:#990012">วิธิ.</span></i> The word <i>niyama - <span style="color:#990012">นิยม</span></i> refers to injunctions governing activities that human beings ordinarily would not be inclined to perform. For example, it is said, <i>ahar ahaḥ sandhyām upāsīta: - <span style="color:#990012">อหรฺ อหฮ สนฺธฺยามฺ อุปาสีต:</span></i> “One should chant Gāyatrī <i>mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺร</span></i> at the three junctions of the day, every day.” It is also stated, <i>māgha-snānaṁ prakurvīta: - <span style="color:#990012">มาฆ-สฺนานํ ปฺรกุรฺวีต:</span></i> “One must take bath daily, even during the coldest months of winter.” Such injunctions prescribe activities that ordinarily would be neglected.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77762" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Although it has been mentioned above that there are injunctions against neglecting one’s lawful wife, there is no injunction against totally neglecting meat-eating. In other words, killing of animals is considered most abominable, and although some concession is made for the more violent class of men, one should actually completely give up this cruel activity because even a slight discrepancy in animal sacrifices will cause havoc in one’s life.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77763" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It should be understood that those who have become spiritually advanced by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <i>mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺร</span></i> under the guidelines of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu are expected to completely give up material sense gratification. If a devotee of Kṛṣṇa duplicitously tries to take advantage of the scriptural allowances for meat-eating, intoxication or sex enjoyment, then he commits the tenth offense against chanting. Especially if one has accepted the renounced order of life called <i>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsa, - <span style="color:#990012">ตฺริทณฺฑิ-สนฺนฺยาส,</span></i> it is most abominable and reprehensible to become attracted to the Vedic injunctions prescribing regulated sex life for householders. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī there is no such allowance for one in the renounced order of life. The Vaiṣṇava <i>sannyāsīs - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีสฺ</span></i> should not foolishly become bewildered by statements in the Vedic literature such as the following verse from <i>Manu-saṁhitā: - <span style="color:#990012">มนุ-สํหิตา:</span></i></p></div>
    
        <div id="bb77764" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>na māṁsa-bhakṣaṇe doṣo<br />na madye na ca maithune<br />pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ<br />nivṛttis tu mahā-phalā</i></em></div>

</div>    

        <div id="bb77765" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“It may be considered that meat-eating, intoxication and sex indulgence are natural propensities of the conditioned souls, and therefore such persons should not be condemned for these activities. But unless one gives up such sinful activities, there is no possibility of achieving the actual perfection of life.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77766" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the <i>Kriyā-vidhāna - <span style="color:#990012">กฺริยา-วิธาน</span></i> it is explained that sex is permitted only during the <i>vāmadeva - <span style="color:#990012">วามเทว</span></i> sacrifice, or the <i>garbhādhāna-saṁskāra - <span style="color:#990012">ครฺภาธาน-สํสฺการ</span></i> for begetting of religious children. It is also stated that sometimes certain types of meat are used in worshiping Lord Hari through sacrifices to the forefathers and demigods. Similarly, there is a form of intoxication available through drinking the <i>soma - <span style="color:#990012">โสม</span></i> beverage. But if a so-called <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> becomes attracted to such offerings, he immediately becomes polluted. Actually, the <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> who performed such offerings would not personally accept any type of liquor or meat. These things would be consumed by the <i>kṣatriyas, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริยสฺ,</span></i> who were not considered at fault in accepting such remnants of sacrifice.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77767" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>However, in the movement of Caitanya Mahāprabhu it can be observed that those who desire to become advanced devotees of Kṛṣṇa immediately give up all such fruitive sacrifices. There is no scope in pure devotional service for any type of fruitive sacrifices. Caitanya Mahāprabhu demanded that all of His sincere followers engage twenty-four hours a day in <i>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณํ กีรฺตนํ วิโษฺณฮ,</span></i> hearing and chanting the glories of the Personality of Godhead. Those who claim to be followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu and who are seriously planning on going back home, back to Godhead, in the near future should not become mindlessly attracted by Vedic fruitive rituals that are meant to attract those who are hopelessly bound up in the material, bodily concept of life. The followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu always remain aloof from such tainted rituals.</p></div>

Such materialistic householders fear that excessive interest in spiritual life may damage the ambition of their children to acquire false material prestige.

If, however, one whimsically slaughters animals without rigidly following the Vedic prescriptions, such killing is actual violence and should not be accepted by any intelligent person. If the animal sacrifice is perfectly performed, the sacrificed animal immediately goes to the heavenly planets of the demigods and the forefathers. Therefore such a sacrifice is not for killing animals but for demonstrating the potency of Vedic <i>mantras, - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ,</span></i> by the power of which the sacrificed creature is immediately promoted to a higher situation.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77790" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse we can clearly see the great discrepancies in those persons who do not surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His law. As stated in the <i>Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> <i>harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">หราวฺ อภกฺตสฺย กุโต มหทฺ-คุณาฮ:</span></i> those who do not accept the supremacy of the Supreme Lord gradually become infected with the most sinful propensities that bring, in their turn, terrible suffering upon the nondevotees. In the Western countries such as America, many people proudly proclaim themselves to be most pious religionists and sometimes even prophets or representatives of God. Boasting of their religiosity, such foolish people experience no fear or doubt in cruelly slaughtering innumerable animals in slaughterhouses or on hunting trips for their whimsical sense gratification. In the state of Mississippi there are sometimes pig-killing festivals, in which entire families enjoy watching a pig cruelly butchered before their eyes. Similarly, a former president of the United States from Texas did not consider any social occasion complete without the slaughtering of a cow. Such persons mistakenly consider themselves to be perfectly observing the laws of God and due to such arrogant foolishness lose all touch with reality. When a man is raising an animal for slaughter, he feeds the animal nicely and encourages it to grow fat. Thus the animal gradually accepts its would-be killer as its protector and master. When the master finally approaches the helpless animal with a sharp knife or gun, the animal thinks, “Oh, my master is joking with me.” Only at the last minute does the animal understand that the so-called master is death personified. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature that cruel masters who kill innocent animals will undoubtedly be killed in the next life by a similar process.</p></div>

In other words, one who kills an animal or who eats meat undoubtedly acquires a debt to the living entity who has contributed his body for the satisfaction of the meat-eater. The meat-eater must pay his debt by contributing his own body to be consumed in the next life. Such payment of one’s debt by offering one’s own body to be eaten is confirmed in the Vedic literature.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77807" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Those who are completely in the darkness of ignorance and thus bereft even of material pious life commit innumerable sinful activities and suffer greatly. Due to such intense suffering such persons sometimes seek the shelter of the devotees of the Lord and, being blessed by such transcendental association, are sometimes elevated to the highest perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77808" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Those who are not completely sinful experience some mitigation of the miseries of material life and thus develop a false sense of well-being within the material world. Because those who are materially pious generally obtain worldly prosperity, bodily beauty and a pleasant family situation, they become falsely proud of their position and are not inclined to associate with or accept instructions from the devotees of the Lord. Unfortunately, all material activities, whether pious or impious, are inevitably contaminated by sinful activity. Those who are proud of their piety and do not like to hear about Kṛṣṇa sooner or later fall down from their artificial position. Every living entity is an eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, until we surrender to Kṛṣṇa, our position is actually always impious. The word <i>akṣaṇikāḥ - <span style="color:#990012">อกฺษณิกาฮ</span></i> (“not having even a moment to reflect”) is significant in this verse. Materialistic persons cannot spare a single moment for their eternal self-interest. This is a symptom of misfortune. Such persons are considered to be killing their own souls because by their obstinacy they are preparing a dark future for themselves from which they will not escape for a very long time.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77809" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A sick man receiving medical treatment may be encouraged by the preliminary results of the doctor’s care. But if the patient becomes falsely proud of the preliminary progress in his treatment and prematurely gives up the doctor’s orders, thinking himself already cured, there will undoubtedly be a relapse. The words <i>ye kaivalyam asamprāptāḥ - <span style="color:#990012">เย ไกวลฺยมฺ อสมฺปฺราปฺตาฮ</span></i> in this verse clearly indicate that material piety is a long way from perfect knowledge of the Absolute Truth. If one gives up his spiritual progress before achieving the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he will undoubtedly fall back down into the most unpleasant material situation, even if he has achieved impersonal realization of the Brahman effulgence.

        <div id="bb77846" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The sage Karabhājana Muni is replying to Videharāja Nimi’s questions about the varieties of the Lord’s incarnations. In Satya-yuga the Lord’s color is white, and He wears tree bark and a black deerskin as an ideal meditative <i>brahmacārī. - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมจารี.</span></i> Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has explained the Lord’s various names in Satya-yuga as follows. Those who are self-realized know this supreme reality of the Personality of Godhead as Paramātmā. Those souls who are situated in the religious system of <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span></i> glorify Him as the <i>haṁsa - <span style="color:#990012">หํส</span></i> who is transcendental to all the <i>varṇas - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณสฺ</span></i> and <i>āśramas. - <span style="color:#990012">อาศฺรมสฺ.</span></i> Persons absorbed in gross matter consider Him to be Suparṇa, “the beautifully winged” basis of the conceptions of cause and effect who flies within the subtle sky of the soul, as described in <i>Chāndogya Upaniṣad. - <span style="color:#990012">ฉาโนฺทคฺย อุปนิษทฺ.</span></i> Persons accustomed to wandering within this universe of subtle and gross matter created by the Lord’s illusory potency chant His name Vaikuṇṭha. Persons deprived of the power of transcendental meditation (<i>dhāraṇā - <span style="color:#990012">ธารณา</span></i>), who are thus subject to falling from the path of religion, glorify Him as Dharma, or religion personified. Those who are forced to submit to the illusory modes of material nature and whose minds are uncontrolled and disturbed glorify Him as the most perfectly self-controlled Yogeśvara. Persons tainted by a mixture of the modes of passion and ignorance call Him Amala, or the uncontaminated. Persons devoid of potency call Him Īśvara, and those who consider themselves to be under His shelter chant His glories by the name Uttama Puruṣa. Those who know that this material manifestation is only temporary call Him Avyakta. In this way, in Satya-yuga Lord Vāsudeva appears in various four-armed transcendental forms, and the <i>jīva - <span style="color:#990012">ชีว</span></i> souls worship Him, each by their own particular process of devotional service. Therefore the Supreme Lord has many different names.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77871" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When Lord Kṛṣṇa was leaving the city of Hastināpura, Arjuna personally held an umbrella over the Lord, and Uddhava and Sātyaki fanned the Lord with decorated fans (<i>Bhāg. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาคฺ.</span></i> 1.10.17, 18). In this way, Emperor Yudhiṣṭhira and his followers worshiped Kṛṣṇa as the greatest of noble kings and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, at the Rājasūya sacrifice all of the great souls of the universe elected Kṛṣṇa as the King of all kings, the greatest personality, deserving of first worship. Such reverential worship of the Lord is characteristic of Dvāpara-yuga, - <span style="color:#990012">ยุค,</span> as described in this verse (<i>mahā-rājopalakṣaṇam - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ราโชปลกฺษณมฺ</span></i>). With each successive <i>yuga,</i> namely Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, the condition of human society deteriorates more and more. As mentioned in this verse, the only favorable qualification of the residents of Dvāpara-yuga is that they are <i>jijñāsavaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ชิชฺญาสวฮ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชิชฺญาสวฮ,</span></i> strongly desirous of knowing the Absolute Truth. Otherwise there is no good qualification mentioned. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga were described as <i>śāntāḥ, nirvairāḥ, suhṛdaḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ศานฺตาฮ, นิไรฺวราฮ, สุหฺฤทฮ</span></i> and <i>samāḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">สมาฮ,</span></i> or peaceful, free from envy, the well-wishers of every living entity, and fixed on the spiritual platform beyond the modes of material nature. Similarly the inhabitants of Tretā-yuga were described as <i>dharmiṣṭhāḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺมิษฺฐาฮ</span></i> and <i>brahma-vādinaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-วาทินฮ,</span></i> or thoroughly religious, and expert followers of the Vedic injunctions. In the present verse, the inhabitants of Dvāpara-yuga are said to be simply <i>jijñāsavaḥ,</i> desiring to know the Absolute Truth. Otherwise they are described as <i>martyāḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">มรฺตฺยาฮ,</span></i> or subject to the weakness of mortal beings. If the human society of even Dvāpara-yuga was clearly inferior to that of Satya and Tretā-yugas, we can hardly imagine the truly disastrous condition of human society in Kali-yuga. Therefore, as will be mentioned in the following verses, human beings who have taken their birth in the present Age of Kali should attach themselves rigidly to the movement of Caitanya Mahāprabhu to free themselves from foolishness.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77878" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Ordinary living entities, although eternally subordinate to the Lord, become absorbed in attempting to dominate the material creation yet ultimately remain under the control of the Supreme Lord. The constitutional position of the living entity is engagement in the Lord’s service. It is further the constitutional position of the material nature to be engaged by the living entity in satisfying the transcendental desires of the Lord. Thus these prayers, as mentioned in this verse, are offered to the Supreme Lord in accordance with the <i>Pañcarātra - <span style="color:#990012">ปญฺจราตฺร</span></i> and the Vedic <i>mantras - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> so that one may become fixed in remembering his eternal subordination to the Absolute Truth.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77879" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The supreme living entity, Kṛṣṇa, eternally manifests Himself as the <i>catur-vyūha - <span style="color:#990012">จตุรฺ-วฺยูห</span> - <span style="color:#990012">จตุรฺ-วฺยูห</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">จตุรฺ-วฺยูห,</span></i> or quadruple plenary expansion. The purport of this prayer is that one should give up his false ego and pray to this <i>catur-vyūha</i> by offering Them obeisances. Although the Absolute Truth is one without a second, the Absolute Truth displays His unlimited opulences and potencies by expanding Himself in innumerable plenary forms, of which the <i>catur-vyūha</i> is a principal expansion. The original being is Vāsudeva, the Personality of Godhead. When the Godhead manifests His primeval energies and opulences, He is called Saṅkarṣaṇa. Pradyumna is the basis of the Viṣṇu expansion who is the soul of the entire universe, and Aniruddha is the basis of the personal manifestation of Viṣṇu as the Supersoul of every individual entity within the universe. Among the four plenary expansions mentioned here, the original expansion is Vāsudeva, and the other three are considered to be particular manifestations of Him.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77880" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When the living entity forgets that both he himself as well as the material nature are meant for the Lord’s service, the quality of ignorance becomes prominent, and the conditioned entity desires to become himself the master. Thus the conditioned soul imagines that he is a very important person within society or that he is a great philosopher. The Vedic <i>mantras - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> and <i>Pañcarātra - <span style="color:#990012">ปญฺจราตฺร</span></i> give mankind instructions about devotional service to the Personality of Godhead, which free one from the contamination of considering oneself a prestigious member of society or a great philosopher. One in knowledge should recognize himself as a tiny servant of the Supreme Absolute Truth.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77881" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In Dvāpara-yuga, Deity worship of the Lord is prominent. Such Deity worship is ultimately aimed at the process of <i>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณํ กีรฺตนํ วิโษฺณฮ.</span></i> Without hearing and chanting the glories of the Lord one cannot perform Deity worship. In Deity worship it is required that the worshiper glorify the names, forms, qualities, paraphernalia, entourage and pastimes of the Supreme Lord. When such glorification is complete, the worshiper becomes eligible to realize transcendental knowledge through hearing about the Lord.</p></div>

Such standard Vedic processes are practically inaccessible for the spiritually retarded population of Kali-yuga. Therefore the simple process of glorifying the Personality of Godhead by chanting His holy names is essential in this age.

This will be more clearly explained in the following verse.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77894" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This same verse is quoted by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja in the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta, - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต,</span></i> <i>Ādi-līlā, - <span style="color:#990012">อาทิ-ลีลา,</span></i> Chapter Three, verse 52. His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda has given the following commentary on this verse. “This text is from <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (11.5.32). Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained this verse in his commentary on the <i>Bhāgavatam</i> known as the <i>Krama-sandarbha, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺรม-สนฺทรฺภ,</span></i> wherein he says that Lord Kṛṣṇa also appears with a golden complexion. That golden Lord Kṛṣṇa is Lord Caitanya, who is worshiped by intelligent men in this age. That is confirmed in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> by Garga Muni, who said that although the child Kṛṣṇa was blackish, He also appears in three other colors — red, white and yellow. He exhibited His white and red complexions in the Satya and Tretā ages respectively. He did not exhibit the remaining color, yellow-gold, until He appeared as Lord Caitanya, who is known as Gaurahari.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77895" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that <i>kṛṣṇa-varṇam - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-วรฺณมฺ</span></i> means Śrī Kṛṣṇa - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ</span> Caitanya. <i>Kṛṣṇa-varṇam - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-วรฺณมฺ</span></i> and Kṛṣṇa Caitanya are equivalent. The name <i>Kṛṣṇa</i> appears with both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Kṛṣṇa. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He always engages in describing Kṛṣṇa and thus enjoying transcendental bliss by chanting and remembering His name and form. Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself appears as Lord Caitanya to preach the highest gospel. <i>Varṇayati - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณยติ</span></i> means ‘utters’ or ‘describes.’ Lord Caitanya always chants the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and describes it also, and because He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, whoever meets Him will automatically chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and later describe it to others. He injects one with transcendental Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which merges the chanter in transcendental bliss. In all respects, therefore, He appears before everyone as Kṛṣṇa, either by personality or by sound. Simply by seeing Lord Caitanya one at once remembers Lord Kṛṣṇa. One may therefore accept Him as <i>viṣṇu-tattva. - <span style="color:#990012">วิษฺณุ-ตตฺตฺว.</span></i> In other words, Lord Caitanya is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself.</p></div>

His body is always decorated with ornaments of sandalwood and with sandalwood paste. By His superexcellent beauty He subdues all the people of the age. In other descents the Lord sometimes used weapons to defeat the demoniac, but in this age the Lord subdues them with His all-attractive figure as Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī explains that His beauty is His <i>astra, - <span style="color:#990012">อสฺตฺร,</span></i> or weapon, to subdue the demons. Because He is all-attractive, it is to be understood that all the demigods lived with Him as His companions. His acts were uncommon and His associates wonderful. When He propagated the <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement, He attracted many great scholars and <i>ācāryas, - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ,</span></i> especially in Bengal and Orissa. Lord Caitanya is always accompanied by His best associates like Lord Nityānanda, Advaita, Gadādhara and Śrīvāsa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77897" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī cites a verse from the Vedic literature that says that there is no necessity of performing sacrificial demonstrations or ceremonial functions. He comments that instead of engaging in such external, pompous exhibitions, all people, regardless of caste, color or creed, can assemble together and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa to worship Lord Caitanya. <i>Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-วรฺณํ ตฺวิษากฺฤษฺณมฺ</span></i> indicates that prominence should be given to the name Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya taught Kṛṣṇa consciousness and chanted the name of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, to worship Lord Caitanya, everyone should together chant the <i>mahā-mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-มนฺตฺร</span></i> — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. To propagate worship in churches, temples or mosques is not possible because people have lost interest in that. But anywhere and everywhere, people can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thus worshiping Lord Caitanya, they can perform the highest activity and fulfill the highest religious purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77898" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“Śrīla Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, a famous disciple of Lord Caitanya, said: ‘The principle of transcendental devotional service having been lost, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya has appeared to deliver again the process of devotion. He is so kind that He is distributing love of Kṛṣṇa. Everyone should be attracted more and more to His lotus feet, as humming bees are attracted to a lotus flower.’”</p></div>

        <div id="bb77904" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The incarnation of the Personality of Godhead in Kali-yuga is described and worshiped in this verse. The sage Karabhājana, after describing the incarnation of Godhead in each of the three previous <i>yugas - <span style="color:#990012">ยุคสฺ</span></i> — Satya, Tretā and Dvāpara — presented suitable prayers which are utilized for glorifying the Lord in each particular age. After describing the Lord’s manifestation in Kali-yuga with the verse <i>kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-วรฺณํ ตฺวิษากฺฤษฺณมฺ,</span></i> this and the next verse are now presented to glorify the Lord’s appearance in Kali-yuga as Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <i>kṛṣṇa-varṇam. - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-วรฺณมฺ.</span></i> Caitanya Mahāprabhu appears in Kali-yuga and teaches everyone to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. The members of the ISKCON movement are so much absorbed in <i>kṛṣṇa-varṇam, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-วรฺณมฺ,</span></i> or chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa, that sometimes ordinary persons refer to them as “the Kṛṣṇas.” Thus whoever comes into contact with Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s movement immediately begins to worship Kṛṣṇa by chanting His holy name.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77905" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The words <i>dhyeyaṁ sadā - <span style="color:#990012">สทา</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">เธฺยยํ สทา,</span></i> or “always to be meditated upon,” indicate that there are no hard-and-fast rules in this age for chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa. In Kali-yuga the authorized process of meditation is to chant the holy names of the Lord, especially the <i>mantra - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺร</span></i> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This process is to be executed constantly and always (<i>sadā</i>). Similarly, Caitanya Mahāprabhu stated, <i>nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">นามฺนามฺ อการิ พหุธา นิช-สรฺว-ศกฺติสฺ ตตฺรารฺปิตา นิยมิตฮ สฺมรเณ น กาลฮ:</span></i> in Kali-yuga, the Supreme Lord has kindly invested all of His potencies in His holy name, and there are no hard-and-fast rules for chanting such names. The mention of such rules refers to <i>kāla-deśa-niyama, - <span style="color:#990012">กาล-เทศ-นิยม,</span></i> or regulations of time and place. Normally there are strict regulations governing the time, season, place, conditions, etc., under which one may execute a particular Vedic ceremony or chant a particular <i>mantra. - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺร.</span></i> However, one should chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa everywhere and at all times, twenty-four hours a day. Thus there is no restriction in terms of time and place. This is the meaning of Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s statement.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77906" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>paribhava-ghnam - <span style="color:#990012">ปริภว-ฆฺนมฺ</span></i> is significant in this verse. In Kali-yuga human society is infected with enviousness. There is great envy, even among members of the same family, who constantly quarrel in this age. Similarly, neighbors are envious of each other and of each other’s possessions and status. And entire nations, burning with envy, go to war unnecessarily at the risk of genocide caused by terrible modern weapons. But all of these harassments caused by family members, strangers, so-called friends who are unfaithful, opposing nations, financial competition, social disgrace, cancer, etc., can be relieved by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is not possible to save the material body, but one who takes shelter of Caitanya Mahāprabhu loosens the hard knot of the heart that psychologically binds him to the hallucination of identifying with the external body or the subtle material mind. Once this false identification is broken, one can be blissful in any adverse material condition. Those who foolishly try to make the temporary body eternal are wasting their time and neglecting the actual process for making life permanent, which is to take shelter of the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77907" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse the word <i>tīrthāspadam - <span style="color:#990012">ตีรฺตฺหาสฺปทมฺ</span></i> means that the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu are the shelter of all holy places. As the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement spreads all over the world, we often find, especially in poor third-world countries, that it is very difficult for people to travel to India to visit the most exalted holy places such as Vṛndāvana and Māyāpur. Especially in South America it is very difficult for a large number of devotees to visit such places in India and purify themselves. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so merciful that simply by worshiping Him, Vaiṣṇavas throughout the world receive the benefit of having visited the supreme holy place, namely the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus there is no loss for the followers of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, despite their external situation.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77908" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this regard, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has stated, <i>kalau dravya-deśa-kriyādi-janitaṁ durvāram apāvitryam api nāśaṅkanīyam iti bhāvaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">กละอุ ทฺรวฺย-เทศ-กฺริยาทิ-ชนิตํ ทุรฺวารมฺ อปาวิตฺรฺยมฺ อปิ นาศงฺกนียมฺ อิติ ภาวฮ.</span></i> In this age the world is so polluted by sinful life that it is very difficult to become free from all of the symptoms of Kali-yuga. Still, one who is faithfully serving in the missionary work of Caitanya Mahāprabhu need not fear occasional, unavoidable symptoms of Kali-yuga. The followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu strictly follow the four regulative principles of no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating and no gambling. They try to always chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and engage in the service of the Lord. However, it may happen that by accident an occasional symptom of Kali-yuga such as envy, anger, lust, greed, etc., may momentarily appear in the life of a devotee. But if such a devotee is actually surrendered at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by His mercy such an unwanted symptom, or <i>anartha, - <span style="color:#990012">อนรฺตฺห,</span></i> will quickly disappear. Therefore, a sincere follower of the Lord should never be discouraged in the execution of his prescribed duty but should be confident that he will be protected by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</p></div>

This verse does not mention that one need be an exalted devotee of the Lord. Rather, it is stated that if one simply bows down at the Lord’s lotus feet he will get all protection, and this also applies to anyone who is trying to serve the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Thus the devotee is not worried about his future destination, for he is confident that the Lord will quickly take him across the ocean of material existence. Such confidence is referred to in the <i>Upadeśāmṛta - <span style="color:#990012">อุปเทศามฺฤต</span></i> by the word <i>niścayāt, - <span style="color:#990012">นิศฺจยาตฺ,</span></i> meaning firm conviction about the potency of the process of devotional service. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the statement <i>śiva-viriñci-nutam - <span style="color:#990012">ศิว-วิริญฺจิ-นุตมฺ</span></i> is also understood to indicate that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is worshiped by Lord Śiva’s incarnation Advaita Ācārya and by Lord Brahmā’s incarnation Haridāsa Ṭhākura.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77912" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Caitanya Mahāprabhu - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรภุ</span> is addressed in this verse as <i>mahā-puruṣa - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ปุรุษ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ปุรุษ,</span></i> meaning <i>puruṣottama, - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุโษตฺตม,</span></i> the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, there is reference to <i>mahāprabhu - <span style="color:#990012">มหาปฺรภุ</span></i> in the <i>Śvetāśvatara - <span style="color:#990012">เศฺวตาศฺวตร</span></i> <i>Upaniṣad - <span style="color:#990012">อุปนิษทฺ</span></i> (3.12), <i>mahān prabhur vai puruṣaḥ sattvasyaiṣa pravartakaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">มหานฺ ปฺรภุรฺ ไว ปุรุษฮ สตฺตฺวไสฺยษ ปฺรวรฺตกฮ:</span></i> “The supreme <i>prabhu</i> is the Personality of Godhead, who is the initiator of the entire cosmos.” Similarly, Lord Śrī Gaurakṛṣṇa is addressed by the word <i>mahā-puruṣa</i> in this verse, and the whole intention of this verse is to offer obeisances at His lotus feet. Such lotus feet are the actual eternal object of meditation because they cut off the bondage of material life and fulfill the desires of the devotees. Although the conditioned souls laboring arduously under illusion pursue many temporary goals in life, there is no possibility of their achieving actual bliss or knowledge. Such eternal bliss and knowledge is actually wealth. One should not neglect the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, taking Him to be an ordinary person, and instead accept the temporary, useless shelter offered by the illusory energy of the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77913" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Those <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> who falsely select some other object of meditation besides the lotus feet of the Lord are simply creating obstructions to their own eternal life. When the meditator, the meditation and the object of meditation are all on the eternal platform of the Lord, then actual shelter has been achieved. Generally the conditioned souls are engaged in <i>bhoga-tyāga. - <span style="color:#990012">โภค-ตฺยาค.</span></i> Sometimes they run madly after material prestige and sense gratification, and sometimes they desperately try to renounce these things. However, beyond this vicious cycle of alternating sense gratification and renunciation are the lotus feet of the Lord, which constitute the ultimate abode of peace and happiness for the living entity.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77924" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to the Vaiṣṇava <i>ācāryas, - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ,</span></i> this important verse of the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> is understood to describe Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Kṛṣṇa and also Lord Śrī Rāmacandra. This verse appears within the discussion by the sage Karabhājana of the <i>yugāvatāras, - <span style="color:#990012">ยุคาวตารสฺ,</span></i> or the different incarnations of the Personality of Godhead who deliver the conditioned souls of each age. The prayers ending with the words <i>vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam - <span style="color:#990012">วเนฺท มหา-ปุรุษ เต จรณารวินฺทมฺ</span></i> are understood to glorify the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa in Kali-yuga known as Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived for twenty-four years in Navadvīpa as a householder and enjoyed immense popularity among both scholars and ordinary persons. His <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement was completely supported by the local government, even though it was Muslim. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu had the pleasure of marrying the goddess of fortune. No ordinary woman of the material world, no matter how gorgeous she may be, can in any way compare with the beautiful goddess of fortune. Everyone in the universe, including Lord Brahmā, is searching after the goddess of fortune. Therefore it is stated here, <i>surepsita. - <span style="color:#990012">สุเรปฺสิต.</span></i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77925" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>However, Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Lord Kṛṣṇa appearing as a <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span></i> and therefore He is certainly <i>dharmiṣṭhaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺมิษฺฐฮ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺมิษฺฐฮ,</span></i> or the most religious. Actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always <i>dharmiṣṭhaḥ,</i> whether He appears as a cowherd boy, a great king or a <i>brāhmaṇa,</i> because the Lord Himself is the original source and personification of all religious principles. However, in the pastimes of Caitanya Mahāprabhu there are very few political or economic activities. Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared as a great philosopher-<i>brāhmaṇa,</i> and thus He is certainly <i>dharmiṣṭhaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺมิษฺฐฮ.</span></i> In <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta, - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต,</span></i> in the Seventeenth Chapter of the <i>Ādi-līlā, - <span style="color:#990012">อาทิ-ลีลา,</span></i> it is described that a certain <i>brāhmaṇa,</i> who was well known for being harsh and cursing others, could not enter the <i>kīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตน</span></i> hall where Caitanya Mahāprabhu was performing <i>kīrtana</i> because the door was locked. Being very agitated and breaking his <i>brāhmaṇa’s - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ′สฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ′สฺ</span></i> thread, he cursed Caitanya Mahāprabhu the next day on the bank of the Ganges, saying, “I shall now curse You, for Your behavior has greatly aggrieved me. You shall be bereft of all material happiness.” However, Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt great jubilation within Himself, since His mission was <i>vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ไวราคฺย-วิทฺยา-นิช-ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> — to give up the illusion of material sense gratification and staunchly engage twenty-four hours a day in the devotional service of the Lord. Therefore, Caitanya Mahāprabhu took this curse as a blessing, and soon after, the Lord took <i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส.</span></i> Thus it is stated in this verse that by the words of the Āryan, the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> (<i>ārya-vacasā - <span style="color:#990012">อารฺย-วจสา</span></i>), Caitanya Mahāprabhu took <i>sannyāsa</i> (<i>yad agād araṇyam - <span style="color:#990012">ยทฺ อคาทฺ อรณฺยมฺ</span></i>) and went traveling through the different forests of India on the way to Vṛndāvana, and later South India. Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted especially to preserve the prestige of the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> class, and therefore He decided to keep the <i>brāhmaṇa’s</i> curse intact.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77926" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has explained the word <i>māyā-mṛgam - <span style="color:#990012">มายา-มฺฤคมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤคมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มายา-มฺฤคมฺ</span></i> as follows. <i>Māyā - <span style="color:#990012">มายา</span></i> means one’s so-called wife, children and bank account, which keep one firmly bound up in the material bodily concept of life. The word <i>mṛgam</i> indicates <i>mṛgyati, - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤคฺยติ,</span></i> or “to search out.” Thus, <i>māyā-mṛgam</i> indicates the conditioned living entity, who is always frantically searching for the latest up-to-the-minute sense gratification in the material bodily concept of society, friendship and love. <i>Anvadhāvat - <span style="color:#990012">อนฺวธาวตฺ</span></i> indicates that Caitanya Mahāprabhu was always visibly going here and there, searching after the fallen conditioned souls. Caitanya Mahāprabhu would sometimes embrace the conditioned souls on the pretext of religious friendship or ecstasy. But actually, the Lord was touching the bodies of the conditioned souls to pull them out of the ocean of material existence and hurl them into the ocean of ecstatic love of Godhead. Thus Caitanya Mahāprabhu was the most merciful and munificent incarnation of the Lord, whose mercy surpassed the bounds of mundane discrimination in the matter of caste, color and creed.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77927" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>dayitayā - <span style="color:#990012">ทยิตยา</span></i> can be explained as follows. The Sanskrit word <i>dayā - <span style="color:#990012">ทยา</span></i> means “mercy.” Thus, by grammatical derivation, the word used in this verse, <i>dayitayā, - <span style="color:#990012">ทยิตยา,</span></i> indicates that because of being the most merciful, Caitanya Mahāprabhu was busily engaged in rescuing the fallen conditioned souls, who are completely distracted and bewildered by the external illusory energy of the Lord. The quality of being the most merciful is part and parcel of the character of the <i>mahā-puruṣa, - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ปุรุษ,</span></i> or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77928" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, this verse also describes the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself in His original blackish form. Thus the words <i>surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīm - <span style="color:#990012">สุเรปฺสิต-ราชฺย-ลกฺษฺมีมฺ</span></i> indicate <i>śrī-mathurā-sampattim, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรี-มตฺหุรา-สมฺปตฺติมฺ,</span></i> or the opulence of Mathurā. Mathurā is described in Vedic literature as the reservoir of all opulence because of the touch of the Lord’s lotus feet in that precinct. But Kṛṣṇa, although taking birth in the opulent city of Mathurā, transferred Himself to the forest village of Vṛndāvana. In this case the word <i>ārya-vacasā - <span style="color:#990012">อารฺย-วจสา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อารฺย-วจสา</span></i> indicates the order of Lord Kṛṣṇa’s original parents, Vasudeva and Devakī. In <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (10.3.22, 29) both Vasudeva and Devakī express their fear at the threat of Kaṁsa, who had already killed all of Kṛṣṇa’s elder brothers. The word <i>ārya-vacasā</i> thus indicates that with great love they requested Kṛṣṇa to kindly make some arrangement to avoid Kaṁsa. And Kṛṣṇa, to obey their order, transferred Himself to the forest village of Vṛndāvana (<i>yad agād araṇyam - <span style="color:#990012">ยทฺ อคาทฺ อรณฺยมฺ</span></i>).</p></div>

Due to the inconceivable love of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, Lord Kṛṣṇa becomes easily controlled by Her. Thus, <i>mṛgam, - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤคมฺ,</span></i> or “animal,” in this case indicates <i>krīḍā-mṛgam, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺรีฑา-มฺฤคมฺ,</span></i> or “a toy animal.” Just as a beautiful young girl may play with so many dolls or stuffed animals, similarly Lord Kṛṣṇa becomes just like a doll in the hands of the most beautiful young girl, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī performed innumerable types of worship in order to bind Kṛṣṇa more and more to Her because Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī cannot live without Kṛṣṇa. Thus, due to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī’s <i>ārādhana, - <span style="color:#990012">อาราธน,</span></i> or worship, Kṛṣṇa can never leave Vṛndāvana. He runs here and there in Vṛndāvana, protecting the cows, playing with His friends and engaging in countless intrigues of love with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the <i>gopīs. - <span style="color:#990012">โคปีสฺ.</span></i> Thus the word <i>anvadhāvat - <span style="color:#990012">อนฺวธาวตฺ</span></i> indicates Kṛṣṇa’s boyish activities, His running throughout the transcendental land of Vṛndāvana, tightly under the control of the love of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.</p></div>

Although the Lord is completely independent and detached from everything, He becomes attached to His pure devotees due to their love for Him. In the great capital of Ayodhyā all of the citizens loved Rāmacandra more than can be described. In this context <i>ārya-vacasā - <span style="color:#990012">อารฺย-วจสา</span></i> means that by the order of His father, who was just like His <i>guru, - <span style="color:#990012">คุรุ,</span></i> Rāmacandra gave up everything and went to the forest.

There is a strong tendency toward imitation and fraud in this age. Therefore the incarnation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is revealed in Vedic literature in a confidential, discrete way, so that it will be known to the authorized persons who can then propagate the mission of the Lord on the earth. We actually see in this modern age that many foolish and ordinary persons claim to be God or incarnations, <i>avatāras, - <span style="color:#990012">อวตารสฺ,</span></i> etc. There are many cheap philosophies and academies that promise, for a moderate fee, to make one God in a short time. In America one famous religious group promises its followers that they will all become the Supreme Lord in heaven. Such bogus preaching goes on in the name of Christianity. Thus, were Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s name widely spoken of in Vedic literature, there would soon be a veritable plague of imitation Caitanya Mahāprabhus infesting the world.</p></div>

In other words, although the king or president of a country is ultimately the controller of the prison department, the king or president derives actual pleasure within his own palace and not in administering justice to the foolish prisoners. Similarly, the Lord appoints the demigods to administer the material creation on His behalf while He Himself personally enjoys the ocean of transcendental bliss in His own transcendental kingdom. Thus, realization of the Lord within His own kingdom is far superior to the primitive understanding that the Lord is the “creator” of the prison of the material world. This realization of Bhagavān begins with understanding that there are innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets in the spiritual sky and that on each of them a particular expansion of Nārāyaṇa dwells with His innumerable devotees who are attached to that particular form. The central and chief planet in the spiritual sky is called Kṛṣṇaloka, and there the Personality of Godhead exhibits His supreme and original form of Govinda. As confirmed by Lord Brahmā, <i>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi. - <span style="color:#990012">โควินฺทมฺ อาทิ-ปุรุษํ ตมฺ อหํ ภชามิ.</span></i> Lord Brahmā also states:</p></div>

        <div id="bb77956" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Thus, love of Kṛṣṇa and entrance into Kṛṣṇa’s planet in the spiritual sky is the most supremely perfect and exalted status of life available anywhere, at any time, throughout the totality of existence. That perfection is available in Kali-yuga simply by chanting the holy names of God: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Therefore every sane man, woman or child should deeply understand the unprecedented opportunity offered by Caitanya Mahāprabhu and seriously take up this chanting process. Only the most unfortunate and irrational person will neglect this transcendental opportunity.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77961" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the <i>Skanda Purāṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">สฺกนฺท ปุราณ,</span></i> as well as in other <i>Purāṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">ปุราณสฺ,</span></i> there is the following statement: <i>mahā-bhāgavatā nityaṁ kalau kurvanti kīrtanam. - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ภาควตา นิตฺยํ กละอุ กุรฺวนฺติ กีรฺตนมฺ.</span></i> “During Kali-yuga the great devotees of the Lord always engage in <i>kīrtana, - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตน,</span></i> chanting the Lord’s holy names.” It is the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be merciful, and He is especially merciful to those who, in a helpless condition, take complete shelter of His lotus feet. One can immediately take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord by chanting His holy names. According to Śrīdhara Svāmī, even in previous ages such as Satya-yuga it was not possible for the living entities to achieve the perfection that is available in Kali-yuga. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained this as follows. In former ages such as Satya-yuga human beings were perfectly qualified and easily performed even the most difficult spiritual processes, meditating for many thousands of years practically without eating or sleeping. Thus, although in any age one who completely takes shelter of the Lord’s holy name gets all perfection, the highly qualified inhabitants of Satya-yuga do not consider that merely moving the tongue and lips, chanting the Lord’s holy name, is a complete process and that the Lord’s holy name is the only shelter within the universe. They are more attracted to the difficult and elaborate <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> system of meditation, complete with sophisticated sitting postures, painstaking control of the breath and deep, extended meditations in trance on the Personality of Godhead within the heart. In Satya-yuga sinful life is practically unheard of, and therefore people are not afflicted with the terrible reactions seen in Kali-yuga, such as world war, famine, plague, drought, insanity, etc. Although in Satya-yuga people always worship the Personality of Godhead as the ultimate goal of life and meticulously follow His laws, called <i>dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม,</span></i> they do not feel themselves to be in a helpless condition, and thus they do not always experience intense love for the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77962" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>However, in Kali-yuga living conditions are so unbearable, modern governments are so obnoxious, our bodies are so ridden by physical and mental disease, and even self-preservation is so troublesome, that the conditioned souls intensely cry out the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, begging for relief from the onslaught of this age. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have vivid and unforgettable experiences of the terrible contradictions inherent in human society in this age, and thus they are firmly convinced that there is nothing to be achieved except the mercy of the Supreme Lord. In ISKCON centers throughout the world we observe wonderfully ecstatic <i>kīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตน</span></i> performances in which men, women and children from all walks of life chant with startling enthusiasm the holy names of Kṛṣṇa and dance in ecstasy, becoming completely indifferent to so-called public opinion. In America a prominent professor from Oberlin College visited a Hare Kṛṣṇa center in California and was astonished by the enthusiasm with which the devotees chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa in their congregational performances.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77963" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Thus, due to their helpless and pathetic condition, the living entities in Kali-yuga have great impetus to surrender fully to the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, putting all of their hope and faith in the Lord’s holy name. Kali-yuga is therefore the best age because in this age, more than in Satya-yuga or other ages, the conditioned souls become disgusted with the kingdom of illusion and surrender fully to the Lord’s holy name. This status of full surrender is called <i>paramāṁ śāntim, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมาํ ศานฺติมฺ,</span></i> or supreme peace.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77964" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīla Madhvācārya has quoted a passage from the book called <i>Svābhāvya - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวาภาวฺย</span></i> to the effect that a bona fide spiritual master in disciplic succession is able to understand the mentality and capability of his disciples and engage them in worshiping the particular form of the Lord suitable for them. In this way the spiritual master destroys all obstacles in the path of his disciples. The general rule is that one must worship the particular form of the Lord that appears in the current <i>yuga. - <span style="color:#990012">ยุค.</span></i> One may also offer his love and worship to other forms of the Lord that appear in other ages, and specifically one is recommended to chant the holy names of Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva to get all protection. Practically all of these injunctions are being carried out within the ISKCON movement. Within the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, men, women and children are all being engaged in worshiping the Lord according to their particular natures. In addition, according to Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s order, we are worshiping Balarāma and Kṛṣṇa, who appeared in Dvāpara-yuga, because They are the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, by chanting the <i>Daśāvatāra-stotra, jaya jagad-īśa hare, - <span style="color:#990012">ทศาวตาร-โสฺตตฺร, ชย ชคทฺ-อีศ หเร,</span></i> and by reading <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> the members of ISKCON worship all of the plenary expansions of the Personality of Godhead. And after every <i>ārati - <span style="color:#990012">อารติ</span></i> performance devotional prayers are duly chanted to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva for protection of this movement, which is so essential to human society.</p></div>

        <div id="bb77971" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> contain information of past, present and future living conditions throughout the universe. This is not very wonderful. For example, although at present time in India we are experiencing spring weather, we know that in the future the torrid summer will come, followed by the rainy season, autumn and eventually winter and a new spring. Similarly, we know that these seasons have occurred repeatedly in the past. Thus, just as ordinary human beings can understand the past, present and future seasons of the earth, the liberated followers of Vedic culture can easily understand the past, present and future conditions of the seasonal ages of the earth and other planets. The inhabitants of Satya-yuga are certainly aware of the conditions of Kali-yuga. They know that in Kali-yuga the difficult material situation forces the living entity to take complete shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that the inhabitants of Kali-yuga therefore develop a high degree of love of Godhead. Therefore although the inhabitants of Satya-yuga are far more sinless, truthful and self-controlled than the people of other ages, they desire to take birth in Kali-yuga in order to taste pure love of Kṛṣṇa.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb77972" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Without associating with the devotees of the Lord no one can become an advanced devotee of the Lord. Therefore, since in Kali-yuga other Vedic processes collapse due to the unfavorable condition, and since the only authorized Vedic process is the devotional chanting of the Lord’s holy name, which is available to everyone, there will undoubtedly be innumerable Vaiṣṇavas, or devotees of the Lord, in this age. Birth in this age is very favorable for one who is eager to associate with the devotees. In fact, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is establishing authorized Vaiṣṇava temples throughout the world so that in innumerable areas one may avail himself of association with pure Vaiṣṇavas.</p></div>

One who is performing worship of the Kṛṣṇa Deity should know that the most essential part of such Deity worship is constant chanting of the holy names of the Lord.

The word <i>prāyaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรายฮ,</span></i> or “in general,” indicates that those who are offensive to the Lord’s devotees, although claiming themselves to be devotees, are not included within the list of <i>amalāśayāḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">อมลาศยาฮ,</span></i> or purehearted souls. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura has pointed out that one should not be bewildered by seeing the apparently poverty-stricken condition of the inhabitants of South India. Even nowadays the inhabitants of the places mentioned in this verse generally spend their days with meager eating and clothing and live as great renounced devotees of the Supreme Lord. In other words, clothes do not make the man. To live as a polished animal, dressing oneself luxuriously and gratifying the tongue with rich foodstuffs, is not the actual symptom of an advanced transcendentalist. Although the residents of South India are generally Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, or devotees in the Lakṣmī <i>sampradāya, - <span style="color:#990012">สมฺปฺรทาย,</span></i> they are recognized as devotees of the Lord by the followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, their austere living conditions should be taken as a good qualification, not a disqualification.</p></div>

        <div id="bb78007" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>One who has not fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Lord undoubtedly has many material duties to perform. Every ordinary conditioned soul is the recipient of innumerable benefits given by the demigods, who provide sun and moonshine, rain, wind, food and, ultimately, one’s own material body. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> it is stated, <i>stena eva saḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">เสฺตน เอว สฮ:</span></i> one who does not reciprocate with the demigods by offering them sacrifice is <i>stena, - <span style="color:#990012">เสฺตน,</span></i> or a thief. Similarly, other living entities such as cows are providing us with innumerable delicious and nutritious foodstuffs. When we wake up in the morning our mind is refreshed by the sweet singing of birds, and on a hot day we enjoy the cool shade and breeze of the forest trees. We are accepting service from innumerable living entities, and we are obligated to repay them. <i>Āpta - <span style="color:#990012">อาปฺต</span></i> means one’s own family members, to whom one is certainly obligated according to normal morality, and <i>nṛṇām - <span style="color:#990012">นฺฤณามฺ</span></i> means human society. Until one becomes a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one is certainly a product of his society. We receive mundane education, culture, tradition and protection from the society in which we live, and thus we owe a great debt to society. Of course, our debt to society is not simply to the present order but to all of our forefathers and ancestors who carefully preserved moral and social customs so that we, their descendants, could live peacefully. Therefore the word <i>pitṝṇām, - <span style="color:#990012">ปิตฺฤๅณามฺ,</span></i> or “forefathers,” indicates our debt to previous generations.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78008" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In fact, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society are sometimes criticized by materialistic persons for giving too much attention to Kṛṣṇa rather than working to fulfill all of the above-mentioned obligations. In reply to this, the <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (4.31.14) states, <i>yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ยตฺหา ตโรรฺ มูล-นิเษจเนน ตฺฤปฺยนฺติ ตตฺ-สฺกนฺธ-ภุโชปศาขาฮ.</span></i> If one waters the root of a tree, automatically all of the branches, twigs, leaves, etc., are also nourished. There is no need for, nor any effectiveness in, separately pouring water on the branches, twigs and leaves of a tree. The water has to be placed on the root. Similarly, <i>prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇām: - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺราโณปหาราจฺ จ ยเตฺหนฺทฺริยาณามฺ:</span></i> food must be placed in the stomach, from where it is automatically distributed to all of the limbs of the body. It is foolish to try to nourish the whole body by rubbing food separately on all the bodily limbs. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the source of all existence. Everything is emanating from Kṛṣṇa, everything is maintained by Kṛṣṇa, and at the end, everything will merge to rest in Kṛṣṇa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme benefactor, friend, protector and well-wisher of every living entity, and if He is satisfied, then automatically the whole world will become satisfied, just as all of the bodily limbs are strengthened and satisfied when food is duly remitted to the stomach.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78009" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The example can be given that a man who is working as the personal secretary to a great king has no further obligation to petty minor kings. Undoubtedly an ordinary person has many obligations within this material world. But according to <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> <i>mayaiva vihitān hi tān: - <span style="color:#990012">มไยว วิหิตานฺ หิ ตานฺ:</span></i> it is actually the Supreme Lord who is giving all benedictions. For example, one receives one’s body by the mercy of one’s parents. However, sometimes we find that a particular man or woman may become impotent at a given moment. Sometimes a deformed child is born, and sometimes a child is born dead. Often the sexual act fails to produce pregnancy at all. So although all parents desire a beautiful, highly qualified child, this is often not the case. Thus it can be understood that ultimately it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that a man and woman are able to produce a child by the sexual act. It is by the Lord’s mercy that the man’s seminal injection is potent and the woman’s ovum is fertile. Similarly, it is only by the mercy of the Lord that the child is born in a healthy condition and reaches physical maturity to pursue his own life. If at any stage in the evolution of a human being the Lord’s mercy is withdrawn, sudden death or crippling disease occurs.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78010" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The demigods are also not independent. The words <i>parihṛtya kartam, - <span style="color:#990012">ปริหฺฤตฺย กรฺตมฺ,</span></i> “giving up other duties,” indicate that one should give up any concept that the demigods are separate from Kṛṣṇa. It is clearly stated in Vedic literature that the demigods are different limbs of the universal body of the Supreme Lord. Further, it is stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that the Supreme Lord is situated in everyone’s heart and that He only is giving intelligence and memory. Thus, our forefathers who carefully preserved cultural traditions were acting with intelligence provided by the Supreme Lord. They certainly were not acting with their own independent intelligence. No one can be intelligent without a brain, and it is only by Kṛṣṇa’s mercy that we receive a human brain. Therefore, if we carefully analyze all of our multifarious obligations toward different classes of living entities, we shall find that in each and every case it is ultimately by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that we have received a particular benediction in life. So although an ordinary person must methodically fulfill all of his various obligations by executing different types of sacrifices and charitable activities for the satisfaction of those who have benefited him, one who is directly serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, at once fulfills all such obligations because all benedictions ultimately have come from the Lord through the agency of family, forefathers, demigods, etc.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78011" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The example may be given that sometimes a state government may distribute benefits originally provided by the federal government. So one who becomes the personal secretary or minister to the chief executive of the federal government has no further obligation to the less important representatives of the state government. Therefore, it is stated in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (11.20.9):</p></div>

        <div id="bb78013" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“As long as one is not satiated by fruitive activity and has not awakened his taste for devotional service by hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord, one has to act according to the regulative principles of the Vedic injunctions.” The conclusion is that one who has fully surrendered to the devotional service of the Supreme Lord is a first-class human being.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78014" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>People in general are only eager to receive benedictions from demigods, family members and society because such benedictions are conducive to material sense gratification. Less intelligent persons consider such material progress to be the only goal of life and thus cannot appreciate the exalted position of pure devotional service to the Lord. <i>Bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> or pure devotional service, is meant to directly please the senses of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Envious materialistic persons propose various arguments to deny that the Supreme Lord even has transcendental senses. The devotees, however, do not waste time doubting the inconceivable beauty, strength, wealth and geniality of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but directly please the Lord’s senses through loving service and thus receive the supreme benediction of going back home, back to Godhead. The devotees return to the Lord’s abode, where life is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge. No demigod, family member or forefather can give one an eternal life of bliss and knowledge. However, if one foolishly neglects the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord and instead accepts the temporary material body to be everything, then one must certainly perform elaborate sacrifices, austerities and charity and fulfill all of the obligations mentioned above. Otherwise, one becomes completely sinful and condemned, even from the material point of view.</p></div>

        <div id="bb78019" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous verse it was clearly described that a fully surrendered devotee of the Supreme Lord has no need to perform ordinary, worldly duties. Now in this verse it is revealed that devotional service is so pure and potent that a surrendered devotee of the Lord has no need to perform any other purificatory process. As described in the Sixth Canto of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> a surrendered devotee has no need to perform <i>prāyaścitta, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรายศฺจิตฺต,</span></i> or atonement for an accidental falldown into sinful activity. Since devotional service is itself the most purifying process, a sincere devotee who has accidentally stumbled on the path should immediately resume his pure devotional service at the lotus feet of the Lord. And thus the Lord will protect him, as stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.30):</p></div>
    
        <div id="bb78020" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>api cet su-durācāro<br />bhajate mām ananya-bhāk<br />sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ<br />samyag vyavasito hi saḥ</i></em></div>

        <div id="bb78021" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>tyaktānya-bhāvasya - <span style="color:#990012">ตฺยกฺตานฺย-ภาวสฺย</span></i> in this verse is very significant. As stated in the previous verse, a pure devotee realizes clearly that all living entities, including Brahmā and Śiva, are part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus have no separate or independent existence. Realizing that everything and everyone is part and parcel of the Lord, a devotee automatically is not inclined to commit sinful activities by violating the order of God. However, due to the powerful influence of material nature, even a sincere devotee may be temporarily overwhelmed by illusion and deviate from the rigid path of pure devotional service. In such a case, Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, acting within the heart, removes such sinful activities. Even Yamarāja, the lord of death, has no power to punish a surrendered devotee who has accidentally committed sinful activities. As stated here, Kṛṣṇa is <i>pareśa, - <span style="color:#990012">ปเรศ,</span></i> or the Supreme Lord, and all secondary lords such as the demigods cannot threaten the Lord’s personal devotees. In his youth Ajāmila had been a pious <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> engaged in the service of the Lord. Then, by bad association with a prostitute, he became practically the most degraded man in the world. At the end of his life, Yamarāja sent his Yamadūtas to drag away the soul of the sinful Ajāmila, but the Personality of Godhead immediately sent His personal associates to save Ajāmila and demonstrate to Yamarāja that no secondary personality can disturb the personal devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> <i>kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati. - <span style="color:#990012">กะเอุนฺตย ปฺรติชานีหิ น เม ภกฺตฮ ปฺรณศฺยติ.</span></i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78022" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The argument may be raised that the <i>smṛti-śāstra - <span style="color:#990012">สฺมฺฤติ-ศาสฺตฺร</span></i> states, <i>śruti-smṛtī mamaivājñe: - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรุติ-สฺมฺฤตี มไมวเาชฺญ:</span></i> the Vedic scriptures are the direct orders of the Personality of Godhead. Therefore, one may ask, how can the Lord tolerate that His orders be occasionally neglected, even by His devotees? To answer this possible objection, the word <i>priyasya - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺริยสฺย</span></i> is used in this verse. The devotees of the Lord are very dear to the Lord. Although the beloved child may accidentally commit an abominable activity, the loving father forgives the child, taking into consideration the actual good intentions of the child. Thus, although the devotee of the Lord does not try to exploit the Lord’s mercy by requesting the Lord to free him from any future suffering, the Lord, by His own initiative, frees the devotee from the reactions to accidental falldowns.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78023" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This causeless mercy of the Lord upon His devotee is His <i>paramaiśvaryam, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรไมศฺวรฺยมฺ,</span></i> or supreme opulence. Gradually the faithful devotee becomes free, even from accidental falldown, because simply by remembering the lotus feet of the Lord, what to speak of by actively rendering service to Him, his heart is purified. Although the surrendered devotees of the Personality of Godhead may sometimes appear to be affected by mundane attitudes, they are inevitably protected by the merciful Lord and are never actually defeated in life.</p></div>

Now Nārada reveals that Vasudeva himself will also achieve the supreme perfection of life by practicing the same principles spoken long ago by the nine Yogendras. Actually, Vasudeva was already a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, but due to his natural humility as a great devotee, he was determined to perfect his love of Kṛṣṇa. Thus we can observe the exalted status of the parents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>

Such an attitude is not the perfection of love of Godhead, because when a son is young he is incapable of giving much service to his mother and father. When the child is very young, it is rather the parents who are constantly serving the child. So when the devotee takes the role of mother or father of Kṛṣṇa, there is unlimited opportunity for rendering loving service to the Lord, whom the devotee ecstatically accepts as his son. It was Vasudeva’s good fortune that Nārada Muni personally revealed to him the wonderful teachings given by the <i>nava-yogendras - <span style="color:#990012">นว-โยเคนฺทฺรสฺ</span></i> long, long ago to the saintly King Nimi.</p></div>

Ordinary conditioned souls are required to purify their existence by practicing the regulative principles of <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> and learning how to offer all of their activities in the devotional service of the Lord. Such a regulative, gradual process, however, cannot be applied to those exalted souls who are personally attending the Lord as His parents, boyfriends, girlfriends, advisors, sons, etc. Due to Vasudeva and Devakī’s intense love for Kṛṣṇa as their son, they had already achieved the highest perfectional stage of life. Although in the previous verse Śrī Nārada Muni informed Vasudeva that he and his wife had become glorious by Kṛṣṇa’s taking birth as their son, Vasudeva might have argued that other personal associates of the Lord, such as Jaya and Vijaya, had fallen down due to offending the <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> class. Therefore, in the present verse Nārada has used the word <i>pāvitaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ปาวิตฮ:</span></i> “You are completely purified, and therefore you are completely free from the slightest trace of discrepancy in your devotional service, due to your intense love for Kṛṣṇa.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78049" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is understood from the commentary of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura that Śrī Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa’s pastime father, is actually an eternally liberated <i>nitya-siddha - <span style="color:#990012">นิตฺย-สิทฺธ</span></i> associate of the Personality of Godhead. Vasudeva has a spiritual body, just as Kṛṣṇa does, and he is always merged in the overwhelming ecstatic desire to serve Kṛṣṇa, his beautiful son. However, Nārada could understand that due to extreme humility, Vasudeva considered himself an ordinary human being and was feeling very anxious to receive transcendental instructions on the devotional service of the Lord. Accepting the ecstatic humility of Vasudeva, and to relieve his anxiety, Śrī Nārada Muni instructed him in the science of <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> as one might instruct an ordinary human being. However, at the same time Nārada has revealed that actually Śrī Vasudeva and Devakī are already completely glorious by their unprecedented fortune of having Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma as their sons. Therefore, Nārada is telling Vasudeva, “My dear Vasudeva, do not in any way be discouraged or doubtful about your position. Undoubtedly you are immediately going back home, back to Godhead.

However, Nārada Muni assured Śrī Vasudeva that the glories of Vasudeva and his good wife Devakī were chanted throughout the universe because even the demigods worshiped the exalted status of the Lord’s own parents. Vasudeva was not only concerned about his own spiritual position, but he also lamented for the Yadu dynasty, which had left the world in an apparently inauspicious way, being cursed by great <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> such as Nārada and dying in a fratricidal war. Although the members of the Yadu dynasty were personal associates of the Lord, their disappearance from the earth was apparently inauspicious, and therefore Vasudeva was concerned about their eventual destination. So Nārada here assures Vasudeva that even the demons who opposed Kṛṣṇa, such as Śiśupāla, Pauṇḍraka and Śālva, achieved promotion to the Lord’s own abode because of their constant absorption in thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore what to speak of the exalted members of the Yadu dynasty who actually loved Kṛṣṇa more than anything (<i>anurakta-dhiyāṁ punaḥ kim - <span style="color:#990012">อนุรกฺต-ธิยาํ ปุนฮ กิมฺ</span></i>)?

        <div id="bb78058" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Vasudeva was also feeling anxiety because on the one hand he was aware that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but at the same time he treated the Lord as his beloved son. In the relationship between the father and son, sometimes the father must chastise the son and restrict him in various ways. In this way Vasudeva was feeling that undoubtedly he had offended the Lord in his attempt to train Lord Kṛṣṇa as his son. However, Lord Kṛṣṇa is actually pleased when a pure devotee becomes absorbed in parental love for Him and thus devotedly tries to care for Him just as loving parents care for a small child. Kṛṣṇa reciprocates the intense devotional feelings of such devotees by actually appearing before them as a young boy and acting just like their son.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78059" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As mentioned in this verse, the demons actually chastised Kṛṣṇa with feelings of enmity.

The conclusion is that the devotees of the Lord should never consider Vasudeva and Devakī to be ordinary, conditioned souls. Their relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa is completely on the transcendental platform of <i>vātsalya-rasa, - <span style="color:#990012">วาตฺสลฺย-รส,</span></i> or parental love for the Personality of Godhead.

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the eternal well-wisher of every living entity, so there was no need for Vasudeva to be anxious about his future destination, nor that of the other personal associates of Kṛṣṇa, such as the members of the Yadu dynasty. In verse 46 of this chapter, Nārada Muni told Vasudeva, <i>putratām agamad yad vāṁ bhagavān īśvaro hariḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ปุตฺรตามฺ อคมทฺ ยทฺ วาํ ภควานฺ อีศฺวโร หริฮ:</span></i> “You and your good wife are now glorified throughout the universe because Lord Kṛṣṇa has personally become your son.” In this way Nārada is encouraging Vasudeva to continue to love Kṛṣṇa as his most beloved son, for such ecstatic devotional feelings are never to be given up. But at the same time, Nārada is removing Vasudeva’s doubts about the future by assuring him, “Due to your love for Kṛṣṇa you may think that He is an ordinary human being. You are appearing like a human being, and Lord Kṛṣṇa is simply reciprocating with you. In order to encourage you to love Him as your son, He is placing Himself under your control. And thus, His inconceivable power and opulences are being concealed from you. Don’t assume, however, that there is actually a dangerous situation because of the events of this material world. Although Kṛṣṇa appears to be under your control, He is eternally the supreme controller. Therefore, do not consider Him to be a human being. He is always the Supreme Personality of Godhead.”</p></div>

And thus the words <i>māyā-manuṣya-bhāvena - <span style="color:#990012">มายา-มนุษฺย-ภาเวน</span></i> here also indicate Kṛṣṇa’s original transcendental form, which resembles the humanlike forms experienced in this world. <i>Māyā</i> also indicates “mercy,” or “compassion,” according to the Sanskrit dictionary, and thus the Lord’s incarnation is understood to be His causeless mercy upon the conditioned souls. The Lord’s descent is also His causeless mercy upon the liberated souls, who take immense pleasure in joining the Lord in His pastimes and in chanting and hearing about such exalted spiritual activities (<i>śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรวณํ กีรฺตนํ วิโษฺณฮ</span></i>).</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb78066" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In order to reciprocate the love of Vasudeva for Him, Kṛṣṇa mostly concealed His unlimited opulences. In this way the devotee is fully encouraged in his particular loving relationship with the Lord. However, when Vasudeva was filled with anxiety due to the dangerous situation created by the <i>brāhmaṇa’s - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ′สฺ</span></i> curse, Nārada immediately reminded him that such anxiety was unnecessary, since all these events were under the direct control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus, the Vaiṣṇava <i>paramahaṁsas - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมหํสสฺ</span></i> who take the position of the Lord’s parents remain under the shelter of the Lord at all times and never deviate from the loving devotional service of the Lord.

And since He is the omnipotent creator of millions of universes, why do the devotees glorify as wonderful the Lord’s activities such as His killing a witch named Pūtanā by sucking out her life through her breast? Although such activities are certainly beyond the scope of ordinary human beings, why should they be considered wonderful when executed by the omnipotent Personality of Godhead? The answer is given in this verse by the word <i>nirvṛtyai - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺวฺไฤตฺย</span></i>. The Lord killed the demons not because He was envious of them, but in order to give them spiritual liberation. Thus the causeless mercy of the Personality of Godhead in liberating both the devotees and the demons by His inconceivable pastimes clearly distinguishes the Lord from any other living entity, either man or demigod. It is stated, <i>mukti-pradātā sarveṣāṁ viṣṇur eva na saṁśayaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">มุกฺติ-ปฺรทาตา สเรฺวษาํ วิษฺณุรฺ เอว น สํศยฮ:</span></i> only Viṣṇu can give liberation beyond birth and death. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has pointed out that generally the demons are awarded impersonal liberation in the Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are given the superior benediction of love of Godhead in the spiritual planets. Thus, the Lord exhibits His causeless mercy toward all classes of living entities, and His fame is spread throughout the universe. Because Kṛṣṇa is transcendental, His fame is not different from His personal incarnation, so as the Lord’s fame expands, the entire universe is gradually liberated. These are some of the unique characteristics of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>
