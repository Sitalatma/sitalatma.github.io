<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Vishvamitra ruins Vashishta&#39;s hermitage on acquiring missiles at the 
			grace of God Shiva by practising a paramount ascesis. When the forces 
			generated by Wish-ṃilker Sacred Cow, namely Kāmadhenu, have eliminated 
			Vishvamitra&#39;s army and his hundred sons, he felt indignant and pray 
			Shiva for bestowal of unusual missiles. On getting them, he again comes 
			to Sage Vashishta&#39;s hermitage and ruins it completely. Then extremely 
			infuriated Sage Vashishta resorts to his Brahma-baton to confront Vishvamitra.</p>

&quot;The threshold of that broad-minded Vashishta&#39;s hermitage fell void, and in a wink

Vividly: &#39;when I have sensibly nourished the trees, birds and animals or disciples, 
saints and sages, in indoctrinating them the true <em>dharma</em> &#39;righteous duty...&#39; 
observable by each of the birthed being, what necessitated you to harm the harmless 
&#39;fly anywhere&#39; birds, &#39;new to world&#39; calves and &#39;take what you need&#39; trees and animals... 
you should have confronted me headlong, instead... but you on seeing such a beatitude 
of this hermitage, you have become envious in your self-aggrandisement... and as 
said in an old saying like, &#39;a senseless reprehensible being, may it be a human, 
animal, bird, or a reptile is unfit to survive for long...&#39; you are now transposable 
with such a senseless being by this act of yours, which you have undertaken with 
the notion of &#39;survival of the fittest...&#39; thereby I will now show you who is fit 
enough to survive, an instructor or an intruder, in effacing your survival...&#39;</p>
