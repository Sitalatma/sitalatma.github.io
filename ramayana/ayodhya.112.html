<h3>Book II : Ayodhya Kanda - Book Of Ayodhya</h3>
<h3>chapter[Sarga] 112<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">On hearing the debate between Rama and Bharata, all the sages there were astonished. The sages request Bharata to accept Rama's words.
Bharata explains to Rama that he is unable to rule the vast kingdom alone to the satisfaction of its subjects. Bharata further adds that Rama has the
necessary competence to save the world and makes a fervent appeal to Rama to return to Ayodhya. However, Rama replies that Bharata is quite capable
of ruling the kingdom and advises Bharata to take counsel from his wise ministers before administering the kingdom. Rama reaffirms Bharata that he
will never be fulse to his father's vow. Finally, Bharata agrees to Rama;s proposition, but requests Rama to offer his sandals to be carried by him
to ayodhya so that the peope there would get gain and security. Rama agrees to it and offers his sandals to Bharata, who takes a vow before Rama to
enter fire in case he did not return immediately after the expiry of his term of exile. After embracing Bharata and Shatrughna, Rama bids farewell to
all with due respect in accord with the rank of each and enters his hermitage.</p>
