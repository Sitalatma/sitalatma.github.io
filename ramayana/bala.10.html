Any dictionary would give the meaning of courtesan as &#39;whore&#39; or as &#39;court mistress&#39;. But 
in Indian context, the courtesan is not to be taken in such a lowly way as just a prostitute 
or a whore. They belong to a caste/class of artists. Juxtaposed to the Four-Caste system there 
was a <em>deva dasi</em> Temple Dancers system, which is the artist&#39;s class. On their receiving 
enough education and skills in the performing arts and as per their capabilities, they will 
be nominated as Court Dancers or Temple Dancers and the like. Ancients recognized sixty-four 
arts <em>chatuṣaṣṭi kalā</em> , which include right from music, dance, and drama, sculpture, 
painting etc., up to the art of thievery. Kings in their political or sovereign pursuits variedly 
used these Deva Dāsis, the courtesans.</p>

This portrays the exclusion of the sage&#39;s son from the rest of the world by his father. He 
worshipped the courtesans, as he would worship some super-natural deities by saying the above
