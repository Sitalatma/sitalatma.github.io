<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama arrives at the auspicious Pampa Lake according to the suggestion of Kabandha. On seeing that pious 
environ of that lake Rama has a breather and he expects some good to happen now. On further beholding 
the ladylike Pampa Lake, his thoughts move to Seetha, and he is again dispirited. However, on overcoming 
that short spell of his anguish, he proceeds with Lakshmana to the nearby of the lake.</p>

Rama&#39;s thinking is that &#39;I happened to see a lady of unswerving loyalty to her teachers, by which adoration 
alone she is going to her desired worlds, and seeing such pious people will definitely yield good results 
from now on... hence some good shall betide us for we could have a glimpse of pious place and person 
<em>puṇya sthala, puṇya purusa, puṇya ātma sandarshana...&#39;</em> and Lakshmana thinking is &#39;this lady has served 
her teachers with such a devotion by which she is going to the heavens she desired, where placements 
in heavens will usually be determined by their relative merits... am I serving my brother, teacher, 
god, and the like... namely Rama, to have an iota of Shabari&#39;s merit... or, all the problems to Rama 
have chanced by my neglect of my duty...&#39;</p>

Vividly: The pronoun <em>saḥ</em>&nbsp; is continuously repeated word denoting &#39;such as he is...&#39; when used as opening 
word in first foot, as used in next verse, until the first verse of next canto. This expression, &#39;such 
as he is&#39; is to take us back to the olden days when Seetha was found missing and to remind us about 
his problems from then on. So the above verse is to be said like this: &#39;Rama who is so far accustomed 
to see only blood, wraiths, revenants, and souls is fed up and - such as he is, - he has seen a picturesque 
lake with a backdrop of pristine nature, and with the background music of trilling birds and rustling 
waters, then his innate need for visualising Seetha sprang up and he rushed towards lovely Lake of Pampa 
presuming her to be Lady Seetha...&#39; but we usually take liberty to cut off other words and retain &#39;he&#39; 
for pain of retyping.</p>

From here the real confusion about the arrangement of verses occurs, which is ascribed to the wrong 
copying of copyists. No two versions agree on the placement of verses and some from the next canto Kishkindha 
are also brought in here. With the result parsing of verses also goes wrong. Yet, this goes on.</p>

Two words used in the verses here <em>udghāṭa</em> a heap of things, which now became &#39;a public speech 
or lecture&#39; and the other <em>kuthā</em> detailed as above are said to be rare Sanskrit words in the 
book: &#39;Apart from <em>kutha</em> the verse quoted above contains one more word which unlike <em>kutha</em> 
is not noticed by ṃonier Williams in the sense in which it is used in Ramayana. This word is <em>udghāṭa</em>. 
It means a heap <em>samūha</em>. This meaning of the word is very rare...&#39; according to the book - 
Ramayana - A Linguistic Study, by Pt. Satya Vrata.</p>

From now until the end of first chapter of Kishkindha with a hundred couplets, we will be entering into 
the beauty of the nature. Poetics require romantic exaltation of nature, as usual,
<em>varṇana ātmakam kavitvam</em>. Rama as ṃr. Green extols it with his own tongue. 
The commentators are very much enthused by this verbal picturing of Valmiki and they have rendered more 
complex and beautiful compounds for the same verses. Why commentators, ṃahākavi Kālidas is tempted 
to rewrite Ramayana, but he refrained to do so, because he cannot possibly tell Ramayana in such a simple 
language of Valmiki. Hence, Kalidas gave it up and embarked on to write another master piece
<em>Raghu Vamsham</em>, tradition says so. Let us touch Dharmākūtam, which has 
many such complexly constructed compounds in ch. 1 of Kishkindha, and one is brought here for this lady 
called Lake Pampa, for the reading pleasure our readers.</p>
