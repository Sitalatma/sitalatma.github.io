<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Dasaratha woke up with anxious thoughts. Recalling his earlier sin, he starts recounting the story of a young ascetic to Kausalya. He
says that while he was Prince Regent of Ayodhya, he went out for hunting in a forest one day and heard the sound of a hermit-boy filling his pitcher
with water by suberging it into Sarayu River. ṃistaking the gurgling sound for trumpeting of an elephant the prince hit the boy with an arrow, which
went deep into the body and mortally wounded him. On approaching the victim, he discovered the fatal blunder and tendered his heart felt apologies to
the hermit boy, who asked him to extract the arrow from his body and inform his parents. The boy died soon after the arrow was drawn out from the
body.</p>
