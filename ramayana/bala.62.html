<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Sage Vishvamitra curses his sons as they defy his orders and accords two esoteric 
hymns to Shunashepa, for chanting them in the Vedic-ritual of Ambarīsha. Shunashepa 
gets longevity on chanting those hymns. Thus Vishvamitra not only creates another 
universe as in Trishanku&#39;s episode, he even accords longevity, or even deathlessness 
to mortals by his ascetic power. Such as he is, he is the mentor of Rama, and hence 
Sage Shatānanda informs Rama about the capabilities of his own mentor, Vishvamitra, 
in these many episodes.</p>

Vishvamitra will be nagged by almost all, including his sons, on this &#39;dog-meat-eating.&#39; 
There is a parable in ṃaha Bharata that Vishvamitra once tried to eat dog&#39;s meat 
when he did not get any food, but caught red-handedly. Later this has become the 
curse-theme to Vishvamitra when he cursed Vashishta&#39;s sons. At the present juncture 
also he curses his own sons with the same theme.</p>
