&quot;These two youngsters, oh, sage, let safety betide you, striding like audacious

that of Vishnu, and with their eyes broad like lotus-petals and with youthfulness 
in the offing they look like the exceptionally beautiful twin-gods, Ashwin-brothers, 
by their physique. How these two have footslogged and chanced here as though immortals 
have chanced on earth from the abode of gods at their pleasure? What for they have 
come here, and whose scions are they? [1-48-2, 3, 4]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>deva</em> can easily be said as a &#39;god&#39; but, this is said to be Vishnu, 
as implied at 4-43-56 of Kishkindha &#39;There the Cosmic-Souled God, namely Vishnu...&#39; 
etc. Now the enquirer himself is no less than a godly king, hence he identified 
the boys as non-terrestrial. No fatherly person accepts youngsters to footslog miles 
and miles, and so far this is an unobserved and an uncared for aspect by other sages 
and saints, because all of those sages and saints are footsloggers. This may be 
one of the reasons for Dasharatha in refusing to send Rama with Vishvamitra. However, 
King Sumati, being a glorious and fatherly king brought up this topic. Vishvamitra 
is giving a &#39;rehearsal&#39; for these brothers for their real forest trekking later 
in the legend. Further, if a divine deed is to be done and a benefit therefrom is 
to be acquired, one has to footslog. Now Rama is going to perform a divine feat 
called &#39;bending the bow of Shiva&#39; and thereby winning the hand of an unusual princess 
Seetha, in marriage. Hence, he footslogged this much distance for <em>sītā kalyāṇa 
artham, loka kalyāṇa artham</em> Seetha&#39;s marriage, which is for the &#39;universal 
goodness.&#39;</p>

arrived here travelling on an arduous path.&quot; Thus, king Sumati asked Vishvamitra. 
[1-48-5, 6]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word facial-language translated for <em>ingita</em> may be an extended expression 
for the body language.&#39; This word is for the voice muted facial expressions, given 
through smiles, eyebrows, lip movement etc. A person could be analysed by these 
very expressions as we presently call this as face reading. This is what Sugreeva 
says when sending Hanuma to Rama and Lakshmana for the first time, &#39;because you 
are an expert in reading faces, know them by their facial expressions...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Ayodhya is not fortunate enough to receive any worship from the onlookers, but it 
will be admired for its fortification. However, ṃithila is a venerable city, because 
by itself it is a temple town and the Vedic-rituals etc., will be going on forever. 
It is a blessed place as it has Shiva&#39;s Bow, for which bow ritual worship is be 
ongoing from time immemorial.</p>
