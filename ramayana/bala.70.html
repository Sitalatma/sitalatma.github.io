  <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p class="txt">
 Ikshvaku's bloodline is narrated as custom demands to enquire into the
          bridegroom's lineage. Vashishta narrates this to Janaka and his brother Kushadhvaja, who
          is also summoned to participate in the wedding celebrations, and who later has to offer
          his two daughters to Bharata and Shatrughna. This listing and eulogising ancestors is an
          adjunctive custom in Indian marriages. Nowadays it is limited to cite only three
          preceding generations, instead of narrating from the first, since nobody holds his family
          tree, ready at hand.</p>
