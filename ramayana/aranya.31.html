<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 31<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">A spy of Ravana named Akampana rushes to him to break the news of annihilation of Janasthāna by Rama. He suggests Ravana to abduct
Seetha. Because parting with Seetha causes grief to Rama and thereby he dies. On thinking for while, Ravana goes to ṃareecha seeking his help in
abducting Seetha. ṃareecha while explaining Rama's capabilities, reminds us of the incarnations of Vishnu, and advises Ravana to be content with what
he has.</p>
<p class="tat">
This chapter is removed from the critical edition and retained by traditional versions There are discussions on this chapter whether
it is the original work or an interpolated one. Some more details are given in the endnote. Akampana's character inevitably has continuity in the war
scene at the end.</p>

countrysides or villages at least, annexing it. If Janasthāna is ruined, Lanka is also going ruin soon, because none can crossover the
bulwark-like-Janasthāna. rājan 'oh, king of demons...' 'when demons in Janasthāna are ruined, your kingship gets ruined...' bahavaḥ 'many...' 'not

dawned on this spy just now. Then the question that arises is: How a sagacious spy prompted Ravana to abduct Seetha? There are two answers for
this.</p>
<p class="comment">1. Any employee is a half-slave to his master, <em>artha dāsā janāḥ sarve </em>as the money paid makes one a slave of the payer. This
spy prompted Ravana in that way because he knows that Ravana is womaniser. Like-king-like-subjects 
<em>yathā rājā tathā prajāḥ</em>thus great-demons
think alike. Further Ravana did not ask for the triggering point for the elimination of these many demons. If Ravana questions about it, Akampana had
to say that Ravana's own sister Shūrpanakha wanted to debauch. Then Ravana's rage multiplies and he may even kill Akampana.</p>
<p class="comment">2. All the sages, including Agastya, have declared to Rama that they have planned to bring Rama to Janasthāna only to eliminate
the demons at Janasthāna and going further from Janasthāna to Lanka and eliminating Ravana is Rama's headache. Which happens owing to Seetha.
<em>ānītaḥ tvam imam desham upāyena maharṣhibhiḥ ||
3-30-35 </em>Thus this sagacious Akampana is plotting to bring Seetha firstly, for whom Rama comes conquering Ravana, and then the demons on
earth will be eradicated. Without Janasthāna Lanka is nothing but an open-door castle. So, the sages paved way for Rama through Janasthāna to
Lanka.</p>

<p class="comment">
This chapter is a scarecrow to the aesthetics of Ramayana and 
a milestone to commentators of Ramayana. We usually find in Ramayana spectacular entrances for cities, 
characters, and situations. Before such a fantastic entrance of Ravana, for which a full sarga/chapter 
is allotted, this chapter is said to be a glaring hurdle. In here, this Akampana is glorified as a sagacious 
person, yet he gives advise to Ravana to abduct Seetha. This advice is said to contain the setting of 
the ultimate war-field in Lanka. But, the weight of the very same advise by Shūrpanakha is lost to 
this of a spy. Shūrpanakha&#39;s intent is very clear, but the meaning, purpose and the achievement of 
this spy is very unclear, except to that which is said by commentators.</p>

<p  class="comment">
Ravana on going to ṃāreecha, and hearing all indirect puraṇa-s 
&#39;mythologies...&#39; returns to Lanka as a gentleman. If he were to be this gentle, Ramayana would not be 
there. But ṃaheshvara Tīrtha, the commentator says:
<em>ata eva 
rāvaṇasya sītā rāma bhṛityatvena tā uddisya tena vakṣhyamāṇāni bāhya dṛiṣhṭyā durbhāṣhaṇa 
vat pratīyamānāni api vākyāni - - vastutaḥ stuti parāṇi eva</em>&nbsp; &#39;Though the utterances 
of Ravana apparently mean as vile, but their subtext is that of a devotee of Vishnu. -- ṃaheshvara 
Tīrtha</p>

<p class="comment">
If Ravana is a true devotee, basing on many mythologies and sub-mythologies, 
the way in which he treated Seetha in Lanka is evident and it pictures him as a clear-cut villain. Thus 
says another commentator, namely Rama Tilaka, whose aim is to elicit literary values of Ramayana, 
and who dismisses all 
this hyperboling. Whether this chapter is interpolated or original, this is included in traditional versions, and 
hence it is to be sincerely incorporated here, because commentators have said a lot about it. So goes the 
tradition.</p>
