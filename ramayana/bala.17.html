			Gandharva-s (Southey&#39;s Glendoveers) are celestial musicians inhabiting Indra&#39;s 
			heaven and forming the orchestra at all the banquets of the principal deities. 
			Yaksha-s, demigods attendant especially on Kubera, and employed by him in the 
			care of his garden and treasures. Kimpurusha-s, demigods attached also to the 
			service of Kubera, celestial musicians, represented like centaurs reversed with 
			human figures and horses&#39; heads. Siddha-s, are demigods or spirits of undefined 
			attributes, occupying with the Vidyādharā-s the middle air or region between 
			the earth and the sun. Griffith.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Rama and Lakshmana will use arrows and missiles as their weaponry in the ensuing 
			final war with Ravana. The vanara soldiers use stones, trees, and their own claws 
			and nails. The golden maces or clubs handled by Hanuma, Sugreeva, and Vali usually 
			depicted in pictures are for more mythical ornamentation to glorify the characters. 
			However, these Vānaras are well versed in the knowledge of such tactical weaponry, 
			only to save themselves from their usage against them, but do not use them necessarily. 
			In Sundara Kanda Hanuma will be tied by a magical weapon called Brahma astra when 
			he is in Lanka. Though knowing the release from that Brahma astra, Hanuma does 
			not utilise that knowledge there.</p>
