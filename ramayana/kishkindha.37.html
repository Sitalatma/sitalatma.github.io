<h3>chapter [Sarga] 37<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">ṃonkey chiefs go round the earth at the behest of Sugreeva, to fetch all the monkey champions on earth to the presence of Sugreeva.
They all go to different mountain, rivers, oceans, and forests and motivate all monkeys to reach Sugreeva at once. Further, having gone to Himalayas
they find divine fruits, tubers and medicinal herbs there, which they fetch as royal gifts to Sugreeva. They all return to Sugreeva in the same time
when Sugreeva is with Lakshmana and prior to the other monkeys that are summoned.</p>

While discussing some phonetic tendencies, Dr. Satya Vrat says 'Inter change of certain sounds is
an accepted phonetic phenomena in Sanskrit. ṃany classical Sanskrit poets have based their double
entendres on this... Ramayana, however, is somewhat different... it preserves only an odd instance
of each of the interchange of 'Da' and 'la' and 'ra' and 'la'....' The phonetic licence takes from
the rulings like: <em>Da la yoḥ abhedaḥ; ra la yoḥ abhedaḥ; va ba yoḥ abhedaḥ</em> 'there is no
phonetic difference between <em>Da</em> or <em>la</em>, and <em>ra</em> or <em>la</em>, and
<em>va</em> or <em>ba</em>'. At 7-26-6 of ūtara rāmayna the commonly known <em>nāri kela</em> is
used as <em>nāri kera</em>, in it original phonetic form. And the Bengalis even now pronounce
<em>ba</em> for <em>va</em>. Even the English keyboard of typewriters too, provide <em>b</em>
adjacent to <em>v</em> .</p>
