<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda -The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 4<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Lakshmana explains about Seetha's abduction and their inability to trace her whereabouts. As informed earlier by a demon freed from
his curse and who became a celestial, Lakshmana says that they are searching for one Sugreeva, King of Vanmara-s, to befriend him in order to take
help in searching for Seetha. Hanuma who is on a similar mission to befriend these two warriors, as instructed by Sugreeva in the earlier chapter,
comes to a conclusion that the needs of both the friends would be fulfilled. Then Hanuma takes the two bothers on his back to the place where
Sugreeva is hiding from Vali.</p>
