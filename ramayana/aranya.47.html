<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 47<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">The debate of Seetha and Ravana has started, as Ravana wished to woo Seetha. In the first instance Seetha believes him to be a Vedic
Brahman but insists to know about him. Ravana reveals his identity and asks her to become his wife. Thereupon she goes into a frenzied state and
brainstorms Ravana in all her curtness.</p>

When Ravana whose intention is to abduct her has enquired thus, then on the basis of his Brahman friar's mien Seetha informed about
herself on her own. [3-47-1]</p>

<p class="tat">
Thinking briefly that, 'he is a Brahman and an untimely guest, he will indeed curse me if he is not replied,' Seetha spoke this
sentence. [3-47-2]</p>

his stomach. But he is Brahman, because he came booming Vedic hymns, which no other lesser Brahman can do. Thus, he is someone with a perfect Vedic
background... and according to the saying:&nbsp; <em>yatīnām pūjanam kāryam striyā vā 
puruṣena...</em> &#39;&nbsp; an ascetic is to be revered either by a lady or a
gentleman...' and thus he cannot be turned out saying 'my husband is not at home...' and if he is neglected he may curse...' these are the
criss-cross thoughts of Seetha at that moment. Ghastly Viradha boldly carried her off at one time, but she is yet to see the cunningness of a demon.
So with a half-belief and half-heart she started to talk to him.</p>

taken as a forewarning to Ravana, as she immediately says who her husband is, as she is aware that 
this friar is Ravana. Then it implicitly means &#39;you who wish to abduct me, think twice, for my 
husband is Rama, and let safety prevail on whole of your dynasty, for it is hard to deal with Rama

saying that she had to enjoy &#39;humanly indulgences...&#39; because her husband incarnated himself as a 
man, and since she had to enjoy along with him in her in-law&#39;s place, she enjoyed those luxuries. 
Or, if this is read as <em>a+ mānuṣa bhogān </em>&#39;superhuman delights...&#39; [of course, not &#39;inhuman 
delights...&#39;] she enjoyed heavenly comforts as she was enjoying as Lakshmi in <em>vaikunṭha </em>

after immolating herself as Vedavati, in an earlier incarnation, only to end Ravana.</p>

narrations are there in calculating the age of Rama and Seetha, at this point of legend with these 
stanzas. The letter <em>bha </em>in the line <em>mama bhartā mahātejā </em>is the ninth letter of 
Gayatri hymn and thus the ninth book of Ramayana with thousand couplets is started from here. The 
whole of Ramayana is with twenty-four thousand verses and Gayatri hymn has twenty-four letters, and 
each book of Ramayana contains a thousand verses, starting with each letter of Gayatri. This is the

<div id="btn4" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">The dexterity of an archer depends mainly on his sighting and targeting eye. 
Hence, the eyes and dexterity are to be coupled instead of cleaving them as two attributes of Rama. 
Otherwise, in Seetha&#39;s saying that &#39;my husband is a broad-eyed one...&#39; it does not make any sense to 
Ravana, because Ravana&#39;s eyes are much more bigger and bloodshot. Thus &#39;my ambidextrous husband&#39;s 
eyes are broad <em>puṇDarīka vishāla akshaḥ, </em>and those eyes are a couple of fish-eye lenses 
of a camera and can view in 360º, thus you cannot escape their target, in any angle...&#39; Further, 
these and some more attributes in the coming verses like <em>simha uraska </em>etc., they are the 
very same words coined by Sage Narada, while informing Valmiki about Rama in the first chapter of 
Bala Kanda. Some think such repetitions are essentially Homeric. But in Indian scripts they are not 
mere repetitions but reiteration of the very same concept in the very same words, which is not an 
epical flaw in view of the ruling <em>ādarāt punarukti, ādarāt dvirukti... </em>&#39;an affectionate 
reiteration...&#39; Hence, the very same words are put on the tongue of the principle character, Seetha.</p>

ignorance about Ravana. As a housewife, it is a natural question to be put to an out-of-way friar moving in the deep of forests. Here, neither a
village, nor a single family, nor even a human being is available to accord alms, and this odd almsman is moving here who is supposed to move about
villages as said: <em>bhiksha artham grāmam pravishet.</em> Or, she must be asking him about his caste, creed etc., when he was a householder. But it is out
of place. On the other hand, if Seetha is from a well-trained family, she is not supposed to question the caste, creed, and name of a real sanyāsi.
Again, she is asking him to reveal himself 'in essence, truthfully.' She might have thought him to be a cursing Brahman in the first instance, but
she might have found him out to be a pseudo-sanyāsi. Now that she is slowly realising that he may not be a proper Brahman either, she may be asking
him straightforwardly. Because Ravana is coming out of Brahman's guise in next two stanzas, it is said that she pointedly asked him as above.</p>

the lioness and her cubs have their share and go away. Then it is the day of the fox-in-the-ditch. 'Like a fox-in-the-ditch, how you dare to come to
an inaccessible lioness, when the lion departed...' Next, Sun's wife is Prabha or Shine and she is non-figural resplendent entity. She is perceivable
but untouchable. If anyone can lay his hands on her by the dint of his yogic or ascetic practises, and if he baskets that Shine for use in night,
that night becomes a day, for it will be shining with sunshine, and thus his pleasurable night is evanished. Thereby he looses his minimal personal
comfort of a night and it will be self-ruinous to experiment with such ideas.</p>
