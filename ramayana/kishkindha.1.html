<h2>Kishkindha kanda</h2>



<br><h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy ṃonkeys</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 1<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Rama in his pursuit to regain Seetha reaches Pampa Lake along with Lakshmana. Rama visualises Pampa 
Lake as a heavenly abode and narrates to Lakshmana the suffering he is undergoing due to the departure 
of Seetha, i.e., the departure of innate soul from the Supreme. Seetha is the alter ego of Rama, either 
in heaven or on earth. In heavens she is Goddess Lakshmi and she incarnates herself as Seetha on earth. 
In the first chapter of Kishkindha Kanda the elaborate description of Pampa Lake and its surroundings 
is to be taken as a two-fold narration, one pertaining to Divinity, the other to Rama, the human. The 
area of Pampa Lake metaphors with heavens, and its trees and birds with divine souls, and who incidentally 
are teachers too. The fragrant breeze metaphors with god&#39;s gift, flowers as pure knowers and knowledge, 
and the tranquil water as clear heart and so on. Rama as hero of the epic is in search of Seetha. Rama 
as god incarnate is also in search of true devotees who are entrapped in the bodies of living beings. 
The true devotees are the trees, birds, flowers, waters and other naturals except the humans who cherish 
the earthly comforts. Thus Rama&#39;s sorrowing over Seetha and Bharata is in similitude with the god&#39;s 
sorrowing for the true devotees, who needs salvation from the birth and death cycle. Hence the god incarnate 
Rama is in search of true devotee like Seetha, who is now in a distant place and needs some education 
about her release from the embodiment in Lanka. Later Rama finds Hanuma, the teacher, who will be deputed, 
to Seetha to enlighten her about her release. In the last two chapters of Aranya Kanda there will be 
some 61 verses detailing about Pampa Lake and Rama&#39;s love for Seetha. But in Gorakhpur and Eastern recessions 
there are 130 verses in this first canto of Kishkindha and some 20 verses in the fag end chapter of 
Aranya canto. In these many verses Rama expresses his deep-rooted emotion for Seetha, which the ancient 
commentators have interpreted to be the God&#39;s deep-seated love and anguish for the created souls. The 
comparison is, Rama to Vishnu, Seetha to the created soul, now captivated in the embodiment called Lanka, 
and Lakshmana as the true devout. God needs a messenger or a ṃessiah or as per Hindu tradition the Guru, 
the teacher. That is what Hanuma. Rama as a god incarnate is actually in search of a true teacher, for 
which the surroundings of Pampa Lake are exemplified as good surroundings for finding such a true teacher. 
As far as possible, the commentaries of ancients are given in comment section of those verses. At the 
fag end of this chapter, the mighty monkey hero Sugreeva, moving on the Rishyamuka ṃountain sees Rama 
and Lakshmana entering into his territory, flees into deep forests, fearing them to be enemies.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. 1. saḥ</em> = such as he is, [viz. he who took birth in Ayodhya, relegated from kingdom, exiled 
to forets, lost his wife, and who is searching for her in wilderness, such Rama]; <em>tām puṣhkariṇīm 
gatvā</em> = that, lotus lake [Pampa,] arriving at; <em>padma utpala jhaṣha ākulām</em> = lotuses, 
Costuses, fishes, full with; <em>rāmaḥ saumitri sahitaḥ</em> = Rama, ṣumitra&#39;s son,[Lakshmana,] along 
with; <em>vilalāpa</em> = lamented; <em>akulendriyaḥ</em> = disturbed, senses [emotions disturbed.]</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama, on arriving at that Lake of Lotuses called Pampa along with Lakshmana, which is full with lotuses, 
costuses, and fishes, lamented as his emotions are disturbed, on seeing the beauty of the Lake comparable 
with Seetha&#39;s face. [4-1-1]</p>

<div id="btn0" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
In this very first verse itself the auspicious nature of the land of Kishkindha is implanted. Rama as 
hero of this epic identifies his heroine Seetha&#39;s face with the tranquil sheet of lake&#39;s water, her 
eyes with the lotuses, and her quick glances with the quick swims of the fishes in the lake. Rama as 
god incarnate observes the tranquil sheet of water as the quiescence of his creation. The red lotuses 
are meditatively standing, as the devotees ready to be taken away to the feet of their god. The swimming 
fishes are seen as the souls captivated in human bodies, rushing hither and thither for salvation, which 
is hindered by the banks of life [here the banks of the lake.] Thus on certain occasions we chance to 
meet with the different points of view of Rama, one as hero and the other as god incarnate, derived 
from the metaphors or similes by the ancient commentators.</p>

<em>3. ṣoumitri! vaidūrya vimala udakā</em> = cat&#39;s-eye-gem [lapis lazuli] like, clear, with water;

<div id="btn1" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
The clear water is devout-soul and the bloomed lotuses are the tranquil faces of the devotees. The water 
is like cat&#39;s eye gem. Cat&#39;s eye or Lapis Lazuli is &#39; a beautiful stone consisting of calcite and other 
minerals coloured ultramarine...&#39; and a precious stone of Sri Lanka and the ṃalabar Coast...&#39; thus say 
chambers and Oxford dictionaries, and it is Indian, that too South Indian specific. It is one of the 
nine gems, in <em>nava-ratna </em>combination.

<div id="btn2" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Secondly the usage of <em>vaidūrya vimala udaka </em>is an often-repeated expression, which may not 
be construed only that the waters are like cats-eye or Lapis Lazule, the precious gem in nava ratna/ 
nine-gem combination. In fine composition it is <em>smaraṇa alankāra </em>, a metaphorical memorabilia. 
If it were said that the water is like <em>vaidūrya </em>or cat&#39;s-eye or Lapis, it reminds us of all 
other eight gems including a diamond. As such the waters are crystalline and pellucid in their look 
like priceless gems, for water is the invaluable gem-like gift of nature and flowing waters are the 
priceless possessions for livelihood as well.</p>

In some other version like Eastern version the word ṃādhava i.e., Love God ṃanmadha used for <em>ādhayaḥ</em> 
because the <em>alankāra</em> or the aesthetics demand the description of vasantha requires ṃanmadha. 
Then the compound is read as <em>santaptam mādhavaḥ pīdayanniva</em> comes there, meaning that &#39;the 
Vasanta, the spring season, or the personified ṃanmadha, the Love God, is distressing me, besides the 
problems of anguished Bharata and abduction of Seetha.&#39; It is said that Rama remembers Bharata too, 
along with Seetha at this juncture, because as a god incarnate He remembers the sufferance of these 
innate souls dedicated to Him. Bharata is another <em>kainkarya</em> /dedicatee of Rama, the divine, 
like Lakshmana.</p>

The appreciation of nature is said to be of divine nature, for the Divine creates the nature that itself 
is of Divine nature. The high crowned trees are the sessile teachers and the flowers and birds are mobile 
students, who always surround the teachers. Rama in search of some good teacher to convey his message 
to the captive Seetha finds some other great teachers of nature, but whom he cannot utilise for his 
purpose because they are sessile. He however praises them while remembering Seetha. The touch of Cupid 
is for the Rama, the Hero, and the touch of anguish in search of a good teacher is for the god incarnate.</p>

The kokila is not exactly a cuckoo, for cuckoo gives out a two note call whereas the kokila gives out 
a single lengthy call with up and down of its tone, and also replies its imitative cooing of the humans. 
However it belongs to the same species of cuckoo. Here the &#39;air itself is singing&#39; has the similitude 
with singing of Sama Veda hymns, which here is coming out of mountain caves, where the caves themselves 
are the abode of the hermits and sages, who sing Sama hymns. Later in the canto the monkey heroes also 
dwell in caves, and are equated with the pre-eminent teaches who always sing in the praise of God, which 
will be as good as singing the Vedic Hymns. Now the air emerging from the caverns of yonder firmaments 
is singing Sama Veda applauding Rama, the Divine.</p>

Prof. R. D. Ranade, the eminent professor of Indian Philosophies said that &quot;Translations are always 
bound to be uncouth; they are like a heavy cart-load which moves slowly along...&quot; So also Ramayana, 
whose text itself is a cartload, and the translations become many more cartloads. ṃuch can be said in 
Kishkindha Kanda, for it comprises of many a derivative, which cannot be compressed and put together. 
The hero-heroine and the god incarnate aspects, together with some Indian philosophies included, are 
sufficient to become some more cartloads. The Hindu Love-god, ṃanmadha, unlike his European counterpart 
Cupid, has no body. At one time, Shiva burned Him down physically, for arousing lasciviousness in Shiva 
Himself. But Shiva makes the Love-god ṃanmadha to thrive without a physical body, at the request of 
Love God&#39;s wife Rati. Hence Love God is also called <em>an anga</em> = without, body. The bodiless nature 
and only the emotive responses in love are symbolical with the formless activity of romancing aroused 
by <em>ananga</em> or ṃanmadha, i.e., Love God. Alternately the word ṃanmadha not necessarily be taken 
as a noun, denoting the Love God alone. As a phrasal verb it denotes, mind, churning. <em>mann; manas; 
madhaḥ - mannamsi mathate iti manmathaḥ...</em> to churn. There is a platform called <em>manas</em> 
, below the subconscious level, and above sensory organs, which receives all the input from the sensory 
organs, which the manas separates, categorises, analyses and so on, and then sends to databank at subconscious 
level. Amara Kosha defines it as <em>cittantu ceto hṛidayam svāntam hṛin mānasam manaḥ || dhī varga</em>and 
the separation is <em>chittam, chetaḥ, hridayam, svāntam, hrit, mānasam, manḥ</em> and this is not 
the composite mind, but a faculty of reason, what we generally call, a heart, a mind, a thought etc. 
Hence the lamentation of Rama is more churned out of his manas for Seetha, not just for amorousness, 
but for real love. And love, as per good old saying, is togetherness. Having lost that togetherness, 
Rama is pouring out his heart churned agony. Yet again, Rama the god indulges in those that are indulged 
in Him, and here his thoughts are constantly indulged in Seetha, his alter ego in heavens and on earth. 
In the Vaishnava mythologies, Vishnu incarnating on earth always looses his consort, Goddess Lakshmi 
and roams over to find Her. It is the same situation in <em>narasimha</em> incarnation. Goddess Lakshmi 
is a treasure house that can be abducted by the greedy, after which Her consort Vishnu searches and 
retrieves Her, for no one on earth can amass heavenly wealth. In Lakshmi tantra, the Vaishnava āgama 
text Lakshmi states that: <em>aham nārāyanī nāma sā sattā vaiṣhṇavī parā</em> &quot; I am indeed 
Nārāyanee [i.e. Lakshmi] the supreme essence of Vishnu...&quot; [Lakshmi Tantra 3.1.] Hence, Seetha may 
not be taken as yet another princess from this viewpoint.</p>

Vasanta or spring is a friendly season, and Kishkindha is a friendly place, [and Rama gets more friends 
in this place later,] but Rama&#39;s lifetime friend and supreme essence is missing. For god, this burning 
is the sensation or perception of energy as warmth shown by the devout nature, and its blessed souls. 
Shaiva/Shākta traditions emphasises the power and majesty of the God, whereas the Vaishnava theory 
demands a heart pouring devotion to achieve the God&#39;s saving grace <em>anugraha</em> . Hence the lamentation 
of Rama as god is for the departure of his Shakti, i.e., Goddess Lakshmi, visualising all the nature 
and its component devotees he created, such as, trees, peacocks, birds, flowers, waters, mountains etc. 
All of this nature and its components are maddening Him for love from that Shakti.</p>

The iridescent eye like spots on the back plumage of the peacock are said to be like a <em>gavāksha, 
go aksha</em>&nbsp; cow, eye. There used to be cow-eye like ventilators on the walls of ancient house 
to permit the air to circulate. Even a single feather of peacock is called the eye of the peacock for 
its glittering eye like spot. Here the air is permeating these eyes on the plumage of peacock and making 
those eyes look like crystals. Thus the spring breeze is permeating anywhere, including Rama, causing 
a want for the togetherness with Seetha. Unlike other birds, the peacocks do not mate often and in open. 
It has some ritual like dancing and secret in its conduct of mating.</p>

&quot;The boons and curses in Ramayana&quot; is an exclusive subject and there are a variety of books on these 
subjects. So also, the prognostications are another subject. Special attention will be paid to the cawing 
of the crow, for Rama blessed the crow. A crow is said to have requested Rama to remove its ugly look. 
Rama instead of blessing the crow to look like a white-swan blessed it to be proficient in foretelling. 
The crow&#39;s cawing is for both good and bad omens, which even now is an accepted belief. If the crow 
roves over in the sky continuously cawing, it is bad omen. If it sits on nearby tree or wall and caws 
incessantly, it is good omen to get desired things or to indicate the arrival of dear ones etc. Such 
prognostications are available by way of bad dreams etc., at many places in Ramayana.</p>

There is a discussion whether Pampa is a lake or a river. There are two rivers in Karnataka State of 
India, one Tunga and the other Bhadra, at whose confluence it is called Tunga Bhadra. The Vijayanagara 
Empire built their capital Hampi at this place. The regional language Kannada uses &#39; ha &#39; for Sanskrit 
&#39; pa &#39; and hence Pampa is now called Hampi. Long before Vijayanagara dynasty, this place is ascribed 
to be Pampa, where the Kishkinda, the capital of monkey kings was situated. &quot;The kingdom of Vanara or 
monkey race was in the north and west of ṃysore, their chief city being Kishkindha near the village 
of Hampi on Tungabhadra...&quot; ṃysore and Conty Vol. I, page.178--Reie Vol. I pg. 146, and also in Bombay 
Gazetteer Vol. I pg. 142 of Dr. Bhandarkar. There are four copper plate inscriptions, dating around 
3012 BC, at Shimoga District, Karnataka State, ascribing that Janamejaya, son of Parikshat makes grants 
to the Pampa area, because his great grand father Yudhisthara of ṃaha Bharata rested on the banks of 
Tungabhadra at this place. However there is a vast lake like formation at present day Hospet and Hampi 
in Karnataka State, where three rivers, namely Tungabhadra, Varada and Hagari and their tributaries 
etc., meet and disperse. This place is geographically at Long. 76�--78�, and Lat. 12�--16�.</p>

This verse is well explained by the ancient commentators in many derivatives. Some of them are:</p>


<div id="btn37" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">1] Rama wanted to take comfort in the breeze, at least. But that 
breeze itself is troubling him, because it is carrying the fragrance of the pollen of lotuses, which 
is like the fragrance of Seetha&#39;s breath.<em> surabhi nishvashite dadatahtrishām</em> as in <em>laxana shāstra</em> 
. Exhale of the beloved bears a kind of fragrance, which is known only to her lover. Seetha also holds 
the lotus dear and every aspect of Seetha is lotus oriented and thus Rama&#39;s remembering of Seetha by 
seeing lotuses. [Ibid. <em>satatam priya pankajām</em> - 4-1-67.]</p>


<div id="btn38" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">2] Goddess Lakshmi sits in the middle of the lotus, which will 
be in the heart of Vishnu. As of now She is stolen and Rama could not avert it. Hence the lotuses are 
angered at the loss of their resident Goddess Lakshmi, are taking the help of the breeze to carry the 
scent of the pollen, which is akin to Seetha&#39;s breath, and invade Rama&#39;s heart, to regain their tenant. 
Then a question arises as to why Rama confronts the invasion of this spring breeze without going away 
from there. In reply it is said that this breeze is like Seetha&#39;s breath, and it is coming from out 
of the thickets of the forests. So she must be around and appear to him any moment. Regaining Seetha 
is prime ordeal than the invasion of the cool spring breeze.</font><div id="btn39" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">3] Another way of putting this is: -- <em>padma</em> </em>= Goddess Lakshmi; 
<em>kesara - or - kesaraiḥ</em> = affection, like fragrant pollen; <em>samshṛiṣṭaḥ </em>= carrying; 
<em>vṛiksha antara vi nisshruta </em>= tree of the Universe, within it, emitted;<em> nishvāsa iva</em> = uninterrupted breathe, like; 
<em>sīthāyā </em>= of Nature [Seetha the feminine, is symbolised with the whole creative Universe,] 
<em>vāyuḥ</em> = all-pervading 
ether [mythical]; <em>manaḥ </em>= [sins of] heart; <em>haraḥ </em>= stealing/obliterating one.</p>

there tomorrow, i.e., this Universe perishes, are inthe firmament and its stem, branches, and leaves 
spread upside down as this Universe. This is similar to the Igdrasil of Scandinavian mythology. Goddess 
Lakshmi sitting in Her Divine Lotus in empyrean abode exhales Her uninterrupted affection as the all-pervading 
ether, within the tree i.e., Universe, which is the life principle. When the created being is endowed 
with Her affection, but becomes a sinner, She recommends even that sinner to the Almighty Vishnu for 
obliteration of his sins and to accord salvation. Hence Vaishnavites demand heart-pouring devotion to 
the Almighty, than indulging in earthly cherishing. This is termed as <em>nirhetuka satata dyā prasāra</em>

The question of self-control of Rama in indulgence is discussed here. Rama&#39;s libido is not expressed 
after the abduction of Seetha, until his entry into the area of Pampa or its forests. Here, in these 
surroundings of Pampa, the spring season is at its height and the nature is adding fire to his fuelling 
desire. What anyone can do but to lament about his unconsummated desire? That too, when ṃanmadha, the 
Love God, assumes the charge of this particular chaitra month, or spring season, it is impossible to 
play-act celibacy. For more details about such a condition, Gosvami Tulasi Das is perhaps the best poet 
to narrate in Ram charita ṃanas, at Doha 73 to 76 of Bāla Kānda. Narrated in there is, that the saints 
and sages lost their loincloths, chastity belts peeled off on their own, and entire social order went 
topsy-turvy, when ṃanmadha took charge of the Universe for only a few moments, to kindle Shiva&#39;s love 
towards Parvati. As such the nature at Pampa itself has become a love god to Rama, to pour out his passion 
for Seetha.</p>

The word <em>shakrāya</em> is in Dative case, meaning that the throne of Ayodhya is meant for an Indra-like

Seetha is an unusual princess by birth. Winning her hand in marriage is unusually preconditioned by 
King Janaka with the lifting of Shiva&#39;s bow, which none else could do than Rama. Having won Seetha&#39;s 
hand in marriage, but lost her in the forest, will be ridiculous. Rama reflects here as to how his father-in-law

The above is the wrong orientation of words used in above two verses. While the word-to-word translation 
of Ramayana is rare in print medium, the prose versions are giving meanings with such orientation, and 
they will be usually found in almost all printed books. The above suggests that Lakshmana is asking 
Rama to forget Seetha, which is meaningless. The following is said to be the reasonable orientation. 
Other words being same, the rest are:</p>

is engulfed under the weight of his fear. [4-1-129]</p>

The lustful words of Rama are to be construed as pure pleasure forhaving Seetha at his side, as a longing

Ramayana-s or Purana-s which deal with the episode of Rama&#39;s reaction on seeing Pampa Lake have the

components of nature, for his lust is not satiated. It is as below: -</font></font></p>
