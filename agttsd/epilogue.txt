letter=My dear Harikeśa Mahārāja,

Please accept my most humble obeisances. His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda has received your ecstatic BBT Trustee Report dated July 13th, 1977, and has instructed me to reply you.

I could not get very far, only the first two paragraphs, before Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped me, saying, “All the blessings of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Mahārāja upon you. You are the most important grandson of Bhaktisiddhānta. Go on doing like this.” When His Divine Grace began to hear the huge quantity of books which you are in the midst of printing, covering thirteen languages, he said, “This is tremendous. Do it very nicely. And scholarly, that will be complete…”

His Divine Grace concluded his ecstatic appreciation of your efforts by saying, "He is surpassing all BBTs. I want to go to Germany immediately but I am physically unfit. I like that place—the Schloss. It is a very nice place. Thank you very much.”

Hoping this meets you in the best of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

sign=Your servant,<br />Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami<br />Secretary to Śrīla Prabhupāda
