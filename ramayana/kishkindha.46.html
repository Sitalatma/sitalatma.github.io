<br><h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy ṃonkeys</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 46<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Sugreeva&#39;s knowledge of physical world is acquired when Vali put him to flight. Rama enquires with Sugreeva as 
to how Sugreeva has many details of lands, countries, rivers, and mountains. In reply, Sugreeva says that when 
repulsed by Vali he was on the run to pillar to post, until he finally settled on ṃt. Rishyamuka. During such 
a plighted flight, Sugreeva says, he acquired a direct and personal knowledge of earth.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;When Vali repulsed the buffalo-shaped demon Dundubhi towards ṃalaya mountain, then that buffalo entered the cave 
of ṃt. ṃalaya, and even Vali entered therein wishing to kill that buffalo. [4-46-3, 4]</p>

<p class="comment">
This buffalo-demon Dundubhi was killed by Vali in Kishkindha and its carcass was hurled into the precincts of 
Sage ṃatanga&#39;s hermitage. While that demon was killed there, Sugreeva is now telling that this demon was killed 
in a cave. The demon killed in cave was ṃāyāvi, as said in ch. 9 of this canto. ṃāyāvi and Dundubhi are brothers 
and sons of ṃaya. ṃaheshvara Tīrtha says because Dundubhi is the son of buffalo-demon ṃaya, i.e., Dundubhi Sr., 
thus he can be called as Dundubhi. And Govindaraja says: </p>

<p class="comment">
<em>dundubheḥ pūrvajaḥ agrajaḥ sutaḥ mayasya iti seṣhaḥ vakṣhyatu uttara kāṇDe mayaḥ - māyāvī 
prathamaḥ stāt dundubhiḥ tat anantaram iti...&nbsp; </em>&#39;ṃāyāvi is the first son and the second one 
is Dundubhi- as said by ṃaya in Uttara Kanda...&#39; Then it is assumed that both ṃāyāvi and Dundubhi have come 
in the first instance for a fight with Vali. But on seeing Vali and Sugreeva, Dundubhi might have entered into 
the cave with ṃāyāvi and somehow escaped from there, and thus only ṃāyāvi is killed by Vali. Later Dundubhi 
came at the gate of Kishkindha and was killed by Vali. Hence, Sugreeva&#39;s referring to Dundubhi here includes both 
ṃāyāvi and Dundubhi.</p>

&quot;Even at Himalayas, ṃt. ṃeru, like that at the Northern Ocean, Vali drove me back, and when the clemency from 
Vali, or a shelter, or even a foothold on earth was indeterminable, then Hanuma, whose prosperity is his wisdom, 
said a word to me. [4-46-20, 21a]</p>

This and last few chapters that describe the topography and geography of earth may seem redundant or a wasteful 
narration. No purpose is apparently solved in narrating at such a length and in such vividness, when the main 
purpose is searching Seetha. Sugreeva might have simply said &#39;go and search everywhere...&#39; This is as inquired 
by the commentator of Dharmākūtam. </p>

For this it is replied that at the outset of undertaking a high-risk task like the elimination of Ravana, some 
pious deeds of seeing, hearing, or telling about the pious lands, mountains, rivers, and sages that dwell 
thereabout, are to be undertaken. A laudatory salutation to ṃother Earth is a sacred act. So Sugreeva has 
earned some merit in eulogising places and sending his troops to all places as a kind of tīrtha yātra &#39;a 
pilgrimage...&#39; as said by the commentator: </p>

with them for attacking Vali, in the second instance, in Kishkindha ch. 13. Rama was not successful in the first 
round of attacking Vali, as he venerated none such tutelary in first round.</p>
