When a tempter can convincingly prove that a woman&#39;s husband is &#39;unfit&#39; then only he can succeed in 
his overtures. His theorematic reasoning is to let down Rama from Seetha&#39;s viewpoint, as she has broad-eyes, 
and she is supposed to see reality: &#39;Rama is rendered to nothing as said in an age-old saying <em>bhagnā 
kṛiṣe bhāgavatā bhavanti </em>&#39;when manly pursuits fail, he turns out as a sanctimonious person...

Uurvashi is one among the four celestial chief maidens, apsara-s, namely, Uurvashi, Rambha, ṃenaka and 
Tiolottama. When Vishnu was in His meditation all the other apsara-s came to Him to disturb His meditation. 
Knowing that, Vishnu gave birth to this Uurvashi from his things. Thus, she is called the one who came 
from thighs <em>ūruḥ </em>&#39;from thighs...&#39; and this word is defined as <em>uru vaṣṭi </em>&#39;muchly,

are incorporated in the following simple verses:</p>

as an institution. The domestic quarrelling, bickering, nagging... all these persists in every home, 
but making a mountain of that anthill, will eventually lead to the collapse of that institution of marriage. 
No doubt, Seetha is a nagging, quarrelling, and sermonising, tongue-lashing woman but if it comes to 
her husband, she is undone without him, though he lost his empire, roaming in forests, eating trash 
etc., and yet she does not depart from her pledge to the institution of marriage.</p>
