<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Vali recovers from his swoon and gives his parting messages to Sugreeva and Angada. He also gives his miraculous pendant, given by his
father Indra, to Sugreeva and asks him to assume authority of Kishkindha kingdom, for he won it in this fight. Angada is advised to conduct
appropriately for he is becoming a father-less son now. Then Vali breathes his last to pave the way for Seetha's search.</p>

as proposed by Hanuma. Next, Sugreeva is the next best choice for the kingship, rather than Angada, and a younger brother and also as a one-time
prince regent. In either way the dying Vali is keeping his nobility high up, as an unrivalled champion and even as an elderly brother.</p>

hand and started to quarrel for her wifedom. Then the elderly sages and gods intervened and decided that one who held her by her right hand is her
husband and the other who held her by her left hand is her father. Thus Sushena is said to have become the father of Tara.</p>

astrology. These two are neither gods, nor demons, not planets. At the time of churning ṃilky Ocean one demon had a share of amṛita, the Divine
nectar. But on noticing it the Sun and ṃoon report that episode to Vishnu. Vishnu slits that demon's throat with his disc. Then that Rahu became a
two-piece entity, one with head, named as Rāhu and the other with trunk - tail, named as Ketu. Because Sun and ṃoon reported the wrongdoing of this
two-piece entity, that entity prays to subsist on eating away Sun and ṃoon. That prayer is granted subject to condition, that this eating will be
done only occasionally. Those are the occasions of eclipses of either Sun or ṃoon. Recent astrology gave names to these two entities as 'Dragon with
Head' is Rāhu and the 'Dragon with Tail' is Ketu.</p>

menace, that too from bad monkeys. In Patiala's ṃotibagh Bir Zoo there is penitentiary for primates where all bad monkeys are jailed without parole,
and there will be a signboard, asking visitor to not to go nearby the enclosure, because it will be dangerous. Each of its inmates is caught, even
across Punjab and other places, when that monkey is destroying property, thieving and attacking people and creating havoc. Hence monkey menace is
something different from monkey havoc. Throughout India we have monkey menace, which is very frequently beamed by Discovery and National Geography
channels, but it is rarely said about bad monkeys. Killing a monkey, however bad it is, is a taboo and sustaining its havoc is an altogether
unbearable affair. Now that the bad monkey of Ramayana is eliminated, search for Seetha is possible.</font></p>
