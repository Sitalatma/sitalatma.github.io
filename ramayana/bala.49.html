<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Ahalya is redeemed from her curse when Rama enters their hermitage. 
			Vishvamitra while continuing the narration of the legend of Ahalya asks 
			Rama to enter her hermitage where Ahalya is living unseen by anybody. 
			When once Rama steps into that hermitage she manifests herself from 
			her accursed invisible state. She emerges with her divine form and accords 
			guestship to Rama and Lakshmana. Sage Gautama also arrives at this juncture 
			to accept his depurated wife Ahalya.</p>

Indra is a position assigned to some high-souled being on acquiring considerable 
merit. He functions as a CEO of the universe, maintaining seasons, rains, thunders, 
thunderbolts, crops, earthquakes, and every aspect of nature, whether they are good 
or bad for us. If any Vedic-ritual were performed, this Indra would be too happy, 
as he and his deputies like Rain-god, Fire-god, Air-god, et al., will receive many 
oblations from that ritual. But if it is <em>tapas</em> &#39;the practise of asceticism, 
penance, or ascesis&#39; by single sage, Indra will be highly perturbed. Usually sages 
will be practising this ascesis for attainment of higher abodes of Brahma, Vishnu, 
or Shiva. Some practise this to overthrow present Indra and try ascending to his 
position, or to attain immortality and thereby rout out Indra, as with the case 
of Ravana. When that practise is about to materialise, Indra sends his agents, like 
voluptuous celestial beauties, namely the apsara-s, to infatuate those sages with 
their beauty. Once the sage&#39;s concentration fails, his practise becomes futile. 
Thus, Indra retains his present position. Here, though Sage Gautama did not practise 
his ascesis for Indra&#39;s post, Indra had to hinder it in his own apprehension, and 
when the fury of Gautama is incited, Gautama&#39;s practise also failed and he had to 
redo his ascesis until he overcomes his passions. Thus, this &#39;causing hindrance&#39; 
is a divine-act as proclaimed by Indra to other gods. In doing such &#39;divine-acts&#39; 
Indra will also be maligned, for which the higher gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, 
or other higher beings will come to his rescue.</p>

The &#39;manes&#39; are the deified souls of dead ancestors. It is customary to offer 
un-castrated or unmutilated animals in sacrifices to please gods or departed souls. 
Presently some humans have offered such an un-castrated ram to manes and the manes 
are about to enjoy it. But the gods have come and Agni, the Fire-god, is asking 
them to part with such an offering, for the sake of Indra. And when the manes were 
hesitating to go against the existing rules of ritual, then Agni, the Fire-god, 
is amending those rules and he is saying a boon-like proclamation. &#39;From now, the 
manes can enjoy even a castrated ram, if offered by humans on earth, and in turn 
the manes shall afford plentiful benefits of undiminished value to those offerers, 
namely humans...&#39;</p>

<em>21. mahātapāḥ</em> = great ascetic - Gautama; <em>mahātejā</em> = great-resplendent

Even that great-resplendent Gautama is heartened when he reunited with Ahalya after 
a long, long a time, and that sage customarily reverenced Rama for actualising his 
solemn utterance, and that great-ascetic Gautama continued his ascesis together 
with Ahalya. [1-49-21]</p>

Ahalya - a ṃyth or a reality?</h3>

The legend of Ahalya is viewed from many viewpoints, because it is unclear whether 
she is a humanly lady or a divine entity, or a tract of land.</p>

The atheists, rather materialists, in their translation of Ramayana take this Ahalya, 
according to their viewpoint, as an uncultivable tract of land by saying that is
<font color="#C3003A">a + halya</font> un, ploughed...land&#39; Thereby Rama rendered 
it as a cultivable land in the course of his socio-economic reforms. There are many 
other instances in relating these mythical accounts of Ramayana to the earthly plane. 
Another instance is <font color="#C3003A">lavaṇa asura samhāra</font> elimination 
of Saline Demon...&#39; and Rama&#39;s elimination of this demon is taken as treatment of 
saline oceanic water as potable waters...&#39;</p>

When the mythology is touched upon, it says that Ahalya is lying there as a stone 
and by the touch of Rama&#39;s foot she regained her divinely human form. This is not 
evident in Valmiki Ramayana. The idea of petrifaction of Ahalya is brought in from
<em>Padma Purāna</em> which says: <em>sā tataḥ tasya rāmasya pāda sparshanāt 
mahātmanḥ | abhūt surūpā vanitā samākrāntā mahā shilā ||</em> by the touch 
of the feet of that great souled Rama, she was manifest as a divine damsel, getting 
rid of her stone-shape...&#39; Further, there will be an exchange of words between Indra 
and Brahma in Uttara Kanda of Ramayana, and there this episode of Ahalya recurs. 
At that place Brahma defines <em>hala</em> as - distorted shape...&#39; and <em>a halya</em> 
is one with an impeccable beauty...&#39; Besides the above, Indra will be usually addressed 
as <em>sahasra aksha</em> - thousand eyed one...&#39; and behind this legend, there 
is another legend, saying that Gautama&#39;s curse to Indra is: since you delighted 
with Divine Ahalya, who is crafted by Brahma, in carnal pleasures, let there be 
thousand carnally vaginal apertures on your body...&#39; Then that Indra is agitated 
for such an appearance, pleads for mercy. Then, the curse is amended saying &#39;instead 
of vaginal apertures, the apertures on your body will look like eyes...&#39; thus Indra 
became <em>sahasra aksha.</em></p>

F. ṃax ṃuller records in his History of Sanskrit Literature&#39; the commentary of Kumārila 
Bhatt, yet another ancient commentator on Ramayana. &quot;In the same manner, if it is 
said the Indra was the seducer of Ahalya. This does not imply that the God Indra 
committed such a crime, but Indra means the Sun and Ahalya the night, from [the 
words] <em>ahaḥ</em> the &#39;day&#39; and <em>lil</em> the &#39;night&#39;; and as the night is 
seduced and ruined by the sun of the morning, there is Indra called the paramour 
of Ahalya.&quot;</p>

Dharmākūtam views this as <em>pātityam, patita</em> falling from practise of 
virtuousness&#39; Such women are said to be accepted by men after making their amends 
for their faults. <em>tathā svarūpa nāsham kṛitvā vāyu bhakṣha ityādi vayonūrpa
