he eliminated Pramāthi, and filled the bulging eyes of Sthulāksha with arrows by which Sthulāksha 
is killed and fell down onto ground like a burly tree with its broad branches. Then still infuriated 
Rama forthwith eliminated the five thousand hench-demons of Dūshana with five thousand arrows, and 
thus he led them to the residence of Time-god, namely the hell. [3-26-20b, 21, 22, 23a]</p>

The words <em>viṭapi</em> &#39;a tree with branches and twigs...&#39; and <em>druma</em> &#39;a tree&#39; in general. 
Though they are similar to give the general meaning of a tree, they are juxtaposed taking the <em>viṭapi</em> 
as the adjective of the word <em>druma</em>. This is not exactly synonymic usage, but a shade of difference 
is available in both words. Readers may please refer to the excellent book of Dr. Satya Vrat, The Ramayana 
- A Linguistic Study.</p>

The last compound in the second foot indicates that Rama is also remaining as one among the army of 
Khara, which is found irksome to some scholars. They said that the older mms contain the expression
<em>hata sheṣau nishāacarā</em> instead of <em>rāmaḥ ca ripu sūdanaḥ</em> taking the finishing line 
from the opening words of next verse. Otherwise, it can be said &#39;on the side of Khara only two demons, 
namely Khara and Trishira are remaining, and on the other side Rama is remaining...&#39; as given here. 
But it is said to be inappropriate, because Rama cannot be grouped with the killable side. Further,
