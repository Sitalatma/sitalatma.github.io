<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama and Ravana confront each other with various arrows and missiles. ṃeanwhile, Lakshmana joins the fight and chops off Ravana's bow
with his arrows. Vibhishana also fights and kills Ravana's horses. Lakshmana rescues Vibhishana, when a spear is hurled on him by Ravana. Then,
Ravana throws a spear on Lakshmana. As it penetrates Lakshmana's bossom, Lakshmana falls down unconscious. Rama hurls hails of arrows on Ravana from
his flaming bow. Ravana takes to his heels out of fear.</p>
