<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Sage Valmiki goes to River Tamasa for a bath and sees a couple of birds, of which a hunter 
kills one. Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, 
of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, 
the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic 
of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him.</p>

		<p class="comment">
		This verse has many comports of which a few are given hereunder:</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		This verse is taken as <em>ma~NgalaacaraNa</em> to Ramayana, 
		for any epic has to have <em>ma~Ngala aadiini; ma~Ngala madhyaani; ma~Ngala antaani</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		A good pious beginning, pious middle and pious ending. </p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		Because this verse has the letter
		<em>maa</em> at its start and <em>maa</em> <em>is</em> <em>lakShmii vaacaka</em> 
		in Sanskrit. It is <em>aadi varNaH</em> The first letter&nbsp; <em>loka maataa maa 
		ramaa ma~Ngala devataa</em> thus <em>amara kosha</em> says for Goddess Lakshmi.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		<em>maa</em><span class="em">= Goddess Lakshmi; <em>niShaada</em></span>= Oh! Vishnu [ for Goddess 
		Lakshmi resides in the heart of Vishnu - <em>niShadiiti asmin iti niShaada</em>
		<span class="em">]; <em>yat</em></span><em> </em>= by which act; <em>krounca midhunaat</em> = the couple of 
		demons, namely Ravana and Mandodari; <em>kaama mohitam</em>= that impassioned one and stole 
		Seetha; <em>ekam</em>= that one, Ravana; <em>avadhii</em>= you killed; by that act of yours;&nbsp;
		<em>shashvatiisamaa</em>= everlasting for ages; <em>pratiShTaam</em>= divine sanctity; <em>
		tvam agama</em>= you, get.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		&quot;Oh, the abode of Goddess Lakshmi, namely oh, Vishnu, by which act of your killing one male demon named 
		Ravana, who in his passion abducted Seetha, and thus you eradicated the vice from the earth, 
		for that you get an everlasting divine sanctity, as Rama, for ages to come.&quot;</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		2] Next <em>niSaada</em> is attributable to Ravana, because he is the one who tortures others for 
		his benefit. <em>itaraam saadayati piiDayati iti niSaada</em> thus: Oh! Ravana; <em>krounch 
		midhunaat</em>= from the couple, say Rama and Seetha, who are flying from forest to forest like nest-less birds; <em>
		ekam</em>= one is, Seetha is; <em>avadhii</em> =you almost killed her by your torture of abducting 
		her;
		<em>pratiSTaam</em>= your glory in Lanka, at its zenith, as per the kindness of Brahma; <em>ma agama</em>= 
		never get, hereafter. But this declination is not held right, for it is like a curse, <em>shaapa</em>, 
		and no epic starts with a curse.
		</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		3] Next, this verse is said holding Rama in the perspective. Sage Narada gave the details of the 
		legend to Sage Valmiki because Brahma ordered that the legend of Rama is to be recorded. But 
		Ramayana is full of pathos, <em>karuNa shoka rasa prathaana</em>. If it is to be penned the writer 
		too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks, Rama, say 
		Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like <em>kiraataarjuniiya</em> 
		etc., to test the capability of Valmiki in narrating pathos, and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted 
		immediately and Vishnu&#39;s test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Vishnu / Rama 
		gets a curse like separation from wife, as below.
		</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		<em>nishaada</em>= oh, tribal: Rama to Valmiki / Vishnu to mythology; for your killing one bird of 
		the couple, to the misery of the female one; <em>shaashvatii</em> = as long as you live on this 
		earth;
		<em>samaaH pratiSTaam</em>= togetherness, with your wife; <em>ma agama</em>= do not get.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		Oh! Rama, as long as you are on earth, you do not get the love of being together with your wife, 
		because you killed one from the bird couple... and you have to live with your wife departed [to 
		Lanka,] come again, and then departed [to forests.]</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		But this is differed statement, since Vishnu does not require any personal testing of the 
		capabilities of the writer of Ramayana. Brahma will look after such literary things.
		</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		4] The generally accepted meaning of this verse is this. Any epic&#39;s gist is to be said at the start 
		or, at its commencement 
		<span class="em">---</span> <em>kaavya artha suucanam kascin 
		aadyaam eva niruupyate</em><span class="em">--- </span>
		<font face="Translit 98" size="3" color="#CC0000">&nbsp;</font>Thus, the above verse included the meaning of whole of the epic, 
		Ramayana.
		</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		i] <em>maa niSaada</em>= Goddess Lakshmi and Vishnu. Their marriage in their incarnations as Rama 
		and Seetha, and Ramayana depicts this in <em>Bala Kanda</em>.
		</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		ii] <em>pratiSTaam tvam agama</em>= renown, you get, by following your father&#39;s orders you have 
		repaired to forests, without any political upheaval, thus get an everlasting renown as an obliging 
		son <em>Ayodhya Kanda</em>.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		iii] <em>shashavatii samaa</em>= by dwelling in forest and eradicating demons and helping the saints 
		and sages thus, you achieve an everlasting praise <em>Aranaya Kanda</em>.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		iv] <em>krounchayoH</em>= from the [atrocious] couple;
		<font face="Translit 98" size="3" color="#CC0000">k</font><span class="em">--</span> <em>krunca 
		gati kauTilyaa alpii bhaavayoH</em>; the 
		atrocious Vali, and Tara couple; <em>ekam kaama mohitam </em>= one, passion, filled, i.e., Vali; 
		avadhii= you killed, you killed Vali Kishkindha Kanda.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		v] <em>krouncha mithunaat</em>= from the couple of lovely passionate birds here Rama and Seetha; <em>
		niSaada</em> that ruffian Ravana, <em>kaama mohitam</em> lustfully, <em>ekam </em>one [i.e., 
		Seetha];
		<em>avadhii </em>= almost killed, i.e., her residing in Lanka is as good as death <em>Sundara Kanda</em>.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		vi] <em>krouncha mithunaat</em> = from the atrocious, couple Ravana and Mandodari; <em>ekam avadhii
		</em>one Ravana, you killed <em>Yuddha Kanda</em>.</p>
		
		<p class="comment">
		vii] <em>kaama mohitam</em>= by desire, fascinated [ <em>kama</em> also means a longing, desire, let 
		alone lusting]; Seetha is fascinated by her desire to see sage&#39;s wives in uttara Ramayana and thus 
		she is sent to forests through Lakshmana. Hence seventh canto, <em>uttara Ramayana</em> is also 
		suggested.

Comment: Brahma is one in the Trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Brahma is pictured to 
have four faces, each representing one Veda, where Vedas are four in number. He is the creator 
of worlds, while Vishnu maintains them, and Shiva dissolute them. The concert of Brahma is 
Saraswati, the presiding deity of speech, who was earlier requested by Brahma to be on the 
tongue of Valmiki to utter the poem, [as at 1-2-15] as an intuition to Valmiki. Thus Brahma 
now arrives to ordain Valmiki to author Ramayana.</p>
