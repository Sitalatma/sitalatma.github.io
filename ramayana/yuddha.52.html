<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Dhumraksha along with army attacks the monkeys. A tumultuous battle ensued between the demons and the monkeys. The battle reached
frightful proportions in that both the monkeys and demons were killed in large numbers. When Dhumraksha pounced on Hanuman, the latter shattered
Dhumraksha's chariot to pieces. Lifting his mace, Dhumraksha fights with Hanuman, who in turn hits him on his head and kills him.</p>
