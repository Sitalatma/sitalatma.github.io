<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 3<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Hanuma, at the behest of Sugreeva, approaches Rama and Lakshmana in the guise of an ascetic. The reason 
to change his original form to that of a sanyasi is that, the intruders in this area Rama and Lakshmana 
appear in a self-contradictory personage. By their body built, striking features, wielding armoury they 
look like kings or emperors. But when it comes to their dress and hairdo, they are almost like hermits. 
Sugreeva is well aware of political milieu and enemy&#39;s tactics, and thus asked Hanuma not to approach 
them in his original monkey form in earlier chapter. Equally well, Rama and Lakshmana doubt the entry 
of an ascetic i.e., Hanuma in that guise, into this uninhabited place, and they wait cautiously till 
Hanuma reveals himself. From here up to Sundara Kanda, Hanuma&#39;s words and actions are weighted, and 
need an in-depth study. In this episode, what all Hanuma says is drawn from scriptures and political 
science, and what all Rama analyses Hanuma, by way of Hanuma&#39;s expressiveness, is relevant to scriptures, 
i.e., Veda-s. In mythology, Hanuma is taken as the <em>veda vedānga pārangataḥ</em>, 
knower of all Vedas, and their subsidiary scriptures, <em>nava vyākarana panditaḥ</em>, 
scholar in nine schools of grammars, <em>buddhimata variṣṭaḥ</em> , cleverest of 
the clever. He is the supreme scholar, teacher, and the cleverest.</p>

ṃindful of the words of noble-souled Sugreeva, Hanuma took his flight from ṃt. Rishyamuka to where Raghavā-s are. [4-3-1]</p>

<p class="tat">
Casting off his monkey's semblance Air-god's son Hanuma attained the persona of an ascetic, for that monkey is incredulous in mind
about Raghava-s. [4-3-2]</p>
<p class="comment">Sugreeva doubted Rama and Lakshmana to be the mercenaries sent by his elder brother Vali, for kings of that nature will always be
on hunt for their enemies. Hence he ordered Hanuma not to approach them in his original persona that is of a mighty monkey, c.f. 4-2-24. This is the
reason why he chose the form of ascetic, thinking that nobody tells a lie to an ascetic, and thus he wanted to gain information in an ascetic's form,
but futile is his effort. Rama or Lakshmana will go on listening to what Hanuma says, without any reply. Hanuma himself is vexed at their silence and
he has to come out of his guise to reveal his original form, as at 4-3-19.</p>

āyatāḥ ca suvṛttāḥ ca bāhavaḥ parighopamāḥ || 4-3-14<br>

"Also lengthy are your hands, and spherical are your shoulders similar to clubs... they are worthy for decoration with every kind of

<p class="comment">Here in the verse plural number is used for hands, <em>āyatāḥ, bāhavaḥ, 
parighāḥ</em>, whereas so far, dual number, <em>dvivachana</em> is used to describe any two. The 
ancient commentators take this as many hands, more than two, as opposite to other dual numbered 
wording. For this it is said that since Lakshmana is a right hand to Rama, Hanuma sees a 
three-handed god in Rama. But Hanuma is talking to both Rama and Lakshmana; there shall be two 
deities with two hands each. The accepted phenomenon is that, Hanuma as a true devotee has seen the 
fourhanded Vishnu in Rama. This is according to Govindaraja. Next, the arms of Rama are of 
protective nature to the friendly ones. <em>āyātāḥ</em>, lengthily ones - they can be stretched 
to any extent, and on the other hand, anything can depend on them, as in <em>yopām āyatanam 
veda...</em> and this su vrittāḥ, round like the serpent&#39;s hoods, or body builder&#39;s clubs, is to 
tell that no one can near them. Thus, the spherical universe can depend on the spherical shoulders 
of Rama. Thus Hanuma is reminding Rama of his wild-boar incarnation where the whole world is lifted 
on his snout from waters. The word <em>parighaḥ</em>, is to say that those spherical shoulders can 
remove difficulties of those who adore them. The <em>parighaḥ</em> in simple terms means, clubs, 
bludgeon, or ancient dumbbell unlike the present day dumbbells of gym, but the word is deciphered to 
be <em>pari gha</em> fully, removing, or fully, falling to one&#39;s lot. That is, here these shoulders 
are mighty to eliminate Vali and these hands if shook by Sugreeva in friendship, Sugreeva&#39;s miseries 
will be removed completely.</p>

<p class="comment">A monkey cannot be teased this far, for it will show its teeth, if exceeded. Hanuma is vexed with their silence. So far he has
been talking all flattering words, which he has drawn from many scriptures, i.e., scriptures. Their apparels and hair tufts are like those of sages
and hermits, along with their self-contradictory resemblance as would-have-been emperors, and their mighty weaponry, and every other thing he said
are the quotes from lakshana shātra, the scripture that prescribes the qualities of great emperors. This is what the other two listeners are
assessing about the questioner also. In the midst of this unpopulated thick forest, some ascetic comes in, talks at length, that too without offence
to the scriptures, is the doubt of those two brothers. This particular questioner is not definitely any ascetic or sage, because he is roaming in
deep forests, rather than around some villages where he may get some charities. And also that, generally ascetics will talk, only when they are
talked to, but this one with some purpose behind, is almost pestering to reveal the identity of the intruders. Hence the brothers took Hanuma to be
another demon or anyone sent by somebody, for they already knew about the Vali-Sugreeva episode. Apart from this, Rama is following his own Imperial
protocol of assessing the person approaching on his own, who is talking like this one, and who has high knowledge of all the scriptures. This
analysis, Rama gives to Lakshmana after a few more verses. For now, Hanuma had to yield to high resistance from those two brothers, and is going to
reveal himself, with a come-what-may attitude.</p>

<p class="comment">From hereon Rama&#39;s analysis of Hanuma is depicted. In Rig Veda every letter has 
too many phonetically deflected variations, in many ways to mean many things. It is practically 
impossible to contain that knowledge, unless the recitalist has complete control over it. Hence the 
word, <em>vinīta</em> , &#39;well trained&#39; is used. In Yajurveda many <em>anuvāka</em>-s or passages 
occur recursively, with different utilisation. Remembering not to mix one with the other is a 
difficult process. Hence the recitalist has to have enormous remembrance. In Sāmaveda the pitch and 
duration of the rendering is of high importance, as such it requires a scholarly bent to control 
vocal notes. The three words, <em>vinaya</em>, schooling; <em>dhāraṇa</em>, remembrance and <em>
vedana</em> knowledge are required to each of the above Veda-s. Atharva Veda, on the other hand, has 
no recital performance other than the above. Hence, it is said, is not quoted by Rama. Hanuma said 
&#39;you two are eligible to rule the earth&#39; as at 4-3-15, which tantamount to the quote <em>brhamā vā 
idam ekaeva agra āsīt...</em> from Rigveda aitereya. Next he said that you are deities inhuman 
form at 4-3-13, which has its bearing on the Yajurveda quote <em>ajāyamāno bahudhā vijāyate...</em> 
Then Rama is said having lotus-petal like eyes, at 4-3-11, taking clue from cchandogya of Sāmaveda,
<em>myathākapyāsam punDarīkam evākshiṇī...</em>. Hence these utterances of Hanuman are said to 
have direct base in the Veda-s.</p>

Earlier Vedic knowledge of Hanuma is analysed. Now his knowledge of grammar, the essential part of 
Vedic learning is analysed. Without the knowledge of subsidiary scriptures of Veda-s, like, <em>
vyākarana, nirukta, sikhsha,chandas</em> , the study of Vedas and its ancillaries itself is futile. 
Reading and reciting the Vedic hymns is of no use in practical life, for the knowledge learnt 
thereon is to be implemented in society. A simple recitalist is known as <em>chā.ndasa</em> 
orthodox fellow, while the user of that knowledge for the good of society is <em>vyavahārta</em> 
practical fellow. Hence Hanuma is implementing the grammar and training received originally as a 
Vedic scholar, because he is a practical one.&nbsp;</p>

<p  class="comment">The research scholars point out that these many 
verses are not there in some ancient manuscripts and only the following verses are available. Even the 
tailor-made Baroda edition ends at verse 4-3-27. The above aspects of Rama&#39;s analysis etc., is available 
in the Eastern and Gorakhpur and other untailored manuscripts. There is an extensive commentary on these 
so-called extra verses, rendered in a rare commentary Dharmākūtam dating back to 1600&#39;s, and even 
in earlier commentaries. The verses found in ancient manuscripts are said to be this one and half stanzas:</p>

<p  class="comment">Taking clue of the last foot, namely
<em>vākyajnam</em> etc., and to glorify Hanuma through the tongue of Rama, these 
verses from 4-3-28 to 4-3-35, are said to be crafted later, without throwing light on when and where. 
Rama is going to give <em>āchārya</em> , Teacher status to Hanuma to educate the 
innate soul - Seetha in Lanka - about the Almighty. So, to receive that status, according to Vaishnavaite 
stipulates, a guru should possess certain qualities like:</p>

<p class="comment">
A teacher is to be well-equipped with all Veda-s, a devotee of Vishnu, always purified by hymnal purity, 
devotion to his own teacher, knower of mythologies, in particular, and one who is endowed with these 
qualities alone is called the Guru.</p>

<p  class="comment">And Hanuma is one such according to popular belief, 
though not from the viewpoints of researches. It is therefore unclear whether the modern day researchers 
are right or the ancient commentators.</p>
