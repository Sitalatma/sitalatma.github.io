<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 12<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Rama to imbue confidence in Sugreeva hurtles his arrow that penetrates seven sala trees and also the subterranean planes of earth and
returns into his quiver. Sugreeva obliging the prowess of Rama submits himself to Rama, who encourages Sugreeva to challenge Vali for a duel.
Accordingly a duel ensues wherein Vali assaults Sugreeva and chases him off. Battered and belittled, Sugreeva implores upon Rama why he did not come
to his rescue. Rama apologetically states that he could not make out difference between the two brothers for they are alike. Rama asks Sugreeva to
wear a garland and again challenge Vali, so with that identification of garland he could aim his arrow at the other dueller. Again they all advance
towards Kishkindha for the duel with Vali.</p>

<p class="comment">
This word <em>bhātrgandhin</em> is a unique expression for &#39;name sake,&#39; and is said to be<em> 
anarthaka bhātṛi vyapadesham</em>where <em>an+arthaka</em> is not, meaningful - meaningless;
<em>bhātṛi</em> brotherhood&#39;s; <em>vyapadesham</em> nomenclature. &#39;</p>

<p class="comment">A meaningless nomenclature called a brother&#39; for that brother who has 
no brotherliness for his brothers. Sugreeva do have such a brother Vali, from whom he got the redolence 
of cruelty alone, but not any brotherliness. Rama Tilaka.</p>

<p class="comment">Here Vali is compared with the dusking sun, who is also said to fall back onto the sky before his total dusking into western side.
Some say 'because Vali is going to see the dusk of his day this simile is suitable,' while some say that 'Vali is not going to see his dusk of the
day now itself hence this is unsuitable.' And some other older mms, contain this simile as
