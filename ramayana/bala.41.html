<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Amshuman&#39;s search for horse reveals that Kapila rendered his paternal-uncles 
			to ashes. When he wanted to offer water oblation as obsequies to their 
			souls he did not find water. Then Garuda, the Eagle-vehicle of Vishnu 
			and maternal uncle of Amshuman advises him to get River Ganga onto earth 
			whereby the souls are cleansed and they go to heaven. Amshuman reports 
			the same to King Sagara, but Sagara not finding any way to get River 
			Ganga onto earth departs to heaven at the end of his time.</p>
