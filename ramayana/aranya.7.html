<h3>chapter [Sarga] 7</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama arrives at the hermitage of Sage Suteekshna, as directed by Sage Sharabhanga in 
the previous chapter and asks the sage to show a place to dwell. Suteekshna asks Rama to stay at his 
own hermitage, which has no other problems than the wild animals that come in herds and make blaring 
noises. Rama wishes to kill those animals that hamper the tranquillity of hermits living therein, but 
having observed the kindness of Suteekshna towards those wild animals, however disturbing they may be, 
Rama refrains to kill them, and would like to go to any other place than this. They spend that night 
there.</p>

after each bath on this impure body. So they stop taking outward bath and concentrate on cleansing the 
inner space.</p>

meritorious and establishes a selflessness of the devotee. Even in any daily worship it will be concluded

while some others read it as animals. If they are just deer, the word <em>a + hatvā</em> , without 
killing, is of no use, for deer is not a carnivorous animal to kill someone. In other versions, this 
verse is a complete recast telling that herds of great size animals come and blare, but do not kill 
or fear any one. Even if it were so, this sage has got a tolerance for them too. And if some latent 
meaning is picked up, the large herds of deer, moving as they like in this hermitage, are said to be 
&#39;luring&#39; the sages, <em>lobhayitbvā</em>. A presumption arises here. This must be the same &#39;lure&#39; Seetha 
got on seeing Golden Deer. But Rama raises his bow and arrow to kill these animals that disturb tranquillity 
of hermitage, whether it be deer or other blaring wild animals. So Rama&#39;s fury must be at the &#39;luring 
deer&#39;, say Golden Deer, but not at ordinary deer. Thus this usage of &#39;deer and lure&#39; may be taken as
<em>lakshaṇa</em> for <em>lakshita</em> of Ramayana.</p>

<div id="btn5" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">It may not be construed that Seetha is served with no food, by taking the wording 
that &#39;two of best men are served food&#39; by the sage. It is usual for the Indian women to take food after 
their husbands or other dependents take it first, then all womenfolk in the house join together to have 
their meal, [for a long time...of course, with their unending chit-chatting...]</p>

<font color="#B3003A">āscharya rāmayana</font> , another traditional rendering of this epic, it is 
said that Rama, while staying at this hermitage when night advanced, went out of the hermitage and killed 
all those animals. Not the above mentioned deer, but very big, blaring animals. The thrust of his arrows 
made the carcasses of those massive animals fall before the demon Kabandha. Kabandha is a cursed angle 
and will be released of his curse later by Rama. This Kabandha has no body parts below his chest, but 
has long hands with which he captures his prey that comes within the ambit of his long and strong hands. 
Kabandha is thus fed upon the kill of Rama, because Kabandha is a keynote character in giving information 
to Rama, and he is to be kept alive till such time. But all this is unknown to other in-mates of the 
hermitage, including Seetha. The next morning Rama, in a personal conversation with Seetha, reveals 
what he has done during the previous night, to her surprise and praise.</font></p>
