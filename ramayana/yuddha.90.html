<h3> VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of
<br>
chapter [Sarga] 90<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Indrajit goes back to Lanka and brings another chariot with him. He attacks the monkeys severely. The monkeys seek refuge in
Lakshmana. Indrajit and Lakshmana continue a fierce battle with their bow and arrows. Lakshmana destroys Indrajit's chariot. Indrajit strikes three
arrows in Lakshmana's forehead and Lakshmana strikes five arrows on Indrajit's face. When Indrajit strikes Vibhishana with arrows, Vibhishana kills
Indrajit's horses. Fitting a missile presided over by Indra the lord of celestials, Lakshmana addressed a prayer on Rama and discharged it towards
Indrajit. Indrajit's head gets chopped off and falls to the ground. Witnessing Indrajit's death, all the monkey-chiefs, Vibhishana, Hanuma and
Jambavan applaud Lakshmana.</p>
