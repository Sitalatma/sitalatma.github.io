Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Valmiki composed twenty four thousand verses and taught them to Lava and Kusha, the sons of 
Rama and Seetha. The two youngsters sing the ballad among the assemblages of sages and saints, 
and win laurels. Rama on seeing the boys singing on the streets and king&#39;s ways of Ayodhya, 
brings them to his palace, and summons all his brothers and ministers to listen to the ballad. 
Rama himself is put to the turmoil, for the ballad sung by these youngsters narrates the legend 
of Seetha. But he himself collecting his calm, Rama paid his attention to listen the &#39;Legend 
of Seetha&#39; <span class="smRṣ">sithāyaḥ charitam mahān</span>as Valmiki calls Ramayana.</p>

<p class="tat">
Sage Valmiki said Ramayana in twenty four thousand verses, in six hundred chapters, in six 
books, likewise an end-piece too. [1-4-2]</p>

<p class="comment">
The twenty-four are the letters in <em>Gayatri</em> hymn. Ramayana&#39;s scheming is based on 
Gayatri hymn and for this: <span class="smRṣ">"atra catur vi~Nshati sa~Nkhyo uktyā catur vi~Nshati akṣhara

grahaṇāt api gayatrī rūpatvam sūcitam - dharmākūtam</span></p>

<p class="comment">
There is a controversy about the number of verses and cantos. If Uttara Ramayana, otherwise 
called <em>abhudaya kānDa</em> , is ascribed to Valmiki, the cantos are seven and chapters 
are about 649 and verses are about 24,253. But some verses and chapters are deleted for standardization 
of Ramayana as per this verse and they contain 560 chapters and 24,00 verses only. Some argue 
that when it is said 24, 000 verses are there, it does not actually a mathematical assertion, 
like the calculation of <em>mahā yuga</em> -s and <em>manvantara</em> -s, and as one would 
give a reply to his age as 30 years, or 60 years, but not as 29 years, 6 months, seven days 
or so... In furthering that standardization affair, some said that even this canto, Bala kānda 
is not authored by Valmiki. It is not clear as of now when the pundits can decide as to which 
is standard and which is not.</p>

<p class="comment">
The transcendental aspect of Ramayana and its content is explained in 18 terms by ancient 
commentator Govindaraja. 1] Rama&#39;s Absoluteness, <em>paramātma tattva</em> ; 2] Ideation 
to know Him, <em>upāya</em> ; 3] Dedication in Him, <em>kainkarya</em> ; 4] Human aspect,
<em>puruṣākāra</em> ; 5] Diviner, <em>adhikāra</em> ; 6] Resolve in God, <em>adhikāra 
pāratantrya</em> ; 7] God&#39;s resolve in Dedicate, <em>bhagavat pāratantrya</em> ; 8] Knowledge 
of five ṃeanings, <em>artha pancaka GYāna</em> ; 9] Self-denial, <em>akincinatvam</em> ; 
10] Teacher selecting, <em>ācārya varaṇam</em> ; 11] Climax, <em>autkaṇṭhata</em> ; 12] 
Behaviour, <em>pravartana</em> ; 13] Residence, <em>vāsa sthāna</em> ; 14] Two Narayana 
hymns, <em>nārāyaṇa mantra dvaya</em> ; 15] Gayatri, <em>Gayatri</em> hymn; 16] Negating 
negative-thinking, <em>durvicāra parihāra</em> ; 17] negating Love for Living, <em>samsāra 
jihāsa</em> ; 18] 64 Divinely Arts, <em>catuṣaṣṭi kalamayatva</em> . Of them we take up the15thGayatri.</p>

<p class="comment">
The identification of <em>Gayatri</em> with Ramayana scheme is explained in many ways. By
<em>tat savitṛi</em> the features and attributes of the Absolute as per narrations in Bala 
Kanda. <em>vareṇya</em> by the narration of Absolute&#39;s attributes in Ayodhya and Kishkindha 
kānda-s, and adherents like Lakshmana, Bharata, Sugreeva take shelter in Him here only.
<em>bharga</em> is identified as per the description of resplendence of The Divine as envisaged 
by the sages and hermits in Aranya Kanda. <em>devasya</em> and in <em>dhīmahi</em> where 
that <em>deva</em> the Divine is explained by Hanuma, not only to Seetha but to all in Sundara 
kanda. <em>hi dhī mahi</em> is as explained in Uttara Kanda, which centers around <em>moksha</em> 
salvation.</p>

<p class="comment">
Seetha&#39;s conduct is the primary aspect and Ravana&#39;s elimination is secondary in the epic of 
Ramayana. <em>poulasthya vadha</em> . Giving one to many names to poem/epics is usual as in
<em>māgha kāvya&#39;</em> which is known as <em>shishupāla vadha</em> whereas it is actually
<em>kṛishṇa carita</em> .</p>

<p class="comment">
The three Indian scale pauses are <em>dṛita, madhyama, vilambita</em> . These though not 
equal but identical to Breve, ṃinim and Quaver of Western classical music. The seven fold 
classifications of swara-s are <em>1] shadja [2] madhyama [3] gāndhara [4] niṣāda [5] ṛiṣabha 
[6] dhaitava [7] pañchama</em> . These are roughly identical to Accelerando, Calando, Decresando, 
Smorzando, Sostentuo, and others of Western classical music.</p>

<p class="tat">
Aesthetics like romance, pathos, comic, fury, fright, valour etc., embodying the epic is sung 
[by Kusha, Lava.] [1-4-9]</p>

<p class="comment">
The Indian categorization of aesthetics <em>rasā</em> -s is in nine emotions. <em>sṛingā</em> 
[romance] <em>hāsa</em> , [humour] <em>shoka</em> , [grief] <em>krodha</em> , [fury]
<em>utsāha</em> , [enthusiasm, bravery] <em>bhaya</em> , [fright] <em>
jugupsa</em> , [disgust] <em>vismaya</em> [amaze.] Again <em>sṛingāra</em> is 
of two kinds - a] <em>sambhoga</em> , [being with his/her partner,] b] <em>vipralamba</em> 
[not being with his/her partner.]</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama&#39;s togetherness with Seetha from Bala Kanda till her abduction is the first category of 
romance. After her departure and until regain, it is second sort of romantic narration. Episodes 
of Surpanakha, Trijata are humorous. Those of Dasharatha, Jatayu etc., are of grievous nature. 
Killing, torturing etc., situations arouse furiousness. Lakshmana, Indrjit and others are 
showing bravery. Seeing ugly demons either in forests or those that surround Seetha is causing 
fright. The very sight of ugly bodied demons like Viradha, Kabandha is creating disgust. Hanuma&#39;s 
leaping ocean, burning Lanka, and the entire Rama-Ravana war are amazing</p>
