<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 66<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Lakshmana reasons with Rama regarding the drastic action Rama is about to take in annihilating the worlds. He says many pithy
references in dissuading Rama. This chapter likens to Bhagavad Gita, as its terse version.</p>

<p class="tat">
While Rama is bewailing like a forlorn as his anguish is scorching him, rendered impoverished with an inanimate heart as a high
passion possessed him, Lakshmana, the son of Sumitra, suppliantly gripped his feet and started to address him. [4-66-1, 2]</p>

Rama is useful to all created, animate, or inanimate beings, inclusive of gods, and the thought of that prime mover to destruct what it is moving, is
self-contradictory. Next, the prime object of ambrosia is to enliven but not to eradicate, thus that thought itself is self-contemptuous. Next, the
very same demons turned destructive from day one, and now if Rama destructs everything, it tantamount to brand Rama to have taken sides with demons.
This is again a self-critical phenomenon of his incarnation. And so on...</p>

hence you return to mortal worlds...' thus Yayāti met with a mischance. Instead of telling as Yayāti, he is said to be the 'son of Nahusha' which
expression suggests disobedience. Once Nahusha made the Seven Sages, the stars in Ursa ṃajor, as the bearers of his palanquin and hastened them
saying sarpa, sarpa... where that word means 'move fast, move fast...' besides its general meaning 'serpent...' Then Sage Agastya curses Nahusha, 'be
like that...' i.e., 'become a serpent...' taking the general meaning of that word. Then Nahusha, though a renowned personality, for he is accursed he
had to fall supine as a big serpent. So Lakshmana is obliquely suggesting Rama, 'you may be a god supreme... but it is in your realm... not on
earth... on earth you have to behave like an earthling... wrecking the system from within is meaningless... have some obedience to the set
order...'</p>

done us in earlier births, to asses their rights or wrongs. And they are indefinite and infirm, because any action we perform it ceases to exist on
its competition. And if we have not performed such an action in last birth, conducive to yield good result in this birth, its fruition is
nonexistent. Thereby we may perhaps muse over our actions basing on the results occurring now. In any case, nonexistent is the fruits of action, may
it be right or wrong, if there is inaction. This is according to Govindaraja. He uses word a dhṛitānām 'infirm' for a dhṛivāṇām 'indefinite'
and Tilaka uses word ca vartate 'also, happens' for pravartate 'will be in existence' and in either way the meaning is the same. <font face=
