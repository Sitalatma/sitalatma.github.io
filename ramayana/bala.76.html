Up to here both these Rama-s are in close quarters with other few present there. After this dialogue, they have moved a 
little away from the throng and facing each other as true combatants. A swordsman or an archer needs an arm-length, or sword-length 
or bow-length, at the least, to swagger his weapon. This place is to be assumed as an isolated place and no one is seeing 
or listening. This scene has an analogy in ṃaha Bharata when Krishna teaches Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. There, it is said, 
that Krishna froze the time to teach all the eighteen chapters, and none among two sides of warring factions are aware of 
Krishna, his teachings, or of Arjuna, excepting Sanjaya, who is placed at a distant place and has seen all with his wisdom-eye. 
Here we have to borrow that wisdom-eye of Sanjaya and see at these two Rama-s and their actions. When their episode is over 
the mist cast around them, rather on our eyes, will be cleared, when Rama returns to his father. This is said in later verses. 
Further more, all the people available there are rendered unconscious at the arrival of Bhārgava Rama, and a few like Dasharatha, 
Vashishta, Rama&#39;s brothers are with senses. So, even if they hear and see this scene, those listeners or seers do no harm 
in revealing Rama&#39;s godhood to world, or in particular to Ravana.</p>

&quot;and, along the same lines Rama also said to have extricated the essential nature of Bhārgava...&#39; The above said &#39;distancing&#39; 
of these two Rama-s has another purpose. Rama has certain innate nature of making his observers enchanted by his very personality. 
Even Ravana looks at him adoringly in the war scene. This apart, his hand has certain ability to extricate the innate nature 
of others, should he lay his hand on them. We rarely see him touching or patting others, except for Seetha, Lakshmana, Hanuma, 
and say a squirrel etc. So, it is believed that, Rama has now expropriated the essential nature of Vishnu from Bhārgava 
Rama, while snatching the bow from his hands. For this Padma Purāna says: <em>iti uktvā devī vaiṣhṇavyā shaktyā tad 
gatāyā saha | jagrāha vaiṣhṇavam cāpam vinayena ca līlayā ||</em>&#39;oh, Devi Parvati, saying so Rama took away the Vishnu&#39;s 
anima from Bhārgava Rama, along with bow of Vishnu, sportily and obediently, too...&#39; Thus, Rama of Dasharatha bade goodbye

Bhārgava-s are Brahman-s and a Brahman cannot be killed <em>brāhmaṇo na hantavya</em> then how Rama is prepared to eliminate 
a Brahman, subjecting himself to the sin called &#39;Brahman killing...&#39; <em>brahma hatyā pātaka...</em> There is no sin in 
eliminating a Brahman who is weaponed and warring. <em>tathā ca bhārate rāja dharme kṛiṣhṇam prati bhīṣhmaḥ - pitrūn

Bharata, shannti parva. &#39;It is no sin to eliminated fathers, grandfathers, teachers, and the like [even if they are Brahman-s,] 
for they are under an illusion, called war...&#39; So said Bhīshma to Krishna and thereby Panadava-s have eliminated Drona, 
Kripa, Ashvaddhāma and suchlike weaponed Brahman-s in war, but not in peace. There are many more such sayings of Bhīshma. 
Here Parashu Rama said that he will give a duel to Rama, hence he is no more a Brahman when he raises a weapon. And he is 
a blood relation of Vishvamitra, and that corner of mercy is not allowing Rama to release the arrow on Parashu Rama.</p>

The debate on the superiority of Vishnu or Shiva may have its own mythological import, but as far as Ramayana is considered, 
the eulogy for Vishnu&#39;s longbow is intended to suggest the all-powerful capacity of Vishnu in eliminating demons and to 
lead the epic to its own goal. Dharmākūtam has to say this: <em>prakṛite - adhikam menire vishṇum - iti rāmāyaṇa vacanam 
tu agre kartavya sakala rākṣhasa vadha hetu bhūta vaiṣhṇava dhanṣhaḥ prāshasta pratipādana param jñyeyam |</em> Hence

Parashu Rama is hastening up Dasharatha Rama to finish business quickly, otherwise the nature of Rama and his incarnation 
will publicized, not by these two Rama-s, but the game watching gods. If these spectators stay for a long time in sky, some

Longbows of Shiva and Vishnu </p>


<div id="btn10" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
The bestowal of Shiva&#39;s bow to the dynasty of Janaka is said variously at various places. In the hermitage 
Vishvamitra it is said that the bow is given in Vedic-ritual <font color="#B3003A">taddhi pūrvam narashreṣṭha 
dattam sadasi daivataiḥ | 1-31-8</font> In the previous chapter it is said that the bow is given in 
the hand of Devarāta <font color="#B3003A">devarātasya rāja ṛiṣeḥ dadau haste sa sāyakam | 1-75-20</font> 
And earlier it is said to be given in Dasksha&#39;s ritual <font color="#B3003A">dakṣa yajña vadhe pūrvam 
dhanuḥ āyamya vīryavān | 1-66-9</font> Seetha says about this to ascetic Lady Anasuya that Rain-god 
gave this to Janaka&#39;s dynasty <font color="#B3003A">mahāyajñe tadā tasya varuṇena mahātmanā | dattam 
dhanur varam prītyā tūṇī ca akṣayya sāyakau Ayodhya II-118.</font> These statements, though not 
self-contradictory, and though they create a little confusion, they all are correct. When Daksha&#39;s Vedic-ritual 
is devastated, Shiva wanted to throw back the useless bow, that was worsted by Vishnu&#39;s bow, on the 
face of gods. But gods fearing for the ire of Shiva requested Shiva to give that bow to Devarāta, on 
their behalf. Shiva gave it to Devarāta as a trust, through Rain-god Varuna, but Shiva did no bequeath 
it. Later Janaka on appeasing gods in Vedic-ritual asked them to leave the bow once for all in Janaka 
Dynasty. Gods have agreed to it. And Rama broke it.</p>

Now Dasharatha Rama gives back the other bow of Vishnu brought by Parashu Rama to the same Rain-god 
Varuna, who is present there at both Rama-s, in the thin air, when the environ is enshrouded by certain 
darkness, and when Rama is last seen with that upraised longbow at 1-76-23, and just before darkness 
is dissipated, Rama gives that bow to Rain-god, according to the first verse in next chapter.</p>

Well known is Krishna&#39;s showing his Cosmic Form <font color="#B3003A">vishva rūpa</font> to Arjuna, 
while teaching Bhagavad Gita in ṃaha Bharata. But that Bharata records Rama&#39;s display of His Cosmic 
form to Parashu Rama, only at this juncture. In ch. 89 of <font color="#B3003A">anushāshanika parva</font> 
of ṃaha Bharata it is said in detail as: <em>pashya mām svena rūpeṇa cakṣhuḥ te vitarāmi aham | tato 
rāma sharīre vai rāma pashyati bhārgavaḥ |ādityān pavamānān rudrān sādhyān ca sa marud gaṇāna 
| pitaro hutāshanaḥ caiva nakṣhatrāṇi grahāḥ tathā |</em> and a long account follows on this. But 
this has not been amplified or explained in other texts, due to unknown reasons. However, it is not 
part of Valmiki Ramayana.</p>
