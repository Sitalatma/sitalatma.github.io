<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 52<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Seetha is abducted by Ravana. When they are on their way to Lanka the whole nature along with its inhabitants 
laments for the atrocious abduction of Seetha. In here, almost every verse is elaborated, for they contain 
poetic niceties, and hence more stuffing in introduction is unbefitting.</p>

<em>1. tārā adhipa mukhī</em> = stars&#39;, lord, visaged - ṣeetha; <em>sā tu</em> = she, on her part;
<em>rāvaṇena vinihatam</em> = by Ravana, [nearly] killed; <em>tam gṛidhra rājam nirīkṣya</em> = 
at him, eagles, king of, on gazing at; <em>su duḥkhitā</em> = highly anguished; <em>vilalāpa</em> 
= wept away.</p>

<p class="tat">
Seetha whose visage is like a full moon wept on gazing the king of eagles Jatāyu whom Ravana nearly 
killed. [3-52-1]</p>

There occurs another verse before this one in Eastern recension which says that Ravana has firstly seen 
Jatāyu who is spinning on earth to breath his last: <em>
tam alpa 
jīvitam gṛidhram sphurantam rākṣha adipa | dadarsha bhūmau patitam samipe rāghava āshramāt ||</em>thereby 
giving some time to Seetha to recollect what has happened.</p>

<em>2. lakṣaṇam</em> = characteristics - of omens; <em>svapnam</em> = [concomitants of] dreams; <em>
shakuni</em> = presages [shakuna] svara darshanam = [of birds,] callings&#39;, seeing [cognisance]; <em>
narāṇām</em> = of humans; <em>sukha duḥkheṣu</em> = in ecstasy, in agony; <em>avashyam</em> = definitely;

<p class="tat">
&quot;Humans definitely perceive either agony or ecstasy by its concomitant happenings, or by the characteristics 
of uncommon reflexes of their own body parts, or by the presages, or by conjecturable concomitants, 
or by cognising calls of birds. [3-52-2]</p>

<div id="btn1" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Vividly: Seetha&#39;s plaint is like this: &#39;Oh, Rama, we humans do perceive good or bad happenings by the 
presages, like concomitant happenings of some hindrances when a deed is attempted, like unforeseen tidings 
like sneezing, a minor accident or a misfire, or unable to catch a sight of one&#39;s own face in a mirror... 
or by the undue reflexes of bodily parts, like flutter of eyelids or shudder of shoulders or arms... 
or by the callings of birds and movements of animals... so, by now your left shoulder and left eye should 
have shuddered, or some crows might have cawed uglily, or some birds might have gone from your right 
to left, except <em>garuDa, bharadwaja</em> birds, and by these forebodings why do not you cognise that something 
is happening to me and thus why not come to my rescue?&#39;</p>

&quot;Oh, Rama, for sure you are not able to know about big catastrophe called my kidnap is chancing on you,

these animals, presuming that they are pestering you...</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, Rama, this sky flier Jatāyu who mercifully came here to save me is verily mangled on his encountering 
Ravana, and he is sprawling on earth, indeed by my ill luck.&quot; Thus Seetha wailed. [3-52-4]</p>

bhāva/import: &#39;ṃy ill luck is so preponderant, in that it has demolished this Jatāyu, who by himself 
is a pious and merited being who came to help the helpless one like me... but my ill luck pervaded over 
such an impeccable being also... otherwise Jatāyu would have vanquished Ravana... thus, when an immeasurable 
ill luck is holding sway, it is for you, and you alone, oh, Rama, to come for my rescue...&#39;</p>

bhāva/import: A subject&#39;s bawling in the audience of a king is different from that of a cry of a subject 
in a moor. Here Seetha is visualising those two Kakutstha-s, Rama, and Lakshmana, right in her front, 
in a halo, and suppliantly bawling, as though asking them to come out that halo to help her out. Her 
bawling is not in a clamorous tone but it is a<em>roshantīm madhura svarām</em> &#39;crying with mellowly voice...&#39; 
as detailed at verse 42 below, for there should be difference between the braying of an ass and parroting 
of a parrot.</p>

Ravana, the lord of demons, has repeatedly and harshly taunted Seetha saying, &#39;leave it off, leave it 
off...&#39; when Seetha devoid of Rama in that timberland is clinging and muffling a sturdy tree like a 
climber plant, and bawling, &#39;Rama, Rama,&#39; and that demon whose shine is similar to the Death has clutched 
her hair loosened from her bun, as death loomed large on him. [3-52-7, 8]</p>

<div id="btn5" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
bhāva/import: Here the word <em>vane</em> &#39;in timberland...&#39; is actually &#39;loneliness...&#39; plus, &#39;minus Rama...&#39; 
and her crying is <em>araṇya rodana</em> &#39;a cry in wilderness...&#39; And from the viewpoint of Ravana, she is uttering 
a wild cry indicating that &#39;the giant tree called Ravana is going to fall...&#39; as with the woodcutters&#39; 
yelling &#39;timber... timber...&#39; as a warning cry that a tree is about to fall, when the word &#39;timber&#39; 
is used esp. as intransitive. This catching a chaste woman by her hair is the worst possible crime and 
sin as explained at 3-50-13 of this chapter. And now all the gods feel satisfied for the commencement 
of the process for elimination of vice on earth, called Ravana, though pitying Seetha.</p>

<div id="btn6" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Here, the &#39;capturing Seetha by her shadow&#39; as explained by ṃaheshvara Tīrtha, is an untouched subject. 
If she can be captured by shadow while she is in her senses and agitating and clinging a sturdy tree, 
as with Simhika-Hanuma in Sundara Kanda, Ravana should not have given her this much time to bemoan, 
but should have captured by her shadow without leaving her to pay a visit to dying Jatāyu. Hence, this 
capture is viewed on a human plane, rather than a conjuror&#39;s trick.</p>

until the arrival of Rama and would have informed Rama of Seetha&#39;s abduction, though they may not be 
able to combat Ravana or hurl a curse at Ravana. But Ravana is no fool to abduct Seetha while a bystander 
stands over looking on the spectacle. Hence, these sages said here are those that are available in the

Again a poetic &#39;thinking&#39; that even speechless beings can presage and prognosticate. Though they may 
not tell us directly, their body language and odd behaviour will certainly tell. The behaviour of animals

all, a frog crocks before a rain.</p>

dhvani/innuendo: If some parts of a mountain are afire it is no problem since it is usual. But when 
the mountain itself is overly and muchly aflame, it is impracticable for any to prevent it or help it 
out. The upper cloth of Seetha&#39;s sari is goldenly silky and thus it will have a tinge of reddish brown 
hue, like the outer edge of the tongue of fire. That fringe <em>pallu</em> is upheaved, [intr.] rise and fall 
rhythmically or spasmodically, by air and it is flagging off the annihilation of Ravana, by its flag-like 
motions on his face. Thus, Ravana who is standing like a mountain as of now is destined soon to become 
a mountain with a self-ruinous fire, overly and muchly.</p>

dhvani/innuendo: The reddish lotus petals which hitherto are on her body, as garlands and on her braid 
as a chaplet, are crumpled and loosened in the tussle and thus each petal is falling each time. Instead 
of falling onto earth, they are upheaved and sprinkled on Ravana&#39;s body by the fast wind under the feet

bhāva/import: The simile <em>upama</em> of Seetha&#39;s pearly strings of a pendant to River Ganga may 
be observed and the portrayal of <em>ganga avataraṇa</em> &#39;Ganga&#39;s descent to earth...&#39; may be referred

the stings are falling off medially from two mountains, called Seetha&#39;s breasts, as Ganga also rose

&#39;advances towards a woman with a libidinous look, or a voluptuous gesticulation

etc, is as good as fondling her own babies...&#39; Again according to gautama sūtrā-s 
&#39;lustful eying, or teasingly hankering after other&#39;s women is to be avoided...&#39; </p>

Even the
mitrākshara &#39;A treatise of Friendlily Advises&#39; says: &#39;seeing voyeuristically, 
bodily gesticulations, habitual observations, or hankering after lustfully etc., are immoral for a man

previous chapter of this Aranya Kanda: punaḥ ca samgṛihya ruroda &#39;again

parishvajya, āli.ngya the words with clear-cut action, &#39;embraced, hugged

thousands of pieces if he touches other&#39;s woman...&#39; But it is not yet splintered though he handled Seetha 
that roughly. Hence, that curse in its actuality is &#39;raping&#39; but not mere &#39;touching&#39; of body parts. 
Touching the &#39;untouchable&#39; parts of other&#39;s women, that too without proper and full consent of that 
woman. As such, though he touched Seetha, carried on his flanks, took to his Lanka on his own body, 
he gives her time to reconcile herself, but does not make haphazard advances unilaterally. Thus, a difference 
between touching and fondling, grasping and caressing is established and it is no sin or taboo for any 
woman to do so.</p>
