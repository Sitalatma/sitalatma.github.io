<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Rama pacifies Lakshmana, saying that Bharata, due to his affection towards his brothers and due to the distress that troubles his mind
after hearing of the news of their exile, he came to the forest and not with any other motive. Ashamed of himself to hear the opinion of Rama about
Bharata, and descending the tree, Lakshmana hides his abashment by changing the topic. Commanded by Bharata that no disturbance should be caused to
the hermitage occupied by Rama, the army encamps around the edge of the mountain, chitrakuta.</p>
