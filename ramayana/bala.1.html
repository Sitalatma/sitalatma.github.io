<h1><a href="index.html">Valmiki Ramayana</a></h1>
<h2>Bala kanda</h2>








	<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - Book Of Youthful ṃajesties<br>chapter [Sarga] 1<br>
		Introduction</h3>
		
		<p class="tat">
		Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
		of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
		from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
		Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
		this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.</p>
		
		<p class="tat">
		Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
		Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
		classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
		identified with the 24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
		in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
		letter <em>ta</em> an auspicious letter.</p>

Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki&#39;s thinking aloud, 
about the qualities of his prospective hero of this epic, is the very opening questions put 
to an Omniscient Sage Narada. Both the sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki 
asks Narada, &quot;who is that man with godly qualities?&#39; If Narada tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, 
there is nothing left for Valmiki to compose his epic, because there are numerous mythologies, 
purāṇa-s, that have already adored God Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, 
again Valmiki need not attempt to author about some king, however great that king might be.

For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From <em>niya ātma</em> 
to <em>vashī</em> these are the attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. <em>
swarūpa nirupaka lakshṇāḥ</em> . This <em>niyata ātmā</em> is &#39;immutable Absolute, this 
is the postulate of any Upanishad: <em>ya ātmā apahata pāpmā virajo vimṛityur vishoko...</em> 
8-7-1, chāndojña Upanishad. <em>mahā vīryaḥ = acintya vividha vicitra shaktivataḥ</em> 
Absolute is Omnicompetent <em>parā asya shaktiḥ vividhā iva shrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna 
bala kriyā ca</em> 6-8, Shwetāshvatara Upanishad. The word <em>dyutimān</em> is for the 
attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness. <em>tam eva bhāntam 
anubhāti sarvam tasya bhāsā sarvam idam bhāti</em> 2-11, ṃundaka Upanishad. And the
<em>dhṛithimān</em> is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjanti <em>dhṛitiḥ tu tuṣṭiḥ santoṣaḥ</em> 
and as said in <em>ānando brahama - ānandāt eva khalu imāni bhūtāni jāyante</em> 6, 
Taittarīya Upanishad. Next, <em>vashī</em> Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe.
<em>eko vahī sarva bhūta antarātmā</em> 2-5-12, Katha Upanishad and <em>sarvasya vashī 
sarvasya īshānaḥ</em> and the like. The rest of the attributes of Rama as said by Narada 
are identifiable with the causative factors of that Absolute in Creation, and the process 
of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.</p>

				The word रक्षिता is the Nominative Singular of रक्षितृ and means Protector. Please note that prajāpatiḥ can be applied to Vedic Gods as well as to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord ṃaheswara.

Weekly of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading
<font color="#B3003A">Ancient India may have had N-arms</font> , in the Statesman, with dateline 
ṃoscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe 
the disaster caused by such <em>astra-s,</em> now loosely termed as a well crafted bow and 
sky rocketing arrows, as below:</p>

<em>&#39;A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire 
was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be 
perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... 
the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with 
clouds...&#39;</em></p>

Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of <em>Brahma astra,</em> as in ṃaha Bharata, 
the other Epic of India. Thus the Dhanur Veda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, 
which fortunately has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything 
would have been annihilated by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to ṃahabharata, 
there are elaborate accounts of such <em>astra-s</em> in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, 
who is well-versed in warfare, gives many such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow 
references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.</p>

At times Rama is said to be &#39;the son of Kausalya...&#39; than the son Dasharatha, because the 
word Kausalya does not signify his mother alone, the daughter of King of Kosala, but it has 
meanings like <em>kshema, kushala, sāmarthya, puṇya, nipuṇatva</em> &#39;safeness, soundness, 
capability, merit, expertise...&#39; and this also signifies Queen Kausalya&#39;s worshipping of Vishnu. 
When dynasty, valour, braveness etc., are said, Rama&#39;s name will be attached with Dasharatha. 
An ocean is not a bottomless one but an unfathomable one. So also Rama&#39;s heart has a reachable 
bottom, where pearls, gems, and other treasures of virtues are abounding, and it can be reached 
with a heartily approach. For a hard-hearted one Rama&#39;s heart becomes an unfathomable abyss 
and he will get lost in it.&nbsp; <em>girayoḥ varṣha dhārābhir haryamānā 
na vivyadhuḥ | abhibhūya mānā vyasanaiḥ yathā adhokṣhaja cetasā ||</em>&nbsp; &#39;true

in the Supreme. Equally, mountains are unshaken though battered by storms or lightings...&#39; 
So, like a mountain he is unalterable and constant for a true devotee. An icy-mountain is 
meltable by scorching sun, thus Rama also melts down when his adherents are scorched with 
their problems.</p>

Readers may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are &#39;a 
must.&#39; Pt. Satya Vrat, the author of <font color="#B3003A">Ramayana - A Linguistic Study</font> 
says: &quot;Ellipsis is the peculiarity of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their 
writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense which has to be supplemented by <em>adhyādhāra</em>, 
viz., supply of words, that would fit in the context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis 
could be readily understood and would suggest the word or words that would make it up...&#39; 
We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, than by the order of 
words, for there is a saying... <em>pāṭha krame artha kramo balīyaḥ...</em> So, this <em>
adhyādhāra</em>, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit
