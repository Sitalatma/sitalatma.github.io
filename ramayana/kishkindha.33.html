<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy Monkeys</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 33<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
The magnificence and luxury of Kishkindha and its inmates is depicted here. Lakshmana on the invitation 
of Angada proceeds through the streets of the city examining its glory. On reaching palace-chambers, 
feeling shy to enter inside where the women are moving about and also infuriated at Sugreeva&#39;s callousness, 
Lakshmana makes a thunderous noise with his bowstring. Listening that sound Sugreeva is terrorised and 
bids Tara to approach Lakshmana to pacify him. Accordingly, Tara approaches Lakshmana and pacifies his 
anger and invites him to their palace.</p>

<p>
This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Aranya Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. 
Here Sugreeva is indulged in bodily pleasures with his own females and in Aranya Kanda, as accused by 
Shurpanakha, Ravana is hankering after other&#39;s women. Here Sugreeva dizzy with drinks and in Aranya 
Ravana is dizzy with his supremacy. These two chapters, as detailed by ancient commentators, equally 
deal with <font color="#B3003A">raaja niiti shastra</font> &#39;political science.&#39; Here the only rescue 
to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas Ravana has none to come 
to his aid when chided by Shurpanakha. Out of total 66 verses that are here in this traditional edition, 
verses from 25 to 62 are unavailable in critical edition, perhaps estimating them to be lateral interpolations, 
and there this chapter is quickly concluded. These verses belong to the exposition of &#39;kingly vices...&#39; 
on which Tara rationally defends.</p>
