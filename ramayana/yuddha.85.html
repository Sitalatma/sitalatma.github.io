Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Vibhishana suggests Rama to send Lakshmana to kill Indrajit, even before Indrajit completes the sacrificial fire in the sanctuary of
Nikumbhila. Rama then asks Lakshmana to proceed with the battle along with armies of Sugreeva, Hanuma, Jambavan and Vibhishana. Lakshmana proceeds to
Nikumbhila along with Hanuma, Vibhishana and Jambavan to kill Indrajit. Lakshmana accompanied by Vibhishana, Angada and Hanuma penetrates that
heterogeneous army of the enemies at the sanctuary of Nikumbhila.</p>
