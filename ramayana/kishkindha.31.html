<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 31<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Enraged Lakshmana goes to the extent of saying that Sugreeva is to be eliminated and then Angada and others will search for Seetha.
Perturbed by his brother's vehemence Rama pacifies him and sends to Kishkindha where on seeing the infuriated, hissing, snakelike Lakshmana monkeys
are upset. Lakshmana sends Angada to Sugreeva to inform about his arrival. Sugreeva could not comprehend firstly because he is in an inebriated
condition, but later comes to senses on the advise of his ministers.</p>

born one - younger one - Lakshmana; <em>kāminam dīnam</em> = one who is yearning, thereby pitiable - Rama; but; <em>a dīna sattvaḥ</em> = not,

<em>iti uvāca</em> = this way, spoke.</p>
<p class="tat">
When Rama of undeterred stamina has become pitiable while yearning for Seetha, overcome with grief while the search for Seetha is
becoming futile, overwrought with anger while Sugreeva is reneging on his promise, to such an elder prince-brother from a godlike king, his younger
prince-brother Lakshmana spoke in this way. [4-31-1]</p>

<p class="tat">
"As a forester Sugreeva will not abide by the conduct of gentlefolk, he is not appreciative of the fruits of incidental events like
gaining kingdom and regaining wife occurring out of your deed of eliminating Vali, thus he will not enjoy the prosperity of the kingdom anymore.
Obviously his prudence is behindhand, isn't it! [4-31-2]</p>

not keep that pact or its fruits holy, as nothing is evincible of his help...</p>

"Without any notion of requiting the beneficence you have accorded he is insanely involved in primitive pleasures, such as he is, let

<div id="btn1" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">In the last chapter Rama says that he wants to kill Sugreeva for his faithlessness. Now Lakshmana is parroting out those very
words. But Rama is now telling that 'killing a friend is a sin, so you do not commit it...' Is Rama contradicting his own statements in last chapter?
In reply it is said, not so. Last time Rama gave a picture of his ire about Sugreeva, to the extent of eliminating him, if Sugreeva still avoids any
arrangement. But Lakshmana, being straight-to-nose person and a textualist, has started to Kishkindha to eliminate Sugreeva and to enthrone Angada,
under whose leadership the other monkeys can search Seetha. It is same situation with Hanuma in Sundara, where Hanuma is asked just to elicit the
whereabouts of Seetha, but he burns down Lanka, and if anybody questions, Hanuma is apt to say that he is monkeyish with Lanka. Such an occasion
shall not happen in Kishkindha, that too through Lakshmana. Thus, Rama is pacifying Lakshmana in saying that 'my words shall not be understood that
way, and killing of Sugreeva is not to be undertaken forthwith.'</p>

<p class="tat">
"It will be apt of you to speak to that reneger Sugreeva with placating words rather than with caustic remarks, as his sin is no more

one-foot-pathway Lakshmana strode in a shortcut way through the thick of trees...' or <em>dūram
eka padīm tyaktvā</em> in another way 'releasing the first foot in a longer stride he made
haste.' This is to show Lakshmana's vehemence and valour are better than that of Vanara-s, which
was explained by the sage-poet at the time of creation of Vanara-s by celestials at 1-17-25
onwards. When Vanara-s can fell trees or volley the peaks of mountains with some effort, Lakshmana
can do the same effortlessly.</p>
