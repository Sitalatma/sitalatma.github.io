Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Kabandha requests Rama to incinerate him, so that he would get his divine form and then would be able to give some clues in regaining
Seetha. He admits that the present hideous state has chanced only because of his arrogant behaviour, thereby a sort of repentance has occurred in
him. A course of conversations occurs among these two, as each is distrustful of the other.</p>

being the riddle of grammarians, we are supposed to know that he is a demon blessed for gandharva-hood, and then accursed to demon-hood, and then
becomes a gandharva again and goes to heaven, at the blessing of Rama. The last compound in second stanza differs with that of other mms, in wording,
but not in its meaning.</p>

there is a mutual distrust. 'What if this demon when reduced to ashes cannot say anything... like Virādha...' is the distrust in Rama, and 'what if
I am going to say the name of Sugreeva now itself, before they incinerate me, and on knowing the name of Sugreeva, what if this Rama departs quickly
to Sugreeva, without burning me...' is the mistrust of Kabandha. The averral of Rama to Kabandha is unclear so far, and in order to put his case
straight Rama has to rehash, so he is going over again. The same is the case with Sugreeva. He blatantly lies to Rama that he does not know Ravana,
in Kishkindha Kanda. And if insisted Sugreeva, or to that matter of fact Seetha, both are ready with their self-assertive dialogue:&nbsp; <em>kaḥ na aparādhyati</em> 'who errs not...'</p>

Kabandha is always telling that 'I have no knowledge... I lost my discernment...' etc., half told is the fact that there is someone out there to help
Rama. Hence, the believability is bechanced. Sun's horses will never be fatigued, but fatigued is this Kabandha in this grotesque physique, as a
vehicle predestined to communicate some information to Rama. And when a dusking Sun is indicated, another dawning Sun is also indicated, in his
freshness. So also, Kabandha is about to resurrect after this incineration, as a vehicular messenger for Rama.</p>

that humans do not burn or bury the undead, and Rama may now leave this dying Kabandha to his natural death, and go away. But Rama is already
acquainted with the dying ceremonies of demons, where they die only after a physically dead, perforce, by consigning them to fire or burying them
alive, as in the case of Virādha. Hence this stingy maiming and baiting of Kabandha is continued, to burn him down, perforce.</p>
