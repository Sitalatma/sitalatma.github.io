This is another celebrated verse chanted even today. So far Rama is a dear prince to his parents. 
But here, no less than Sage Vishvamitra said to have deified Rama in asking him to &#39;get up&#39; 
from divine trance to undertake the human duties to eliminate evil, like the dawn of the sun 
eliminating the evil darkness. In other ancient manuscripts the same verse obtains as:</p>

At the rising of the sun as well as at noon certain observances, invocations, and prayers 
were prescribed which might under no circumstances be omitted. One of these observances was 
the recitation of the sAvitri, [Gayatri, so to say,] a Vedic hymn to the Sun of wonderful 
beauty - Gorresio.</p>

The meaning of <em>kan darpa</em> is one who is carnally, prideful, i.e., he who takes pride 
in arousing lecherousness. And <em>kāma</em> is &#39;desire&#39; the natural basic instinct of any 
animal, and the one which the sages and saints want to overcome, so they named Love-god from 
their point of view. In these verses the two words <em>kṛita udvāham</em> , and their meaning 
as on marrying Parvati and going this way with his coterie etc., is held incongruous to other 
mythological episodes of Shiva&#39;s marriage with Parvati, and ṃanmatha&#39;s effort to enkindle 
love in Shiva. After marriage with Parvati, some argue, where is the question of Love-god&#39;s 
interference to inculcate love in Shiva. It is clear in Rama charita ṃānas how this Shiva-Parvati 
marriage occurs. And some give the meaning like this: <em>kṛita</em> where <em>kṛi= karaṇe 
udvāham tu devesham</em> = to actualise, marriage, only, of Shiva; <em>gacchantam</em> on 
going there, Love-god, <em>sa marudgaṇam</em> with Wind-gods and other deities; <em>dharṣayāmāsa</em> 
started to attack Shiva. The Love-god on going there to that hermitage that is being described 
by Vishvamitra along with Wind-gods et al, with an intention to get the marriage of Shiva 
performed, assailed Shiva.</p>

The word <em>avadhyat</em> is otherwise said in other texts as <em>ava dagdhasya rudreṇa cakshusā</em>, 
to derive a clear meaning of &#39;burnt down,&#39; because <em>avadhyat</em> is just killing, slaying,
