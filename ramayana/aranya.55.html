<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The forest

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 55<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana entices Seetha to marry him by demonstrating various luxuries and comforts, and even baiting her to become his empress. The
words of Ravana have some latent meanings as derived by ancient commentators and they are included here, as far as possible.</p>

is about to capsize in an ocean spreadeagled with whirlwinds, and one alike an impala altogether swerved from its herd of impala yet hemmed in with
dog-wolves, that nightwalker came nigh of such a Seetha whose face is downcast unwilling to see any, and to such a pitiable Seetha who is in the
shackles of her sorrow, that supremo of demons compellingly started to show his palace which is similar to any paradisiacal palace. [3-55-4, 5,
6]</p>
<div id="btn0" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">Then he must have hauled her by her hand or demonesses must have dragged all along the corridors, chambers and all over, or as
usual, he must have carried her on his flank to show his palace. Taking this situation and the statement at verse 1,<em>ātmānam buddhi
vaiklavyāt</em> Rama Tilaka negates the idea that Seetha is brought to Lanka as a much cherished Goddess Lakshmi, but her bringing is only with a villainous intent.
Even then, the supporters of Ravana - the devotee - disagree. There are many such slants given to Ravana's dialogs, to portray him as a devotee, in
this chapter itself.</p>

possible only on seeing the objects of lure. And yielding to such an opulent demon or his opulence, just for the sake of carnality, is beyond the
scope of Seetha's thinking according to her reply to Ravana, in next chapter 'all this affluence is going to be reduced to ashes...' keeping Rama in
view as the reducing agent, for Hanuma, the actual reducer of this affluence, is yet an unknown entity.</p>
