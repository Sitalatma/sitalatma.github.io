<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 62<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama bewails for Seetha as an ambivert, ambivalent romantic epical hero and asks Lakshmana to return to Ayodhya, as Rama is certain to
perish without Seetha. He thinks his agony aloud, weighing pros and cons of his situation.</p>
<br><p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 1</strong></p>
<p class="RomSloka">
sītām apaśyan dharmātmā śoka upahata cetanaḥ |<br>
vilalāpa mahābāhū rāmaḥ kamala locanaḥ || 3-62-1</p>
<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. dharmaatmaa</em> = virtue-souled one; <em>mahaabaahuu</em> = long armed one; <em>kamala locanaH</em> = lotus, eyed one;
<em>raamaH</em> = Rama; <em>siitaam a pashyan</em> = Seetha, not, being able to see; <em>shoka upahata cetanaH</em> = anguish, marred, sagacity;
<em>vilalaapa</em> = bewailed.</p>
<p class="tat">
In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish and he bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are
reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is long arms. [3-62-1]</p>
<p class="comment">Some mms use the word <em>kaama</em> in the compound <em>shoka upahata
cetanaH</em> thus it becomes <em>kaama upahata cetana</em> and then it means 'his sagacity is
marred by desire for Seetha...' and because of the adjacency of word <em>dharmaatmaa</em>
'righteous one...' 'a righteous desire is no sin to desire for... hence his desire for Seetha is
righteous...' Then <em>mahaabaahuu</em> denotes that he is wailing raising his long arms, and
<em>kamala locana</em> is indicative of redness of lotuses, thus his eyes are reddening by his
wailing.</p>
<p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 2</strong></p>
<p class="RomSloka">
paśyan iva ca tām sītām apaśyan madana arditaḥ |<br>
uvāca rāghavo vākyam vilāpa āśraya durvacam || 3-62-2</p>
<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. madana arditaH raaghavaH</em> = by Love-god, cowed down, Raghava; <em>taam siitaam</em> = at her, at Seetha; <em>a
pashyan</em> = [even if] not, seeing; <em>pashyan iva</em> = seeing, as though; <em>vilaapa aashraya dur vacam</em> = wail, sheltered [pampered,]
badly [inarticulately,] speech [articulacy - because his speech took shelter of waling he is articulating inarticulately with a speech that is
pampered by that wailing instinct; <em>[ittham</em> = this way]; <em>uvaaca vaakyam</em> = said, words [vented his heart.]</p>
<p class="tat">
Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to her in a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing
pampered his articulacy because his speech took shelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent out his
heart in this way. [3-62-2]</p>
<p class="comment">Here the poet is starting the sixth phase among the ten phases called
<em>manmadha avasthaaH</em> 'phases of pangs of love,' and this one is called <em>a + rati</em>
'non-indulgence, the ambivalence, the ambiversion...' of the romantic hero, in romantic epical
poetry.</p>

<p class="tat">
"Flowers fascinate you very much, my dear, hence you veil yourself with the full bloomed branches of Ashoka tree, but that alone is
amplifying my anguish because you both have presently became tormentors. [3-62-3]</p>

"Oh, lady, you are facetiously glorying in the boscage of fully bloomed Karnikaara trees which is really wafting worry to me, rather

Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, and bewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha,

them. [3-62-20]</p>
