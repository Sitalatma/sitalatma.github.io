<h3><em>Worshiping <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> Devotees Is a Tradition</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp42" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
All service is based on the same point: In the heart you have to be attached to <em>Kṛṣṇa</em>. With some service you can fake it to a certain degree. You can go on for some time gardening, sweeping the floor, or typing correspondence without love of Godhead, but you cannot fake it when you are preaching. You must have some genuine attachment to <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> within your heart, because every day you are exposed to <em>māyā</em>. You may consider yourself glorious at doing a particular preaching service, but as soon as somebody criticizes you or a demon gives you trouble on the street, the glorious illusion is shattered and you reconsider, thinking, “Maybe I should become a cook.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp43" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The fact that one continues <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> proves that one has attained love of Godhead. Therefore we worship the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees. Sometimes a foolish polemic arises if someone dares to say that the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees are the greatest, because others think, “What's the matter with you? Don't you understand that everything else is just as important?" Yes, it is true—the point is love of God—but a preacher must have love of God; otherwise, he sinks back into just taking care of himself. Therefore we worship the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp44" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In Bengal, if you do a <em>ha&shy;ri&shy;nā&shy;ma</em> on the street, all the people come out with <em>lot&shy;ās</em> of water and try to throw it at your feet. They know you will probably jump away, so they are satisfied if it just lands on the ground in front of you. Then they bring out a plate of colored rice and cracked coconut, and they start offering you <em>āra&shy;ti</em>. Everybody—every householder, every villager—comes out to worship the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees. This is tradition.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp45" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It is a tradition in Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's movement to worship saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na devotees. It is not a concoction of fanatics. It is a <em>sam&shy;pra&shy;dā&shy;ya</em> tradition coming to us through the <em>pa&shy;ram&shy;pa&shy;rā</em>, and it cannot be whimsically given up. It must be continued, because love of God comes in this age through <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>—glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp46" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> we do nowadays is absolutely <em>pa&shy;ram&shy;pa&shy;rā</em>. Although book distribution is criticized by some persons of little knowledge, it is Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's mission without even the slightest deviation. It is the authorized means of attaining love of God. <em>Ya&shy;jñaiḥ saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na-prā&shy;yair/ya&shy;jan&shy;ti hi su-me&shy;dha&shy;saḥ</em>—if you have brains, you will join in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em> and become a lover of God. You will understand and appreciate the association of anyone fully absorbed in this <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement.

<h3><em>The Birth of the <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> Movement</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp48" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement appeared when Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya began to preach in Na&shy;va&shy;dvī&shy;pa. At that time, there was only the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Book distribution developed later on, when Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya encouraged the six Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs of Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na to write books. Some people ask, "Why didn't Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Himself start the book distribution?” The answer is simple: There were no books. First He had to make the devotees who would write the books. Then He could inspire others to produce and distribute them.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp49" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu's foremost representatives, Śrī&shy;la Sa&shy;nā&shy;ta&shy;na Go&shy;svā&shy;mī and Śrī&shy;la Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mī, received direct instruction from Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya to reveal the principles of devotional service in written form for the benefit of all Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas. When the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs first went to Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na, it was a jungle. The many places of pilgrimage we can visit nowadays had not yet been excavated and restored. Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya instructed Rūpa and Sa&shy;nā&shy;ta&shy;na Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs to rediscover these places, but their main business was to write books. Sitting under the trees, they would dip a quill pen into some ink made from pressed flowers and write on special leaves (there was no paper at that time). On one leaf after another they wrote the wonderful books that form the foundation of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement-books such as the <em>Hari-bhak&shy;ti-vi&shy;lā&shy;sa</em> and <em>Bhak&shy;ti-ra&shy;sā&shy;mṛ&shy;ta-sin&shy;dhu</em>, which give all the necessary instructions for devotional service.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp50" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The intention of the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs was never sectarian. They wanted all the people of the world, regardless of their languages, to get the essence of Ve&shy;dic knowledge. Prior to this, Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;va philosophy—so perfectly extracted from the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Pu&shy;rā&shy;ņas</em>—had not been systematically written down. But for the benefit of the followers of Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu, book production was begun by Śrī&shy;la Sa&shy;nā&shy;ta&shy;na and Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs and later continued by Śrī&shy;la Jīva Go&shy;svā&shy;mī, who was the most prolific author among the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs. The writings of the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs turned out to be the most important form of saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na, because they were writing books that were soon to be distributed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp51" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
After the disappearance of Śrī&shy;la Sa&shy;nā&shy;ta&shy;na Go&shy;svā&shy;mī and Śrī&shy;la Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mī, Śrī&shy;la Jīva Go&shy;svā&shy;mī became the Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;va <em>ācā&shy;rya</em> in Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na. Śrī&shy;la Jīva Go&shy;svā&shy;mī was convinced by Śrī&shy;ma&shy;ti Jāh&shy;navā-devī, the wife of Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and head of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement, of the need to send bhak&shy;ti literature from Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na to Bengal. Some years earlier, she had visited Rūpa and Sa&shy;nā&shy;ta&shy;na in Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na and was well aware of the abundant spiritual literature the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs were producing. To comply with her wishes, Śrī&shy;la Jīva Go&shy;svā&shy;mī sent Śrī&shy;ni&shy;vās&shy;a Ācā&shy;rya and Na&shy;rot&shy;tama dāsa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra to distribute the books that had been written to the intellectuals of Bengal. From the precedent set by the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs, book production has been the basis of spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement right up to the present time.

<h3><em><em>Bolo Kṛṣṇa Bha&shy;ja Kṛṣṇa<br />Koro Kṛṣṇa-śi&shy;kṣā</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp53" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda began preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West, he used the example of Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi to demonstrate the incredible mercy of Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu, because wherever he looked he saw Ja&shy;gāis and Mā&shy;dhāis. By using this example, he clearly implied, “Don't worry, by Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's mercy even you can be saved.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp54" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi were members of a wealthy and learned aristocratic family that had been respected in Na&shy;va&shy;dvī&shy;pa for many generations, but these two men were extraordinary, for they were the greatest debauchees, murderers, drunkards, and thieves. After stealing someone's belongings, they would burn down his house. They would rape women and even kill people. They were very big, very crazy, and could not be stopped. Even the law was afraid of them. They were total outcasts—black sheep in society—and their family had rejected them long ago. They constantly wandered the streets of Na&shy;va&shy;dvī&shy;pa in a drunken state, making big scenes. Whenever one of them was not paying attention, the other one would beat him with his fists. One moment they would embrace each other in brotherly love, and the next moment they would pull each other by the hair and fall to the ground, fighting. They were completely mad—more or less the way we were before joining Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's movement.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp55" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
One day Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya told Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra, “I have a new program for you. I want you to go out and preach. Just tell everybody, '<em>Bolo kṛṣṇa, bha&shy;ja kṛṣṇa, koro kṛṣṇa-śi&shy;kṣā</em>—chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, worship Lord Kṛṣṇa, and live according to His transcendental instructions.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp56" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra would go out every day, knock on every door, and say, “Chant Kṛṣṇa's name, worship Him, and accept His instructions into your life.” Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda often cited Lo&shy;ca&shy;na dāsa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra, who described how Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da cut a canal from the ocean of mercy, which was blocked on all four sides. Taking that canal to the door of every house, He would flood everybody in the house with love of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp57" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Seeing the effulgence coming from the bodies of these two wonderful personalities, the pious people would say, "Yes, I will do it from today on. Welcome, please come in and take something to eat.” But Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa would reply, "No, we have no time. We are busy preaching, and we have to go to the next door.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp58" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
At some houses, however, the impious people would shout at them, saying, "What are you doing here? You are simply frauds and im&shy;pos&shy;ters. If you come back again, I'm going to call the law!" Other rascals would say, “You only come here to get something to fill your bellies.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp59" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"This Nimāi Paṇ&shy;ḍi&shy;ta has ruined many good persons, and now He is ruining you as well.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp60" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"Can't you understand that you should only chant 'Kṛṣṇa' softly? Don't you think your God is going to be disturbed by all your screaming and howling?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp61" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra came back every night and told Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya about the rascals they had met, Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya would say, “Do not fear, I will cut off their heads with My <em>cak&shy;ra</em>. Anybody who does not accept what you say, I will cut to pieces."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp62" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu would pacify Him, saying, “Please wait. We want to continue, and we haven't met everybody yet.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp63" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Once Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra were out preaching, and they saw a big crowd of people. Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da asked what was going on, and some of the bystanders replied, “Oh, it is those hooligans Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp64" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
“Who are they?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp65" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"They are terrible persons, Go&shy;sāin. This is no place for You. For Your own safety, You should leave this place immediately.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp66" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da's interest was aroused. “Tell Me more,” He said. "Who are these two, Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi?” After the people explained the whole story, Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da continued, “Oh, I want to go and save them. If these persons are saved, then everybody will worship My Lord, Gaur&shy;āṅga. Everybody will understand that His mercy is supreme in this world, and they will all sing His praises. What a wonderful opportunity!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp67" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In response, the well-meaning people cried out a warning: "Don't go near these fellows! They will harm You or even kill You! They are crazy, don't You understand? Take our words seriously!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp68" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra ignored them and went near the two brothers. Approaching from the side, out of the brothers' vision, Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da called out, “Listen, dear brothers! Chant Kṛṣṇa's name, worship Him, and take His instructions into your life. If you just chant His holy name, you will be happy.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp69" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In one respect the sinful brothers were all right. They were not <em>apa&shy;rādh&shy;īs</em>. They didn't understand how to offend Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas, because they were always too drunk. But now two Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas were standing in front of them. When the brothers heard the request that they surrender to Kṛṣṇa and chant His name, their eyes turned blood-red with rage, and they started chasing Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra, who went racing off in full flight. The two monstrous brothers drunkenly stumbled along after them, screaming, “Wait! We'll show you what we think of your chanting! Why don't you stay here and get to know us better?”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp70" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Then Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra said to Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da, “Another fine mess You've gotten us into. We came here to preach, and look what's happened now! It's all because of Your magnanimous nature.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp71" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da replied, “It's not My fault! It's your Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's fault. He's the one who sent us here."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp72" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Arguing as they were running, Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra complained, “I don't know why I keep coming out with You! You're always getting us into trouble. You jump into the Ganges and start wrestling with the crocodiles. You chase after children playing on the riverbank, screaming frighteningly, and I have to console the angry parents who want to beat You, trying to explain to them that You're an <em>ava&shy;dhū&shy;ta</em> and You think You're a cowherd boy. You ask girls to marry You. You milk cows and drink all the milk. You steal buckets of butter and cream, and when the bewildered cowherd men come to beat You, You run away, leaving me alone to ward them off. I don't know why I come with You all the time. This preaching gets us into so much difficulty!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp73" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In this way they ran down the road toward Śrī&shy;vā&shy;sa Paṇ&shy;ḍi&shy;ta's house enjoying a mock argument. Finally, Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi became so confused that they just fell down on the street, and Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra slipped out of sight to recover. Breathing heavily and looking back in the direction of their fallen pursuers, Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da and Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa began to laugh, joking about the two drunkards and embracing each other in ecstasy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp74" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Upon hearing about everything that had happened, Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya angrily exclaimed, “I will chop them to pieces immediately!”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp75" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu implored, “No, give us a chance to save them. If You will kindly offer Your mercy to them, they will surely be saved.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp76" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
At this Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya said, “If You want them to be saved, then they are immediately saved. It has already happened by Your desire. Soon we shall see them in our company as Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas.” When the associates of the Lord heard this decree, they all started to jubilantly chant “Hari bol!"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp77" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Soon, by divine arrangement (Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's desire), Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi set up their den on the Ganges where Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya took His bath. The rogues were so nasty—rolling around drunkenly and doing all kinds of horrible things—that nobody wanted to bathe in the Ganges anymore. Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya would keep His distance, but when Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi saw Him, they would mockingly request Him to conduct a Dur&shy;gā-āra&shy;ti, because they liked to dance drunkenly to the sound of the sweet <em>kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> coming every night from the Lord's house.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp78" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Shortly thereafter, Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da thought, "Now is My chance.” He stood before Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi peacefully and said, “My Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya wishes that you be blessed with love of Godhead. Please kindly accept the lotus feet of the Lord and render devotional service unto Him.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp79" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
"Who is this?” Mā&shy;dhāi asked, “What does this guy want?” In reply Ja&shy;gāi sneeringly drawled, “He's an <em>ava&shy;dhū&shy;ta</em>.” When Mā&shy;dhāi heard this, he picked up a piece of a broken earthen wine pot and threw it at Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu. It hit Him in the forehead and blood came pouring down all over His body. Mā&shy;dhāi raised his arms and moved forward, wanting to attack again, but Ja&shy;gāi grabbed him and protested, “What are you doing? Are you mad? He's innocent! He didn't do anything wrong. Why are you threatening Him like this? You should protect Him.” The townspeople witnessing the incident quickly ran to Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya and told Him what had happened. When Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya came and saw blood all over Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu, He raised His index finger in the air and cried out threateningly, “<em>Cak&shy;ra!</em>" Summoned thus, the Su&shy;dar&shy;śa&shy;na <em>cak&shy;ra</em> immediately appeared, spinning on His finger. The brothers were struck with amazement and fear, for they knew that this <em>cak&shy;ra</em> was ready to chop them in half.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp80" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu appealed to the Lord. “Stop!” He cried, “You have appeared in this incarnation to save them, not to kill them! Your mission is not to kill the demons but to flood them with love of Godhead. Ja&shy;gāi was trying to protect Me. It's all over now; it was just an accident, and I don't feel any pain. There is nothing to worry about and I am not disturbed."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp81" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya heard this He immediately embraced Ja&shy;gāi, saying, "Oh, My dear Ja&shy;gāi, you are so wonderful for protecting My Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da.” Ja&shy;gāi immediately fell over unconscious in love of Godhead, shaking and rolling on the ground. Since Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi were practically like one soul, Mā&shy;dhāi also became purified. Realizing what a fool he was, he threw himself at the feet of Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya, saying, “Please purify me too! Why only him?”.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp82" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya replied, “I cannot deliver you. You were responsible for shedding Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da's blood.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp83" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But Mā&shy;dhāi begged, “You cannot say this, my Lord. How can You act against Your own religion? In Your previous incarnation You even gave liberation to demons who pierced Your body with arrows. And they were big demons, whereas I'm only a little demon! Why shouldn't You accept me?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp84" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya was firm. “That may be good logic,” He said, "but you have offended Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da Pra&shy;bhu. Go and surrender to Him!” Mā&shy;dhāi immediately clasped the lotus feet of Lord Nityā&shy;nan&shy;da, and then he too became mad in love of Godhead.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp85" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Afterward they all went back to Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's house. When the other devotees saw how Ja&shy;gāi and Mā&shy;dhāi had become the personal associates of the Lord and were rolling on the ground in love of Godhead, they could not believe it. They asked, “How did these drunks become devotees?"
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp86" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya answered, “Don't call them drunks! They are Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas! Accept them as your brothers.” Everybody was amazed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp87" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
In an equally amazing way, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda transformed sinful wretches like us into blissful devotees of Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya and engaged us in the Lord's eternal <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na-lilā</em>.

<div id="pp89" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement took birth with Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu, but its rebirth took place when books became an important and powerful means to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness to everyone. After Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu left this world, Gau&shy;ḍī&shy;ya Vaiṣ&shy;ṇ&shy;avism diminished. The Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas either went back to Godhead or went on different preaching engagements throughout the universe. Only a few were left. The world filled up with dull souls engaging in frui&shy;tive activities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp90" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Over a century ago, Ja&shy;gan&shy;nā&shy;tha dāsa Bā&shy;bā&shy;jī M&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja, the leader of the Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas in Maya&shy;pur, declared to Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;ti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra that he should spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in an organized fashion. On that order, Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;ti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra personally reconstructed the basis of Gau&shy;ḍī&shy;ya Vaiṣ&shy;ṇ&shy;avism. He reestablished the places of Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu's appearance and pastimes in Maya&shy;pur and wrote hundreds of books and articles. But this reconstruction was a hard task, so he begged the Lord to send “a ray of Viṣ&shy;ṇu” to help him. Kṛṣṇa was merciful and sent an assistant, Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī Pra&shy;bhupāda, whose preaching was so powerful that all over India, Mā&shy;yā&shy;vā&shy;di philosophy and caste go&shy;svā&shy;mism were smashed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp91" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī started a society of Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;vas known as the Gau&shy;ḍī&shy;ya Maṭha. He had thousands of disciples, and some of his representatives went as far as England and Germany. His mission was a great one. Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta established the method needed to cut the hard knot of material attachment in the heart, <em>hṛ&shy;da&shy;ya-gran&shy;thi</em>. The way to cut this <em>hṛ&shy;da&shy;ya-gran&shy;thi</em> is with <em>gran&shy;tha</em>—the books of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or <em>śā&shy;stra</em>. <em>Sā&shy;stra</em> means not only "book” but also "weapon.” This relationship is significant, because the books are our weapons.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp92" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Prior to Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;ti&shy;sid&shy;dhān&shy;ta's time, books were distributed to scholars, but not in a systematic way to people in general. Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya recommended chanting and <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em> for the masses and philosophy for the scholars. But as Kali-yuga progressed, people became so fallen that they were unable to accept the chanting and <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, and they required understanding to go forward.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp93" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Therefore Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta put so much emphasis on publishing books. He called book publication the <em>bṛ&shy;had</em>, or big, <em>mṛ&shy;dan&shy;ga</em>. The little <em>mṛ&shy;dan&shy;ga</em> may be heard for one block, but the big <em>mṛ&shy;dan&shy;ga</em> can be heard around the world. In the marble temple Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta had built in Bagh Bazaar, Calcutta, he installed the Deity on one side and the printing press directly opposite, across the courtyard. To him the printing of books was so important that he considered the beat of the press to be <em>kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and wanted it to sound in the temple all day. Listening to that <em>kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and having <em>dar&shy;śa&shy;na</em> of the printing press, the Deities were very happy.

<h3><em><em>Lava-māt&shy;ra</em></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp95" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The <em>śā&shy;stra</em> declares that one should associate with a saintly personality, even if just for a moment, a <em>lava-māt&shy;ra</em>. (A <em>lava</em> is one eleventh of a second.) This association can change one's entire life. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda used his own life as evidence of this statement. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was not interested in hearing from some ordinary <em>sādhu</em> when he first went to see Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī, because Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda had experienced the different <em>sādhus</em> who came to his father's house. They were engaged in illicit activities like smoking <em>gañ&shy;jā</em> or eating meat, and he was not enthusiastic to meet another one. But his friend practically brought him by force.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp96" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
At first Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda started to argue with Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta a little, saying, “How can India take interest in spiritual practices if it is a nation subordinate to the British? First we must gain our freedom, and then we can have Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” But Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta did not accept this argument. He said that winning independence from the British was a material affair; it had nothing to do with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Rather, one should depend on Kṛṣṇa and serve Kṛṣṇa, and then all material problems of life will cease, including the problem of dependency on a foreign power.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp97" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda realized that this <em>sādhu</em> was right and that Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu's mission was safely in the hands of an expert. Although it was not a long meeting, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was completely convinced and took the mission to heart.

<h3><em>If You Ever Get Money</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp99" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra organized a large <em>pa&shy;ri&shy;kra&shy;ma</em> of the Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na area, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda met him at Rā&shy;dhā-kund&shy;a. While they were walking and talking together, Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta stated to Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda confidentially, “I regret that I have built this temple in Bagh Bazaar, because there will be fire within these walls. Already in my presence they are fighting over who will get which room in the temple, and after my departure everything will be ruined. I would rather take down the marble from the walls and floors, sell it, and print books. If you ever get any money, print books."
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp100" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Distributing books in India at that time was difficult. If a disciple went over to Na&shy;va&shy;dvī&shy;pa and distributed even one magazine, Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta would heap praise upon him. It became obvious to Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda that books were more important to his spiritual master than temples, and he became fixed on what was important, although he was living outside the Gau&shy;ḍī&shy;ya Maṭha. From the outside he could observe what his spiritual master was constantly stressing. The others living inside were thinking about the politics and sense gratification concerning their residence and surroundings. There were many problems. That is why Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta called it “fire within the walls.” But Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda, watching his spiritual master act, could see that printing books was the real point. Later, when Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was expanding his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, again and again he always repeated, “Print books! Print books! Print books!” because that is what he had learned from his spiritual master. That is called <em>pa&shy;ram&shy;pa&shy;rā</em>—learn the most important activity from your spiritual master and make it your life's mission.

<h3><em>Taking Up the Mission</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp102" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī made the mission of his father, Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;ti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra, his mission and spread that mission throughout India. Then Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda took up that mission and spread it all over the world. The mission was tenderly passed down from one <em>ācā&shy;rya</em> to the next. Others may claim that they too were responsible for wonderful things in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but we don't see it. We see how one pure devotee can create another, how one <em>ni&shy;tya-sid&shy;dha</em> awakens another, and how the mission is given from guru to disciple.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp103" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta told Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda on their first meeting, “You are intelligent. Preach this mission in the English language for the benefit of the world.” Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda had not even been to the temple yet, but the instruction that eventually led to Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's coming to the Western world was already given. He just walked in, bowed down, listened a little while, made some argument, and got the mission of his life. Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta cut out the formalities and got to the point, because he knew he was talking to a <em>ni&shy;tya-sid&shy;dha</em>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp104" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta was pleased with Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda. When Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda did the preaching that established the Bombay temple in 1935, the devotees said, “He is expert. He should be the temple president.” But Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta replied, “Do not push him for this now. In the future he will do everything." Nobody understood the meaning of this statement. Some thought Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was too attached and could not do it, but they did not know that Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta knew Kṛṣṇa's plan. He used the word "everything." What did that mean? It meant exactly that Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda would do everything needed to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls all over the world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp105" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī was so powerful that after his disappearance, nobody was there to replace him. So many problems arose, because his disciples were not working together for the preaching mission. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda once wrote in one of his Vyāsa-pūjā offerings, “The world looks empty in the absence of you.” The world looked vacant, for his spiritual master was the only one who could tie together the disjointed forces.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp106" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda tried to bring these forces together, but he could not, so in due course of time he took up that mission by writing and publishing books. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was producing books twenty years before he came to America. In the 1940's he started “Back to Godhead," an English magazine that presented the philosophy in an understandable way. He started to translate the Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya-ca&shy;ri&shy;tā&shy;mṛ&shy;ta</em>, which he printed serially in his magazine. He wrote more than one thousand pages of commentary on the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>, which were unfortunately lost somehow. His grand opus was <em>Śrī&shy;mad Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>. When he finished the first three volumes of the First Canto, in which he included everything necessary to make one Kṛṣṇa conscious, the time was ripe to fulfill the mission of Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;tisiddhānta Sa&shy;ra&shy;sva&shy;tī and go to the Western countries.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp107" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was having dreams in which his spiritual master would come to him and say, “Come with me! Take <em>san&shy;nyā&shy;sa</em>!” Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda would wake up from the dream and think, “Take <em>san&shy;nyā&shy;sa</em>! Oh, how terrible!” But after a while he realized that this might be the only means to preach. One of his God&shy;bro&shy;thers, Śrī&shy;la Ke&shy;śa&shy;va M&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja, told Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda that unless one becomes a <em>san&shy;nyā&shy;sī</em>, it is not possible to preach everywhere. Therefore Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda entered the renounced order of life, started producing the <em>Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em>, and prepared to go West.

Regardless of where you are in the line of followers of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda, it is your responsibility to print and distribute his books in mass quantities throughout the world. This was his desire, the desire of his spiritual master, and the desire of all the <em>ācā&shy;ryas</em>, and therefore it is also our desire. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's books are not just for one generation. He said that he was writing these books as the law books for the next ten thousand years.

Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda wrote these books to be read by all people, in all places, and at all times.

<h3><em>Symptoms of a <em>Sādhu</em></em></h3>

<div id="pp112" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
During the Kārt&shy;ti&shy;ka festival of 1972, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda lectured daily at the Rā&shy;dhā-Dā&shy;mo&shy;da&shy;ra temple from <em class="em">The Nectar of Devotion</em>. He sat under the same tree the Go&shy;svā&shy;mīs used to sit under and discuss topics about Kṛṣṇa and how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda said that once he was sitting in front of Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mī's <em>sa&shy;mā&shy;dhi</em> and Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mī personally told him to go and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp113" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
At that time, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was already into the retirement years. Nowadays, they retire people at the age of sixty or sixty-five and give them retirement benefits, because they can no longer work efficiently and earn their pay. But Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was writing <em>Śrī&shy;mad-Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> and performing <em>bha&shy;jana</em>-hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord under the direct inspiration and instruction of Śrī&shy;la Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mī. And now in his old age, he was going to America.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp114" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
By going West, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda displayed the symptoms of a saintly personality, a <em>sādhu</em>. A real <em>sādhu</em> is <em>ti&shy;ti&shy;kșa&shy;vaḥ kā&shy;ru&shy;ņi&shy;kāḥ su&shy;hṛ&shy;daḥ sar&shy;va-de&shy;hi&shy;nām</em>. <em>Ti&shy;ti&shy;kṣa&shy;vaḥ</em>—tolerant; <em>kā&shy;ru&shy;ņi&shy;kāḥ</em>—merciful; <em>su&shy;hṛ&shy;daḥ sar&shy;va-de&shy;hi&shy;nām</em>—the best well-wishing friend of all living entities.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp115" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was so tolerant. While following the order of his spiritual master and going to America, he tolerated much suffering and difficulty. First, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean by boat. I know what it means to be on a boat. Once I took a ferry from Sweden to Poland. It took twenty-seven hours. I spent the ferry ride as sick as ten dogs. After that, I swore that I would never take a boat again as long as I live, and I haven't. If you just mention a boat, I get seasick. Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda, on the other hand, was on a cargo carrier for thirty-eight days. While at sea, he tolerated severe seasickness and several heart attacks. But he was assured of Kṛṣṇa's protection. Kṛṣṇa and all of His incarnations appeared to him in a dream. They were in another boat, pulling him through the water and encouraging him onward with the words, “Yes, you must go to America.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp116" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
After arriving in America, he first stayed with a family who didn't know anything about Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then at a YMCA. Then, without friends, money, or facilities, he went to the most degraded place in New York City—the Bowery. In this hellish place, as well as in the equally hellish Lower East Side, there were many obstacles, but he went on with his preaching. He worked hard, even cooking for the devotees and distributing <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em> to them, because he was <em>kā&shy;ru&shy;ņi&shy;kaḥ</em>—merciful.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp117" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
We are all made of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's mercy. Without his great tolerance and mercy, we would never have received this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Who in the history of Gau&shy;ḍī&shy;ya Vaiṣ&shy;ṇ&shy;avism or before that ever even thought of going to the Western world and preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Śrī&shy;la Bhak&shy;ti&shy;vi&shy;no&shy;da Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra had introduced Kṛṣṇa consciousness by sending books to the West, but nobody had ever gone there to preach to the <em>mle&shy;cchas</em> and <em>ya&shy;va&shy;nas</em>, live among them, and make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. We can never glorify Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda enough, because if he had not come, none of us would be here today. We would still be rotting in the material world, performing obnoxious activities. We all know perfectly well what we would be doing if it had not been for Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda. We owe our lives to him. Therefore we should completely surrender our entire lives at the lotus feet of the Founder-Ācā&shy;rya of this society, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda. This will make us qualified to satisfy the previous <em>ācā&shy;ryas</em> and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing more is to be gained in the world than this.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp118" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's mood was simple to understand. He was in the mood of Pra&shy;hlā&shy;da M&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja. Once in South Africa, while Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was writing the section of <em>Śrī&shy;mad Bhā&shy;ga&shy;va&shy;tam</em> that tells of Pra&shy;hlā&shy;da M&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja, I happened to mention, "Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda, you are always absorbed in the mood of Pra&shy;hlā&shy;da M&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja,” and he said, “Yes, I am always thinking of how to save these fools and rascals.” We can read about Pra&shy;hlā&shy;da M&shy;hā&shy;rā&shy;ja and try to enter into his mood. Then we will understand the mood of the preacher, whose only concern is to give Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the people of this world.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp119" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The disciple should want to share the mood of his spiritual master to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world. That is why we travel from town to town and village to village with Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's books, expanding Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's preaching mission and bringing new people to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. By doing this the disciple can become perfect. This is the real meaning of mercy—to only think of the best thing for people's Kṛṣṇa consciousness and to try to help them advance in spiritual life.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp120" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
To spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda continually traveled worldwide, writing and preaching wherever he went. It was a great austerity, but because he felt love and compassion for all living entities, <em>su&shy;hṛ&shy;daḥ sar&shy;va-de&shy;hi&shy;nām</em>, preaching was his life. He was preaching early every morning by writing his transcendental purports, he was preaching during the morning walk, and he continued preaching by giving morning class. All day and night, in every activity and at every opportunity, Pra&shy;bhupāda was preaching. He was always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's philosophy, Kṛṣṇa's words, and preaching Kṛṣṇa's glories. Everything he saw would remind him of a philosophical point, with which he would expand our consciousness and understanding of Kṛṣṇa. It was wonderful to have his association and hear his explanations.

Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was not only learned, but he also gave us everything in his books. He translated the texts from the original Sanskrit and manifested his emotional ecstasies in incomparable purports. When people open their minds and begin to read Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda's words, his great love and mercy enter and gradually change their hearts.

Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda is so pleased that we are printing his books in all different languages. We just print books and fill up the warehouses, never worrying about printing too many books. We often have a competition between the BBT devotees and the distributors: the BBT devotees are only happy when the warehouse is full of books, and the distributors are only happy when the warehouse is completely empty. We have so much work ahead of us. We have so many books to be distributed

Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was the first book distributor. He went to America with almost nothing except two wooden cases of his transcendental books. By selling them, he managed to survive. Later, when the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books were printed, he was the first one to distribute them. During the 1970 Ratha-yā&shy;trā in San Francisco, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda was on the stage, and someone brought the first ten copies up to him. Pra&shy;bhupāda announced: “Now an important moment in history has come. For the first time these beautifully bound <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books are available in the English language. Who will come up and take these books? Ten dollars each. And I will sign them!” Hundreds of people ran up to the stage with ten dollar bills in their hands. The books were sold in an instant, and he didn't even keep a copy for himself. This is <em>su&shy;hṛ&shy;daḥ sar&shy;va-de&shy;hi&shy;nām</em>.

Nowadays, when we want to start a new project, we need a pile of money in the bank and so much paraphernalia before we can do anything. What now takes many of us to do, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda did by himself. He is the personification of Kṛṣṇa's mercy, and he descended into this world just to perform this most ecstatic mission. Therefore we want to develop attachment to his lotus feet and go on with his mission.

<h3><em>The Tradition Continues</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp126" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The mission that Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda has given us originally came from Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu. Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya says in the <em>Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya-ca&shy;ri&shy;tā&shy;mṛ&shy;ta</em>, <em>Adi-lilā</em>, Chapter Nine, “I order every person within this universe to take up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and spread it everywhere.” If you do that - and it is not difficult to do—then Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya is ready to throw mercy all over you.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp127" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I can remember a graphic illustration of this mercy, as it descends through Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda. We were smuggling books into the former East Germany, an activity for which one could go to jail for at least fifteen years. We went through the border in two vans. I went through with entry status and the other van went through with transit status. We both had the same model of van, old Ha&shy;nu&shy;mag Hen&shy;schels, which we used at Schloss Ret&shy;ter&shy;shof for book distribution. The transit van was filled with boxes of books, and I was alone in the completely empty entry van. The border guard got suspicious when he looked into my van because there wasn't a single thing in it except the car papers. I didn't even have a suitcase, because there would not be enough room for anything else in the van when we filled it with books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp128" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
According to our plan, we would meet at the first rest area that was open. The other van arrived before me because going through transit was quicker than going through entry. We met and parked the two vans right next to each other. We were just going to take the books out when a police car came into the rest area. Trying to look calm and innocent, we took some apples and sat under a tree. The police were looking at us and the vans again and again. They could plainly see that one van was empty and the other piled up with boxes, but they must have thought that it looked innocent, because they went on their way.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp129" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When they left, we immediately piled all the books into my van, and I drove off. After about five kilometers, I saw the police car by the side of the road and one of the policemen, standing by the car with a walkie-talkie. When he saw me, he started waving his hands for me to stop. I thought, “Now I am finished. I have entry status and not transit, and the van is filled with illegal books. This means the end." I figured that it would be better to outrace these people than it would be to go to jail for fifteen years. After all, it looked as though I would go to jail anyway. Pretending not to see the policeman, I looked straight ahead and just kept on driving. As soon as I went over the first hill, I pushed the gas pedal to the floor and went full speed ahead, 130 kilometers per hour, down the East German autobahn, waiting for the flashing light of the police car to appear in my rear-view mirror.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp130" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Then, all of a sudden, Kṛṣṇa, out of His extraordinary mercy, started pouring down a thunderstorm bigger than had ever been seen in the history of mankind, and it had been so hot that day that the rain immediately caused steam to rise from the autobahn. Steam was everywhere, thunder was booming, lightning was flashing, and I was surfing down the road as fast as I could go. I pulled off at the first exit, which was illegal with my entry status (I was supposed to use only the exit designated for my destination), and I screamed down the road toward Leipzig to deliver the books. By Kṛṣṇa's arrangement, the police car must have been caught in the midst of the storm, and no one was following me.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp131" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I arrived in Leipzig at about nine-thirty at night. It was dark. I ran up to the house of the devotee who was to receive the books. I banged on his window, and he came out all groggy. I said, “I have some books. Are you ready for them?” He said, "OK,” and I ran back to unload the van. Although the books were so heavy that two men had had to load each box into the van, I was so full of adrenaline that I picked up a box all by myself, ran up to the house, and threw it through the window. It hit this devotee in the chest, and he fell, moaning, to the floor. I kept running back and forth as fast as I could with boxes of books from the van, which was under a street light because there was nowhere else to park. I kept throwing the boxes through the window, and he kept falling to the floor. Finally his little room was so full of books that he had no more place to stay, and I said, “Good-bye. See you tomorrow, if I can.”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp132" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I ran to the van and drove off, thinking, "I have done it. I'm safe. There is no problem.” Then, after driving around until two in the morning to get to a campground, I went to sleep. I was sleeping dead away, when around five-thirty in the morning, I heard on the window: Knock, knock, knock. “Oh, no," I thought. “It's not happening!” I heard it again: Knock, knock, knock. And someone said my name. I had to get up. “This is it,” I thought. “They have found me out. They took my license plate number, found out at the border who was in the car, and tracked me down to this campground. I'm finished. This is the end." Then I opened the door, and a man said, “You have a telephone call.” I replied, “Oh, really, how nice!" I got up and went to the telephone. It was Bhak&shy;tibhūṣaṇa Swami, who was then Su&shy;cand&shy;ra dāsa. He knew where I was because I had told him where I planned to stay. He informed me that Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhupāda had called from America and wanted me to meet him in London the very next day to become his secretary. I could understand that just because we tried to do a little service of smuggling books, Kṛṣṇa was directly offering His transcendental mercy.

<h3><em>An Echo Throughout the Universe</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp134" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to come to the topmost platform of love in separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu brought this understanding along with the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement for the benefit of all living entities. Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Himself was absorbed in this mood; therefore His devotees are following in His footsteps by continuing to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world with love in separation.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp135" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Kṛṣṇa enjoys in the spiritual world, but He also has some feeling of suffering. This is a wonderful thing. How can Kṛṣṇa suffer? Kṛṣṇa cannot suffer. Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya cannot suffer. But He feels suffering in the sense that He wants to give His mercy to all the fallen souls. He is thinking, "Why are these foolish living entities suffering in the material world? When are they ever coming back to Me?”
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp136" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Once Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya lamented in this way to Ha&shy;ri&shy;dā&shy;sa Ṭhā&shy;ku&shy;ra, who intelligently replied, "My dear Lord, You already delivered all the living entities when you were in the Jhā&shy;ri&shy;khan&shy;da forest.” When Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya was walking around in the Jhā&shy;ri&shy;khan&shy;da forest, He made all the animals dance. Tigers, lions, elephants, birds, and rabbits were dancing and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa together. Even deadly enemies, like tigers and deer, were hugging and kissing each other. This vibration of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> set in motion by Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya echoed throughout the universe. Soon all the living entities, both moving and non&shy;mo&shy;ving, were vibrating the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em>. In this way, Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya delivered living entities all over the universe and sent them back to Godhead. Then immediately those living entities who had not had manifested forms took such forms and filled up the spaces in the universe.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp137" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
So now, as Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya's devotees, our business is to continue that process and again clean the living entities out of the universe and send them all back home, back to Godhead.
