  <h3>Introduction</h3>

          <p class="txt">
 Rama breaks Shiva's bow when he wanted to examine the tautness of its
          bowstring. Janaka is perplexed, while others swooned at the blast of breaking bow, and
          Janaka proposes Seetha to Rama in marriage. On the approval of Vishvamitra to that
          proposal, Janaka sends his plenipotentiaries to Ayodhya.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 A bow has a definite height and it is a measure of length, from the ages even
  up to the age Kautilya, who gave many accounts for weights and measures, in his 'Artha Shāstra'
  a Penguin re-publication. Four <em>aratni-s</em> cubits are one <em>dhanu</em>, a bow-length,
  where one <em>aratni</em> is 18 inches, thus a bow-length is 6 feet and above, taking the
  standard size of archer as a six-footer and a little above. The bow's height is the height of the
  archer plus one measure of his head's height, as the upper end has to tower the archer's head.
  That being so, this bow belongs to Shiva and its height must be placed more than the human
  measure of 6 feet, and then it must be some 8 to 10 feet. And 'Rama is no crane-legged boy, as
  hisphysique is said to be of 'medium' size, and then how a boy of, say of 4, 41/2 feet, could
  catch the upper end of 8-10 feet bow to bend it...' is the objection. An archer has to stand the
  bow on ground, clutch its lower end under big toe, and with one hand, he has to bend it, while
  with the other he catches the bowstring to string the other end. He is not supposed to handle it
  like a holdall or a briefcase. For this objection it is said in a way that the poet is using the
  adjective <em>mahātmā</em> to Rama, ' an unfathomable one with an equally unfathomable soul...
  inasmuch as his duty is concerned...' The minute he touched the bow, it became a spongy stick and
  it listened to him and bent as he wished. Other way round, Rama is an ambidextrous archer and
  furthered is his skill by his possession of some divine missiles as given by Vishvamitra. Hence,
  his dexterity is now multiplied and he can handle any divine or human bow 'effortlessly...'</p>

  <p class="comment">
 The bow is not broken by itself because of its oldness or dryness, but let us
  blame Rama for breaking it, as with any other toy which children are apt to damage in their
  playing. He stretched the bowstring so long until it broke. Neither his&nbsp; mother&nbsp; nor father
  available here. Otherwise, a 'moral class' would have chanced on him for braking articles in
  neighbour's houses. The bow is broken in the middle, not at either end, but at handgrip. This
  shows the strength of his palm to handgrip.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 We can write more words for the above sound as, 'Dhām, Dhīm, Phut, and
  Diṣkū...' etc., as long as thesaurus permit. But all that will be nonsensical. An ear-splitting
  sound has come but it is "Oṃ" the auspicious sonus prima grata, produced once upon a time by
  Shiva's drum, in order to emanate words through <em>maheshvara sūtrāṇi</em>, which were
  unintelligible even for the sages like Sanaka, Sananda, Sanat Kumāra et al., and which were
  deciphered by Nandi, the Holy Bull vehicle of Shiva, to those sages. Here it is Shiva's bow and
  name of Shiva and all letters that attaches to Him are <em>shaṃ, sha.nkara, shaṃbhava</em>, are
  peace-making letters, as codified in <em>AUṃ namaḥ
  shambhave ca mayo bhave ca namaḥ sha~Nkarāya ca mayaskarāya ca namaḥ shivāya ca shivatarāya
  ca | - rudram - soma sūkta - yajur</em>&nbsp; Hence the real sound of <em>Om</em> is
  audible and it is ear-splitting for ordinary audience, since ordinary people cannot possibly face
  realities, and it is a regularly audible sound for the other four who have not swooned. By the
  way, it will be impossible for us to listen the chanting of Veda-s, even in these days, in any
  Vedic school for at least half an hour, as our ears are untuned to their <em>ghana pāṭha</em> or
  <em>jaṭa</em> or other sorts of chanting. We feel stranded in some audio studio with fully loaded
  sound FX.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 And the pacemaker Rama lifted the bow of the peacemaker Shiva, where the bow
  itself is "Om". The legendary Indian bow is composed of three parts, unlike Robin Hood's
  single-piece bow. The lower bowing part, upper bowing part combined by a grip handle, and the
  bowstring. The three pieces are comparable to the three letters syllabified "Om" - <em>a u
  ma</em>, where <em>a</em> is upper bowing piece of bow, <em>u</em>, the lower end, and
  <em>ma</em>, the bowstring. The painters usually paint this bow-breaking scene, where Rama will
  be still handling the upper end in his hand, while the lower part will be falling, and the
  bowstring will be still dangling onto the upper end. The upper part of bow is <em>a</em> and this
  <em>a</em> is Vishnu <em>akāra artho viṣṇuḥ</em>, and the dangling bowstring is <em>ma</em>
  Goddess Lakshmi, <em>loka mātā mā ramā mangala devatā</em>, dangling on the Supreme Person
  through thick and thin, and the detached-un-detached lower end is <em>u</em>, Lakshmana, or any
  other adherer. A lengthy account of this trilogy is provided in Aranya Kanda, ch. 11, first
  verse.</p>

  <p class="comment">
 And the pacemaker Rama is marrying the world with peace, by stringing the
  bowstring of peacemaker's bow, and it is not a mere marriage of some prince charming, with a
  charmy princess. Thus, this sound is the initial impact, impetus, brunt, or whatever, for
  universal peace, and that way this marriage attains a legendary significance in peace process,
  though by force.</p>

  in dealings with his new wife and old parents... and bridegroom's relatives require of him good
  demeanour... and other people wish to have dough of cooked pulse-gram, marriage-feasts,
