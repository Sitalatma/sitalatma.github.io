<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 63<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama laments while searching for Seetha and reminiscing over his past, which was spent happily with 
Seetha. Rama and Lakshmana search for her at riversides of Godavari but she is unseen there. Though 
Lakshmana continuously encourages Rama for a thorough search without submitting to mere anguish, Rama 
sinks into his own anguish.</p>

He is recollecting his romantic dalliances with Seetha at the riverside of Godavari. <em>asmin</em>

but, she who is used to have an upper hand... hence, then I became secondary...&#39; <em>udāra shīlā</em> 
&#39;well-mannered&#39; Seetha... for she did not bother me for such a frolicking when we were in Ayodhya, and

laughter... that declare me as a defeated one...&#39; And then <em>tvām bahu vākya jāta āha</em> &#39;she

was saying to you... &#39;you two are mightier than the mighty, but I am a woman, you two are males and 
can hunt the cruellest animals, but I am woman, a rabbit in the kitchen... but, see how I defeated your

&#39;A very interesting and linguistically important case of a prepositional verb is provided by the verses 
[that contain] <em>upopaviṣṭa... upa vish...</em> originally must have meant &#39;to sit near&#39;. In course 
of time, the idea of closeness or proximity was lost and it came to be used in the sense of sitting 
only. Now when the idea of nearness or proximity had to be expressed one more <em>upa</em> was prefixed 
to it. Thus, we see how tautological tendencies were influencing Sanskrit in the very hoary past. The 
Ramayana <em>upopaviṣṭa</em> has its parallel n Hindi <em>pās baiṭhnā</em> [where] <em>baiṭhnā</em> 
is <em>upa veshana</em> which itself means to sit near <em>upa= pās</em>. But still <em>pās</em> is 
used with <em>baiṭhnā...&#39;</em> The Ramayana, A Linguistic Study, Pt. Satya Vrat. And to supplement 
Panditji&#39;s above saying, even in English this is evident and Oxford in saying meaning for proximity, 
says &#39;sat in close proximity to them&#39; where &#39;proximity&#39; itself is one <em>upa</em> and &#39;close&#39; is another
<em>upa...</em> Thus tautology is same everywhere.</p>
