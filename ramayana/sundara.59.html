<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 59<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Describing the plight of Seetha to his fellow monkeys, Hanuma expresses his feeling that 
it behoved them all to see Rama only after restoring Seetha from Lanka. Hanuma says that even single-handed, 
he is capable of destroying that City of Lanka with its troops of demons, and killing Ravana, much more 
so when accompanied by heroic, mighty and powerful monkeys. Then, he recounts the past heroic exploits 
of Jambavan, Angada, Neela, Panasa, ṃainda and Dvivida. Hanuma thus incites them all to decide consciously 
of a war against Lanka.</p>
