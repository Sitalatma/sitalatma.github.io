<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Sage Vishwamitra travels to ṃithila kingdom to attend a ritual of King 
			Janaka and also to see the auspicious bow of Shiva that is being worshipped 
			in the palace of Janaka from ages. The other sages suggest to Rama, 
			that he too may go over there along with them to see that marvellous 
			bow. They all proceed from Siddha Ashram towards River Soṇa, a tributary 
			of Ganga, and camp on its bank for a night.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			The sages are not insisting on Rama to come along, but advising him 
			to have a glimpse of that marvellous bow of Shiva, which none can lift 
			to string, so far. The topic of Seetha is also not brought out by them, 
			either, because it is in the know of Vishvamitra alone, and not known 
			to these sages. Kings and princes have their own protocol of proper 
			invitation. Here a third party is inviting Rama to some other king&#39;s 
			ritual, which Rama may reject for being a prince. But it is suggestive 
			to say the maxim <em>an āhūto adhvaryam gacchet</em> &#39;even uninvited 
			can attend a Vedic-ritual...&#39; Thus the sages are tempting, rather than 
			inviting Rama to come to ṃithila in the name of a divine bow, seeing 
			which any valiant prince would easily get excited to string.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			This is the bow of Shiva with which He destroyed the ritual of Daksha.
