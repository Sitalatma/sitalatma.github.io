title=Saṅkīrtana Management

sub=Saṅkīrtana Devotees Are Especially Dear

All devotees are dear to the Supreme Lord because they engage in His devotional service, but the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are especially dear because they instruct people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees should be specially cared for, because they support the temple economically and spiritually. This means the temple president makes sure that they have the best equipment to perform their mission and that they get nice treatment in the temple.

sub=Śrīla Prabhupāda's Economic Scheme

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted book distribution to maintain this movement. Other businesses are not Prabhupāda's scheme. I heard him say many times how he wanted it done: First the BBT prints the books and charges you one hundred percent more than the production cost. Then you distribute the books for one hundred percent more than the BBT price. You maintain your temple on fifty percent of your income and fifty percent goes to the BBT. Then the BBT uses fifty percent of its income to print more books, so that every book that goes out is replaced. Thus you can distribute unlimited books and the BBT will just keep printing. If followed, this principle makes economic problems disappear, and following it is easy. First make book distribution the sole economic scheme. <em>Gṛhasthas</em> living outside can devise other schemes if they wish, but the temple devotees should make money only from book distribution. If book distribution is the sole means of income, and they sell the books for the right price, twice the BBT price, then they can use half the money for books and half for the temple. The price might be adjusted by the local GBC if the books must go out as fast as possible or the people haven't got enough money to pay for them, but the temple will have some economic troubles because of this and will have to adjust. If a temple manages to live on the basis of book distribution by the fifty-fifty principle, however, then more and more devotees can be persuaded to sell more and more books because nobody needs to do anything else to bring in money. The BBT will become bigger and bigger, the projects in India will come closer and closer to completion, and Lord Caitanya, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and Śrīla Prabhupāda will all be very pleased because Prabhupāda wanted the projects like Mayapur to be built through book distribution. He said that if we kept doubling book distribution every year, we would have enough funds to build a big temple in Mayapur.

sub=Back to the Basics

Sometime in 1975, Śrīla Prabhupāda was in Bombay, and I was sitting in his room when one GBC man came in and presented Prabhupāda with a scheme to distribute all the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛtas</em> being printed at full speed. He said that since the books had a striking appearance and the contents were highly advanced, the devotees would have problems distributing them; furthermore, the BBT needed the capital to print these books and at the same time donate seventy-five thousand dollars a month to the Bombay construction. His scheme was to give out books without regard for the donation size and cover the missing portion of the price with other collection methods. I don't think the forceful presentation of this scheme disturbed Prabhupāda, but he was not happy when he heard that his books would be given away for less than their value. Prabhupāda was adamant that no books should be given away for free. People should pay for them; otherwise they would not respect them. But when the GBC man said, “Well, Prabhupāda, if we don't do this, book distribution will decrease by two-thirds,” Prabhupāda looked down at the floor in what seemed to me to be sad resignation and said, “If it will decrease the distribution, do as you must." In my mind the idea is fixed that Prabhupāda felt somewhat threatened. I have kept this to myself throughout the years so as not to make a scene about it, but the image remains burned into my mind, and Prabhupāda's desire is clear.

We have to understand the desire of the spiritual master: his desire is to distribute books. If his disciples are too rock-headed to understand the whole principle, then his attitude is, “All right, what can I say? After all, you are doing the service.” Since we were sitting right next to Prabhupāda at that moment, and since he expressed his desire in many ways, we want to strictly follow Śrīla Prabhupāda's original ideas without any mental concoction. We are asking you to take up this program because it was Prabhupāda's idea, and if you do, everything will be spiritually and economically solid. Śrīla Prabhupāda saw book distribution as the spiritual and economic basis of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Whenever anybody asked him how he supported this big organization, he would say, "We are distributing three <em>lakhs</em> of books a day. In this way we support all our temples.” He repeated it thousands of times to any Indian who would ask. Yet nowadays what temple supports itself by books? The spiritual master says that it is done by books, but the disciple does it by paintings, bumper stickers, and stamps. So it may be troublesome for you, but we will take the trouble to get back to what Prabhupāda wanted. He said, “Just distribute books and everything will come,” and it is a fact. From book distribution comes money, preaching opportunities, new devotees. People read the books and become favorable. We cannot understand the depth or reach of these books. Therefore I insist that book distribution be our main preaching. It was Prabhupāda's desire and he told me so. We don't need to hear anything else. We will print, distribute, and try our best to maintain our temples with Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

sub=The Best Business

Book distribution is the only hope for maintaining our society, because distribution of paraphernalia—paintings, bumper stickers, or whatever people are distributing nowadays—will not give us strength. People will look at this and laugh at us: “Look at these so-called spiritual people. They engage in all sorts of paraphernalia sales just to make money.” Also the devotees will develop a fruitive mentality and their spiritual life will diminish, because they don't have a direct connection to the preaching mission.

One may manage to collect a lot of money from paraphernalia sales and start an opulent center. But then one depends on a high level of income to maintain it. And this is difficult because devotees cannot continue to stay out late and associate with <em>karmis</em> in unpleasant circumstances. They gradually give up, and one cannot replace them because such activities do not attract new devotees. Then one takes out loans, thinking that they can be paid back later on, but the center just becomes more and more overextended and soon collapses. We have seen it happen again and again.

On the other hand, book distribution strengthens spiritual life. The devotees who go out and sell books become enlivened, ecstatic, and regulated in sleeping and rising. They are able to chant properly and associate with the other devotees. They are not on programs in which they go to bed at midnight or one in the morning and get up at eight or nine o'clock as all the other devotees are walking out the door. All the devotees connected with the book distribution become strong together. And they are interested in reading the books because they are distributing them all the time.

Nobody has gotten on the case of any temple for distributing books. And the money from distributing books has never become the target of the tax authorities or government people as long as it has been collected in a fairly decent manner. Straightforward book distribution never disturbed anybody anywhere in the world, because it is understood that we are selling our books as part of our religion. Money made in that way is secure, because it is untouchable and usually tax exempt.

Śrīla Prabhupāda said that book distribution is the best business. He even said that our householders could maintain themselves by distributing books and could take a commission, fifteen percent or whatever is required to maintain themselves. Of course, that was in Prabhupāda's time. Today it is more like fifty percent. In this way they have a personal income and are not dependent on the temple. They give money to the temple, and they support the BBT. It is the best occupational duty for every householder in the movement. It is the way that all householders can have their own places, do a lot of preaching, and be very satisfied in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

sub=Preaching Against Book Distribution Is Insanity

When we were preaching in Poland, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “I know your preaching is successful because you are distributing so many of my books.” If someone preaches against book distribution, he must be insane because Prabhupāda's greatest desire was to have his books distributed. Everyone knows it. No research is required. But some choose to remember it and others choose to forget it. We distribute books on the order of the superior authority—the preaching mission depends on it. Therefore everyone giving orders in ISKCON should pass on the order of the higher authority that everyone engage in the preaching mission, of which book distribution is the topmost activity. We should distribute these books like mad, and this will bring people's consciousness to the transcendental platform and change the world.

sub=Creating a Saṅkīrtana Atmosphere

I see my role in the book distribution mission as making sure that all the activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in all the temples are directed toward getting out as many books as possible and making sure that all the devotees understand that this is the main goal: we have to bring more and more people to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by giving them Prabhupāda's books. To do this we have to create an atmosphere in which book distribution is seen as very, very important work.

Actually, from the material point of view, nobody wants to go out and sell books. It is strenuous. It is difficult meeting adverse conditions and people. This is an important consideration. Unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he will want to do things according to his material inclinations more than anything else. Therefore inspiring the devotees to go out is not easy if the atmosphere in the temples is unfavorable to book distribution. If all the devotees are busily engaged according to their propensities, a potential book distributor might think, “Why should I struggle to distribute books?” Therefore one has to create an atmosphere in which everyone can understand with his transcendental intelligence that book distribution is the most important activity, that it is going to bring the supreme results and please Śrīla Prabhupāda and take us all back to Godhead. It is the primary purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and Prabhupāda said that enough times so that everyone can understand it.

Yet it is important to preach in such a way that devotees who don't distribute books can feel they are connected to book distribution. Our managers have to help everybody understand this. For example, the <em>pūjārī</em> department worships the Deity and assures us of the Lord's mercy, and we aspire to please the Deities and want to distribute the books for Their satisfaction. Therefore at the end of the week we read our book scores to Them. And the cooks prepare <em>prasādam</em> to give everybody strength and enthusiasm. Especially in December practically all of us simply engage in book distribution just to make sure we keep up the spirit of understanding what the topmost part of preaching is.

sub=Old Distributors Never Die

<strong>Devotee:</strong> If book distribution is the topmost activity, why do most devotees give it up after some years? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> There are many reasons to give up book distribution, and none of them are bona fide. I know many old book distributors who are still book distributors. Sometimes, because the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men are the most qualified, we make an older <em>saṅkīrtana</em> man temple president. Then he becomes not only the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader for a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> group, but for the whole temple. He hasn't given up. He may not be able to go out all the time and distribute books himself, but he inspires everyone else to participate in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. And that is glorious.

One should never give up the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Even if a devotee has to give up direct street distribution because his body is broken down from carrying tons of books, he can still help others to go out and distribute books. Only the form of distribution has changed. To engage everybody else in book distribution is a higher service than to be engaged in it oneself, and only one sincerely committed to the book distribution mission can do it. Someone not convinced may talk big and inspire the devotees for ten minutes or so, but they soon realize he is a nonsense and forget about him. But a real book distributor at heart can inspire hundreds of thousands of people to distribute Prabhupāda's books. Old <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees never die—they live forever in their instructions.

An old distributor can make preaching programs, inspiring people to start <em>nāma-haṭṭa</em> centers and distribute books themselves. He can also encourage the <em>nāma-haṭṭīs</em> to read the books, for the more they read and study the books the more they will want to distribute them. Can you imagine when we have a network of <em>nāma-haṭṭa</em> centers all over the place, and in each of these centers a couple goes out and distributes maybe twenty books a week? It doesn't sound like much, but if you have a hundred centers, that is two thousand books a week distributed by householders going from door to door in their own neighborhoods. Can you imagine, little by little, a huge book distribution network spreading over every country, flooding every place with books?

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees should pray to the Lord for the strength to continue even though their bodies are aging. After ten or fifteen years on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, you should not give up, thinking, “Now I'm too old.” No, you are still not old. Prabhupāda used to say that old is when you are in your seventies. Of course, from his point of view it was like that. So if you are an old man and your hair is gray and you need a cane to walk, you can still preach and inspire more and more people to distribute books. This is actually the way a book distributor thinks. He thinks that his whole life will be engaged in distributing Prabhupāda's books.

sub=Special Delivery

Eating, drinking, and being merry you can do in any body, but only in the human form of life can you go back home, back to Godhead. We want to give out billions and trillions of books, because we don't want people to eat, drink, be merry, and tomorrow die. We want them to eat <em>prasādam</em>, drink nectar, be merry in <em>kīrtana</em>, and tomorrow go back home, back to Godhead. Therefore we will not be satisfied until every house has a full set and a spare set, and we are not going to rest until this has been done. We may become so old that we need a young <em>brahmacārī</em> to carry our book bag, but we will still be giving out the books. We will go on until we drop dead on the street with a book in our hand. Then a special crew with a special van will pick up our dead body and deliver us to a special place where all the <em>samādhis</em> for <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are. We will be put in our <em>samādhi</em> with that last book along with a flower garland on our chest, and a nice <em>samādhi</em> building will be built over us. Isn't that nice? So just go on with this transcendental mission that Śrīla Prabhupāda has given us, and everything will become very wonderful.

sub=Fresh Blood

No matter how well we do, the same devotees going out year after year become old. Of course, old <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees never die, they just go on distributing, but due to the age factor they may do a little less or a different kind of book distribution. Therefore to keep the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement increasing we must always be on the alert to make new devotees. When new devotees are in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> parties, their enthusiasm will inspire all the devotees. But how do new devotees come to the temple? They come through preaching programs. Therefore many preaching programs should be arranged. One or two expert preachers can go around and attract people to visit the temple. The whole purpose of preaching programs is to make new devotees. And when those new devotees are around, we should gradually bring them out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. When the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party increases, we can have really successful <em>saṅkīrtana</em>

Therefore the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have to cooperate with the preachers. If you meet somebody who looks nice—I don't mean an old housewife with a bag of groceries, I mean a seventeen- to twenty-five-year-old person who is not entangled yet with family, house, job, and all of that—get that person's address and make sure the preachers contact him or her. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have to cooperate and collect addresses even though it takes five minutes out of their distribution. It is worth it in the long run. One has to see every person as a potential devotee and gradually develop the base of devotees, so that more and more <em>saṅkīrtana</em> can go on. This is essential, and everyone should be praying all the time to the Lord to increase the number of devotees.

Desire is the main factor in increasing book distribution. The more one desires it, the more one prays to Kṛṣṇa for help to accomplish it. And Kṛṣṇa reciprocates by sending qualified devotees. If these new devotee candidates are properly trained in the process of book distribution and are nicely performing this service, Kṛṣṇa will see that we are serious to increase the preaching, and He will send more <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and women to expand the book distribution even more. Kṛṣṇa is the perfect reciprocator. He showers unlimited help and facilities upon us when He sees that we are using His gifts in a proper way.

sub=The Bhakta Program

Generally no one should go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> immediately after joining. Those who join the temple must undergo a period of purification and training in devotional life. When they are qualified as devotees and trained in the spiritual principles, then the temple president should consider sending them out on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party. The temple president should see that new devotees receive regular training in all areas of devotional life.

The <em>bhakta</em> program must train the devotees to follow the temple programs, to chant and hear, to study the basic philosophy, and to keep the temple clean, and, above all, to understand that the main mission of ISKCON is to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness by printing and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. If the <em>bhaktas</em> are continually pointed in that direction, they will learn the goals of the movement and the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda. This should be preached in the temple classes, in special <em>bhakta</em> classes, and in individual instruction. If the traveling preachers occasionally preach about the importance of book distribution, all the temple devotees will gradually learn to take up the mission themselves.

When new devotees first go out, they should distribute magazines and small books around the <em>harināma</em> party. We should not send untrained people out, because they will make mistakes. But let us say someone joins December 1st. What is he going to do? He should assist a big distributor. That is better than going on his own, because if he gets a bad taste on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, later on he will have trouble learning. It is better to learn the bliss without having to struggle.

sub=The Saṅkīrtana Leader

The primary duty of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader is to organize the <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Properly organized devotees will not waste time having two <em>saṅkīrtana</em> groups in the same place at once and will not burn places out by going to the same place too often. This is especially relevant on traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and may not be so important in the city.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader cares for the devotees' physical needs. They must be properly dressed, and they should eat ample and healthy <em>prasādam</em> that is served on time. When the devotees are properly prepared, he gives them enough books, tells them what to say and what not to say, and sends them to areas of the city or country where their abilities will be maximized. He makes sure the vehicles are properly taken care of —every car is kept clean, serviced regularly, and has working lights and sufficient rubber tread on the tires. And he keeps count of the money, so that the books can be paid for.

A good <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader invests time and energy in training new devotees. He tries his best to inspire them first to improve the quality of their distribution and then gradually their quantity. It is important that beginners get his personal association or the association of another advanced and older distributor. They should distribute right next to him and learn his techniques; although slightly artificial, it is better than doing only a few books a day. They will gradually improve and soon develop their own techniques. One should watch them and correct their mistakes. For example, if you see someone always looking down while distributing, you build up his self-confidence and tell him to look people in the face. But if someone does not improve after a month or so, you may understand that he cannot be helped and you can let him distribute what he can on his own. You practically have to be a psychiatrist in Kali-yuga.

Above all, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader should be surrendered to the order of his spiritual master and cooperate with the temple president. And then he will be a potent force in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

sub=Congregational Preaching

The purpose of sending devotees to open small temples is to attract new devotees, train them, and engage them in book distribution. That is the way Kṛṣṇa consciousness spreads everywhere. But sometimes a small preaching center does not have enough devotees to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Let us say there are only three devotees in the temple. They should go out chanting and attract new people and cultivate these people and make them into devotees. When there are six or seven devotees in the temple, then they can start distributing books.

A small temple is not an excuse to avoid <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. One can distribute books to the temple congregation and encourage them to distribute. Give them thirty, forty, or one hundred books. Although they distribute more slowly, it is a wonderful way to increase book distribution. One can also distribute books through temple shops, mail order departments, and ISKCON membership programs. Programs that include benefits such as sets of Prabhupāda's books are good sources of book distribution as well as income. Our Life Membership program has been popular amongst the Indians throughout the world, and it is a good way to get Śrīla Prabhupāda's books into their homes. As ISKCON expands its congregational preaching programs, memberships will be a good way to bring sets of books into the homes of the congregational members.

sub=Book Production

Our preaching effort begins with book production. First we make the books and then we distribute them. This is especially relevant in countries where not many books are available in the local languages. It is in the best interest of all temples to make sure the book production department is fully staffed to make as many books in the different languages as quickly as possible. The temple president should arrange for any qualified persons associated with the temple to help the BBT speed up the production. And when all Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are produced in all the local languages, the devotees can become learned in the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, remain fixed in their devotional service, and go on increasing the distribution.

sub=Bookkeeping

Every temple is responsible for paying the BBT immediately after books are received and sold. In some BBT areas, temples are responsible to pay within thirty to sixty days after receiving books. If a temple does not pay its bill on time, it acquires what is known as a bad debt, or a debt not covered by a stock of books. Temples must keep inventories, and then they can pay the BBT properly. When books are taken out of the warehouse, the number of books should be noted in a logbook, and then it should be ascertained later that the books are paid for by the distributors who took them.

One has to keep the book distribution results and papers properly, for they are the most important records in the temple treasury. All the income is made through <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Therefore the temple president should always know what is happening in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> department. A proper account of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> results should be done each week. On the basis of that accounting, the BBT must be paid each week or at least twice a month. For example, if a devotee has distributed one hundred <em>Bhagavad-gītās</em> and two hundred <em>Bhāgavatams</em>, the accountant should record that result and multiply the prices of the books times the number of books sold. He does this for all the book distributors and calculates the amount that has to be paid to the BBT that week.

Sometimes books get lost or damaged, or the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees give an improper account of the numbers of books they sold. That is why the inventory is important. One knows how many books were received from the BBT and how many were sold on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. The number of books in the warehouse should be the same number as the number of books received minus the number of books distributed. In fact, that is rarely the situation because of loss and damage or devotees not counting properly, so the temple has to periodically pay the BBT for the missing books. That is best done once a month; otherwise one falls too far behind.

No temple president can be said to be doing his job unless he pays his BBT bills regularly and on time. Not paying the BBT regularly is sufficient grounds for removal of a temple president, according to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Going into debt with the BBT is easy to do: simply don't pay the BBT for a few weeks, and then the temple is in debt. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita  said that three things must be extinguished immediately, otherwise they will destroy one—fire, debt, and disease. Debt is considered as dangerous as fire. Debts to the BBT can ruin a temple. The BBT is Śrīla Prabhupāda's heart, and the <em>lakṣmī</em> is his blood. When a temple is in debt to the BBT, it is sucking Prabhupāda's blood.

The temple president must carefully determine whether he has the money for the expenditures being made. If one does not have the money, he cannot spend it! This is a simple yet extremely important and often overlooked point, because, at least in the West, it is easy to get bank loans or credit cards and to manipulate financing and other things. This type of spending leads to carelessness. One can spend much more than he makes, if he is not careful, and soon he will find himself bankrupt. Debt greatly burdens the temple devotees. They lose spiritual enthusiasm if the temple is in debt, and the management has to push them to collect more. Devotees should be able to feel confident that the managers will prevent the temple from going into debt. When they see debts increasing, they lose faith in the management. Therefore the temple president should make it his first rule never to spend money that he does not have and go into debt for any reason. This will keep the temple financially strong and the devotees happy. Such devotees may not have many material things in the temple, but at least they will not have debts, so they can be spiritually satisfied.

sub=Distribution Zones

A regional management organization, of which all the different temple presidents are members, should come together and discuss issues such as distribution zones. It is not good for our reputation or for the spreading of Kṛṣṇa consciousness if devotees come into another temple's zone and neglect cultivating people properly. Local devotees become disturbed if distributors from other temples come into their zone and burn the place out. Therefore the regional body should make a resolution that nobody can go into another temple's zone without the permission of that zone's temple president. This is Śrīla Prabhupāda's principle, and he even said that they should give that temple a percentage of their collection. Another alternative is to make sure all the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees cultivate the people equally within their region by centralized management. That is the system we use in Germany. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees distribute wherever they like, and they feel like they have to cultivate all the people in the whole country.

sub=Legalizing Saṅkīrtana Spots

It is important for the temple president to get the distribution spots legalized. He may do this personally or through another devotee. By endeavoring through the legal system, sometimes more spots can be legalized through making the case that ISKCON does spiritual welfare work that benefits all the people in the country. A good lawyer can give advice as to whether this is feasible or not. If one is forced to accept what the local authorities give, and if that is not enough, then the devotees can travel from town to town and village to village so quickly that they don't disturb anyone. Thus one can continue distributing without problems.

sub=Traveling Saṅkīrtana

Both city <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> are good, and both expand the preaching. City <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is usually done where many <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spots are accessible by public transportation. But sometimes the temple is not in the city and one has to travel. To spread the mercy of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books not only in the crowded cities but also throughout the countryside, one gets in vans and travels from town to town, village to village. Traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> not only distributes the mercy widely, it also increases the distribution results. The only problem with traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is that one must maintain vans and rent hotel rooms, which is costly. Therefore, it may not always be possible to have traveling parties. But if it can be arranged, it is a wonderful way to spread the mercy far and wide.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees usually prefer traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, because it is easy to become entangled in different aspects of temple life, such as overly long temple programs that run on until nine o'clock or later. Thus the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have a hard time getting out the door before ten o'clock. But when they are traveling they finish their morning program early, and they get out on the street at the same time as the local people do.

Although traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is good, the temple president should make sure that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees don't become estranged from the temple. Sometimes a traveling party develops a separatist attitude and travels throughout the country independent of any temple. Therefore the temple president and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader should be on guard against that.

sub=Saṅkīrtana from the Temple

The secret to successful management is to organize the temple around preaching. Śrīla Prabhupāda stated in the early 1970's that preaching is the essence, and this is as relevant now as it was then. Without preaching there can be no ecstasy in spiritual life. Thus every temple president should organize the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books far and wide. Although he may have a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader, the president should be the super <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader and inspire all the devotees to distribute more and more.

If the temple president is intelligent, he arranges the temple program so that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are ready to go at eight-thirty or nine o'clock. That is possible if the devotees get to rest early and chant all their rounds in the morning. But one may have to accept that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees leave the temple later and perhaps return later. Then, instead of going to the evening temple program, they can read and take rest. It is best to restrict the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> class to one hour from the start of <em>Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava</em> to give all the devotees the best start on their morning activities. Similarly, the <em>Gītā</em> class should end by nine o'clock in the evening to allow everyone to take rest early. The temple president should humbly request the speakers to keep within these time limits, even visiting <em>sannyāsīs</em> or spiritual masters. Otherwise the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission will be disturbed.

The temple managers should engage <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> only. The book distributors should not be distracted by other activities. They should simply go out and distribute books, free of worries or fears about anything else. But if the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are asked to do some service in the temple, they should just do it quickly and then go out. Those supporting the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission also go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, so <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees also have to engage in support activities sometimes. They should not waste time arguing. They are generally asked to help because there are not enough devotees in the temple to do the basic things required. For example, someone has to cook, even when everybody is going on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. If everyone says, “I only go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, and I do nothing else," nobody will eat. Therefore some of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men may have to run in the kitchen and cook. Then, when everybody has eaten, they can all go out. The perfection of management is to get all the devotees, including the temple devotees, out the door.

For the temple devotees, we have instituted the once-a-week marathon. Everyone, including the temple president, goes out the door and distributes Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In that way, along with the Sunday Feast and the December Marathon, the temple is more of a preaching temple. Everyone should be attached to and feel the pressure of the preaching mission. That is very important. Therefore we should go on with once-a-week <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and the Prabhupāda Marathon and go out as much as possible. An even better program is everyone goes out one week a month, because that is seven days a month instead of four.

sub=Marathon Management Strategy

We have seen practically that a well-organized marathon is created before the marathon starts. A marathon that is organized during the marathon is a badly managed marathon. To organize a marathon means to create the parties properly, to inform all the devotees well in advance that there will be a marathon and that they are involved, to pick out the places where everyone will go, to give them vans in proper running order, to give them a stock of books and supplies and arrange to replenish them from various points, and to collect the scores and the <em>lakṣmī</em>. All these things must be organized before the marathon starts. Otherwise there will be confusion, and nothing is worse than confusion to make a marathon a real flop.

The most important item is getting everyone out. One keeps back only those few souls absolutely required to run the Deity services and preaches to them that their austerity is to work like five or ten devotees and thereby allow the others to go out. Now, devotees who are not usually on marathons sometimes feel shy or scared to go out. The thought of meeting people on the street sometimes scares them to death, and they would rather do anything else than go out. Of course, this is due to the ignorant condition of the mind alone, for when those devotees go out, eighty percent of the time they become completely ecstatic within a few days. But the manager has to make their conversion into <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees as painless as possible. So, he starts preparing the devotees at least a month in advance by dropping statements in class and elsewhere, like "Isn't it wonderful that the marathon will begin next month? Everyone will be going out, you know.” Also, one has to make a list that mentions exactly who is going out, and one has to post it clearly at least two weeks in advance for all to see.

Giving the devotees clear information about what is going to happen is the best way to keep devotees enthusiastic and satisfied. The worst thing is to spring something on devotees in the morning announcements and expect them all to surrender. This is the stupidest kind of management there is, and anyone who does that deserves the chaos that follows. Every devotee has plans for what he will do on a given day, and sometimes his plans were made weeks in advance. If the temple president says, “Now we are all going to do this today,” and gives no one a chance to explain why that is impossible, then he is a fool number one, without any respect for people. A clever manager will plan everything out a week in advance and post the activities of the next week (starting from Monday) on the bulletin board the previous Wednesday so that all devotees can plan accordingly how they will surrender.

A marathon is a perfect example of that. Warn them nicely, prepare them nicely, and help them to surrender. Sometimes make funny comments as if you were also a little worried about having to go out and face people on the street, and in this way they loosen up a bit. The more marathon information that is posted on the board as soon as it is ready, the better the marathon is. Suppose you are organizing a van or whatever that some non-marathon party is using beforehand for something else. The best thing is to have a meeting with all the parties and leaders involved three weeks before the marathon and work out all details as to members, vehicles, and supplies. This should be posted for all to see. The effect of this is that everyone gets the point: “The marathon is serious, the managers are already planning it, and I cannot escape.” Another point is that in case there is some objection to the plan, or some sharp soul sees some fault, it can be corrected before everyone goes out. Getting the battle plan perfect before going into battle is the best policy, because lives depend on it.  

Write down all the duties of those who stay back, create a temporary authority to run the minimal affairs left to run, create a backup for that temporary authority in case he falls into <em>māyā</em> alone in the temple, and teach them exactly what they have to do. Post this. Let everyone know who is in charge of what during the marathon and who they should go to and what they should expect from those persons and what they should not expect (such as a lot of money for anything). Order all required supplies far in advance. Have a supply in stock before departure and also have a mid-marathon refill if required. Have stocks of books, food, and supplies waiting at depots around the country and distribute like mad. If you organize everything like this, then there is absolutely no need for the temple managers to remain behind during a marathon. In fact, it is <em>māyā</em> if the temple managers remain behind. The temple managers should beat everyone else in the marathon, then everyone will understand their superior spiritual potency.

Prabhupāda said that the best manager is the best preacher. He who is the most potent devotee is best suited to leading others. He can never tolerate sitting around watching the walls as the others are out getting the bliss. It is simply a question of proper management before the marathon. If this is done, there are no problems. But there may be something from the <em>karmi</em> world that requires the manager to be reached by the temporary authorities. Therefore each manager should always be accessible by telephone or a beeper in emergencies. But the normal appointments should be put off until after the marathon. Usually there is little that cannot be put off to some other date by a phone call.

sub=Quotas

One should perform <em>saṅkīrtana</em> without fruitive desires. Sometimes the temple authorities think that by giving the devotees quotas, it will increase or maintain their level of distribution. But all results are up to Kṛṣṇa, and despite having a big quota, they will not be able to fulfill it without Kṛṣṇa's sanction. Therefore quotas are often counterproductive. They make the devotees fruitive. Devotees think they have to perform in a certain manner for their devotional service to be acceptable. I have heard statements like “Don't return to the temple if you don't do five hundred books this week.” That is not Kṛṣṇa conscious. One should distribute as much as he can and depend on Kṛṣṇa for the results. This is also a quota—to do as much as you can—but it is a natural quota that doesn't create any pain in the heart of the distributor or disappoint him at not reaching the goal. One should not think, “I must do so many books this week, otherwise I'm a failure.” One should simply think, “I'm Kṛṣṇa's eternal servant. In this lifetime my service is distributing as many of these wonderful books as I can. Let me fully depend on the Lord's mercy and pray to the lotus feet of my spiritual master that I can become completely attached to fulfilling his mission to distribute books.” Then he will gradually increase his distribution naturally and become happy automatically.

sub=Homogeneous Preaching

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Someone may accept that books are the basis but not that by just distributing books all the other services will develop automatically. After all, someone has to engage in the other services. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, someone has to do the other services, and we encourage all preaching. Still, if you distribute books, the facilities for all these other departments will come automatically. You just go on distributing, and as soon as you see an opportunity develop, jump on it, and use it to engage someone in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness more. In this way the whole movement grows. We don't say “just distribute books” and suddenly the other departments spring out of nothing. We are not so foolish. But we do say that by your distribution efforts, all the facilities will gradually come. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes it's said that book distribution is a complete program in itself and doesn't need anything else. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> That's a fact. It's perfectly complete in itself. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Wouldn't we be satisfied by just distributing books and not having any temples?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If there were no temples, you wouldn't be distributing books for long. When you distribute books, people want to join, and temples give them a place to join. Temples are for the devotees who cannot distribute books, especially householders and their families. Besides, they want to maintain temples. Śrīla Prabhupāda personally started the restaurant program for householders. All kinds of programs are needed in ISKCON. We don't say, “Just distribute books and forget everything else." But distributing books is the main program. As long as book distribution is going on, the other programs are safe and secure. They expand the book distribution even more. Every time someone opens a restaurant or a preaching center, more people are attracted who will also go out and distribute books. It is all working together as one homogeneous preaching program.

sub=Book Distribution and Mayapur

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How much is the BBT involved in the Mayapur Project? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The BBT doesn't manage anything in Mayapur anymore. A percentage of the BBT turnover, which right now is around twenty-five percent, is sent to the Mayapur Project Development Fund. All of this money is spent on the Mayapur Project, which includes the temple construction, the master plan development, and the buildings essential for the further development of Mayapur. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Should the devotees meditate on this project, or should they simply concentrate on book distribution?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> They should concentrate on book distribution with their hearts and souls, but they should also understand that one quarter of the value of every book distributed goes directly to the Mayapur Project. Śrīla Prabhupāda said, "First comes Vṛndāvana, then Bombay, and then Mayapur.” He wanted us to fulfill this mission of the <em>ācāryas</em>. He said that if we develop Mayapur, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura will come from the spiritual world and carry us back home to Godhead. Śrīla Prabhupāda considered the Mayapur Project so important that, in March 1977, just before he left the planet, he wanted us to start building the temple immediately, although we had no plan. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How can we increase book distribution around the world? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> I see it as a question of consciousness and support from the higher members of ISKCON. The most influential people in each zone, like the GBC men, should dedicate their lives to preaching about book distribution and the Mayapur Project. In this way they can inspire the devotees to expand their book distribution. The spiritual masters in ISKCON are presently an untapped source of inspiration. All the spiritual masters in ISKCON, whether they are GBC men, <em>sannyāsīs</em>, temple presidents, or just preachers, should give to their disciples Śrīla Prabhupāda's mission to produce books in all the languages of the world and distribute the books profusely throughout the world. The BBT could increase its remittances to Mayapur, and we could build Mayapur City more quickly, because the greatest problem we face is the lack of funds.

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted the Mayapur Temple to be financed by book distribution, and he said that we could do it by doubling every year. If the BBT were running at the normal pace right now without doubling, we could build it in fifteen years. If we doubled, we could do it in eight years. And if we doubled again, we could do it in four years. If we all saw the economic benefits, we could keep on increasing the book distribution, and benefit the BBT at the same time.

The main thing is the preaching work that should be done by the GBC men, the <em>gurus</em> to their disciples, the <em>śikṣā-gurus</em> to their followers, the <em>sannyāsīs</em> to those they influence, the temple presidents to the people in their temples, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leaders to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. Everyone should be encouraged to dedicate his life to the book distribution mission, so that we can accomplish all the goals Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted accomplished in our lifetime.

We can get the credit. Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to Arjuna, <em>mayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam eva nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin</em>: “This battle is already won. All the men are already dead. All you have to do is become an instrument in this fight, and if you are My instrument, you will accomplish the required goals.” He called him <em>savya-sācin</em>, expert at shooting arrows. Kṛṣṇa appointed Arjuna, who had the propensity to accomplish His mission, and told him, “It's already accomplished. Just become the instrument of My will and become a success.” Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all the <em>ācāryas</em>, including Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and especially Śrīla Prabhupāda, have given us this project to develop and have desired that book distribution around the world keep doubling. Thus it is already accomplished. We just have to do it and take the credit.
