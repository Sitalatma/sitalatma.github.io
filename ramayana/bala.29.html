<h3>chapter [Sarga] 29<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8 - Sep 2009</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Rama and Lakshmana inquisitively enquired into the Siddha āshrama, 
			Accomplished Hermitage in the earlier chapter for which Sage Vishvamitra 
			informs about the heritage of that hermitage for it once belonged to 
			Vishnu in Vāmna incarnation. Vishvamitra narrates about it and how 
			Vāmna, a dwarfish ascetic boy eradicated evil on earth. It is a suggestion 
			to Rama from Sage Vishvamitra to do likewise in this incarnation of 
			Rama also.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			This is firstly the hermitage of Vishnu before taking up Vāmna incarnation. 
			Later the incarnate Vāmna also practised asceticism here. Thus, this 
			hermitage belongs to both Vishnu and Vāmna, and on such an analogy 
			this even belongs to Rama at the present time, so says Vishvamitra at 
			24th verse below.</p>

			The ascetic practises conducted along with wife are said to yield best

			<p class="comment">
			The wording <em>siddhe karmaṇi</em> is interpreted in two ways. One 
			in respect of Vishnu who is practising asceticism there, as His austerities 
			are accomplished here in accepting request of gods as well as that of 
			Sage Kāshyapa. The other, in respect of Kāshyapa who is seeking the 
			boon, and if Vishnu accords the boon to incarnate Himself as Vāmna 
			in the womb of Aditi, the austerities of Kāshyapa are also accomplished. 
			Since the deeds of Supreme God are not accomplished with mere austerities, 
			but by eliminating the evil, the concept of <em>siddhe karmaṇi</em> 
			is appropriate in respect of Sage Kāshyapa. In any way, this hermitage 
			is an Accomplished one for gods, for sages, and for Supreme Divinities, 
			in taking a foothold to eliminate the evil on earth.</p>

			Bali and begs of him for a space enough to place his three dwarfish 
			foot-steps. While all around that ritual hall of Bali laugh at this 
			boy&#39;s request, Bali comes to know who this dwarfish boy is. Though known 
			to be Vishnu in this incarnation, without deviating from his vow of 
			according charities in &#39;as is where is condition&#39;, Bali accords that 
			much space to the boy. Then Vāmna places one dwarfish foot on this 
			globe and the entire globe is covered with it. Vāmna then asks Bali 
			where to put the second foot. Bali shows heavenward, which heavenly 
			worlds are conquered by Bali and are under his control at that time. 
			Vāmna places his second dwarfish foot on all the heavenly worlds covering 
			all of them. Then again, Vāmna asks Bali as to where the third foot-space 
			is. Bali shows his head to place the third foot. Vāmna places his foot 
			on this third foot-space, i.e., on Bali&#39;s head and starts to trample 
			him to <em>pātāla loka</em>, nether worlds. At the time of donating 
			the charity, while Bali is pouring water oblation into the hands of 
			Vāmna, Sage Shukrachārya, the demon&#39;s high priest, knowing this dwarf 
			boy to be Vishnu, enters the nozzle of the water pot so that the donation 
			water may not fall into the hands of the boy, thus to fail the donation. 
			Knowing that the sage is in the nozzle of the water-pot, Vāmna pierces 
			the nozzle with a straw of darbha, sacred grass-blade, thus piercing 
			one eye of Sage Shukrachārya. From then on, this sage has become one-eyed 
			sage, symbolically meaning that he eyes on one side only, namely on 
			the side of demon&#39;s welfare. Vāmna places his third step on the head 
			of Emperor Bali and subjugates him to netherworlds, freeing the other 
			worlds from his rule. However, Vishnu blesses Bali to be deathless, 
			though subdued into netherworlds, and to become Indra in the coming 
			manvantara-s, eras. Then on Vishnu is eulogised as Trivikrama, <em>tri 
			vi krama</em> three, verily, paced - surpassing, one who surpasses all 
			the three worlds in three strides.</p>
