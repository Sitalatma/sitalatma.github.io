<h3>chapter [Sarga] 38<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">ṃāreecha continues his good word to Ravana and he dissuades him from abducting Seetha. His advice is that the dalliance with other's
wives is the greatest sin, more so, with Rama's wife as Rama's valour is irrefutable. ṃāreecha narrates how Rama hurt him while safeguarding
Vishwamitra's Vedic-ritual, when Rama was still a young boy.</p>

beings. But the mythological entities do not have them. As a young scholar, the boys are supposed to wear simply, hence 'one-piece-clothing' is said
to be the dress of Rama. This suggests that he is not wearing any shield or armour to keep him safe. In Bala Kanda, at the outset of the journey of
Rama and Lakshmana with Vishvamitra, it is said that they are wearing finger-covers made of certain lizard skin, which means to say that their
fingers are very tender in using arrows. His mothers delicately arranged the locks of hair, because he is still 'boyish' to her. ṃore so, he is with
a 'boyish' ornament, say a single pendant, not verily embellished with princely jewellery. He appeared like some providential 'boy' hitherto unseen,
with the height of a peacock, with the complexion of peacock-neck-blue, and moving about like a noble peacock. This boyish-Rama peacock is not
screaming, yet his bow is twanging; leave alone the screeching and screaming.</p>
<div id="btn4" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">Tṭhe 'new-moon' metaphor to Rama suggests that he has only waxing and no waning
in him, <em>uttarottara abhivṛiddhi</em> and also that he is by birth an antagonist of <em>tamas</em> 'the
darkness,' or darkish activities, like the moon whose activity is only to illumine the night.
Further, he has a likeable persona to any, even to the present demon ṃāreecha, and even to Ravana.
When Ravana sees Rama for the first time in war, Ravana praisefully acknowledges Rama's
personality. Besides, Rama's gleam is like that of a baby-moon, against the backdrop of a thickish,
darkish, blackish sky, called the forest.</p>
