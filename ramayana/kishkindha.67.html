<h3>chapter [Sarga] 67<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Hanuma comes forward to leap the ocean at the repeated encouragement given by Jambavanta. Then he increases his physique, fit enough
to take a leap, and starts declaring his capabilities, by which the other monkeys feel jubilant. Then Hanuma climbs ṃt. ṃahendra, by which whole of
that mountain is put to turmoil. And he reaches Lanka, instinctually, as he has the speed of Air-god and of the Thought Process, i.e., <font color=
"#B3003A">mano javam, māruta tulya vegam...</font> Thus, with this chapter this book of Kishkindha Kanda, 'The Empire of Holy ṃonkeys...'
concludes.</p>

<p class="Itrṣloka">Why give credit to Hanuma's flight?</p>
<div id="btn17" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">It may look oddish
in narrating this chapter, only to eulogise the effort of Hanuma in taking a flight over the ocean,
when the oldish-girlish-hottish Shurpanakha is easily taking flights across ocean with or without
visa. Or even that stooge of Ravana, namely Akampana, who rushes to Ravana to carry the news of
annihilation of Khara, Dushana and others, and he even comes to Ravana before Shurpanakha crossing
ocean without difficulty. However, Ravana is the lone one who uses a chariot-like aircraft that
brays like a supersonic jet. In such a case an objection is raised in questioning - 'are they not
speedier than Hanuma? ' It is not so, it is said, the effort and preparation of Hanuma are on the
level of earthly beings, whereas the artifice of Ravana with tricks and trickery, with more tricky
and technical aircrafts of demons, is an infra-mundane action, if not witchery and wizardry. No
doubt, Ravana's machines and vehicles are the derivatives of Atharvana Veda, but they are all
counterproductive, revulsive, and phobic to the wellbeing of society. Uncongenial to atmosphere and
thus unwelcome stratagems. And here it is said by Hanuma, one to too many times 'I will do it by
the speed of my arms, thighs and calves...' etc., which itself is reflective of his innate,
inherent, personal traits, talents, and capabilities, than more technical or contrived
paraphernalia of the demons. Hence, Hanuma is identified as a self-assured, self-active,
self-propelling dedicatee to duty, and his flight is on a separate footing.</font></p>
