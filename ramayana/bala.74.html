 Parashu Rama confronts the wedding party that is returning to Ayodhya from

  <p class="comment">
 It is customary to follow the wedding party up to the outskirts of village or
  town. In the meantime, there will be two or three hugs of mother and the bride, shedding two or
  three litres of tears, while the father of the bride secretly wipes his own moist eyes, and the
  like. Because, this despatch of the bride is considered as another life to her, for she cannot
  come to her father's house as and when she wants. Even if she comes, she has&nbsp; to return to 
	her husband&#39;s place at some point of time, because from now onward 'that' house has become 'her'
  house. In this particular case of Seetha, she does not come to ṃithila after this episode and
  even when Rama abandons her she goes into the womb of her mother, ṃother Earth, but not to
  ṃithila. So let us leave Janaka and his queen as they have the satisfaction in marrying their
  daughter, whose marriage itself is problematical so far, and when that has happened, now some
  sort of dissatisfaction has cropped up, in leaving her off with some forest ranger, called
  Rama.</p>

 "Will he eradicate the race of Kshatriya-s even now as he was once envenomed by
  the murder of his father, or what... abated is his anger and alleviated is his frenzy previously
  when he eliminated Kshatriya-s... but is he really intending to eliminate Kshatriya-s once again,
  or what?" Thus, those Brahmans talked among themselves. [1-74-21b, 22]</p>

  <p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">This Parashu Rama
  or Bhārgava Rama is believed as the sixth incarnation of Vishnu on earth, prior to Dasharatha
  Rama. The word <font color="#B3003A">parashu</font> 'an axe...' is prefixed to this Rama because
  he wields a merciless axe. His father was sage Jamadagni and mother Renuka. This Jamadagni is the
  son of Sage Ricīka, a Brahman, and he married Satyavati, the sister of Vishvamitra, a Kshatriya.
  On certain occasion Jamadagni doubting his wife Renuka's infidelity orders this Parashu Rama to
  behead her, which he promptly does, but Bhārgava Rama requests his father to bring her back to
  life. Sage Jamadagni agrees and brings her back to life. This is a kind of entrance test to
  Parashu Rama, and if he can ruthlessly kill his own mother he does not hesitate to kill any, in
  future.</font></p>

  <p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" class="comment">During their
  time, the kings were cruel and homicide was rampant to achieve the desires of the throne, however
  ruthless it might be. On another occasion when the sons of one Kārtvīryārjuna sacrifice Sage
  Jamadagni as a sacrificial human, this Parashu Rama is frenziedly infuriated and starts
  eliminating all of the enthroned Kshatriya bloodlines on earth. That way he roves over the earth
  for thirty seven times eliminating Kshatriya-s. He even cuts off the foetuses in wombs of their
  queens, in order to stop the menacing progeny and offers the blood of the foetus as oblation. And
  that blood became five streams called <font color="#B3003A">shamanta pancaka</font>. Bhārgava or
  Parashu Rama practises insurmountable ascesis and appeases God Shiva, and thus acquires divine
  weaponry. He is indomitable in archery and nothing is unknown to him in the art of archery. Yet,
  he resorts to an axe to behead cruel kings, physically and personally, without depending up on a
  distant shooting arrow. He is <font color="#B3003A">ciranjīvi</font> 'long living being...'
  Later when peace is established on earth, this Parashu Rama retires to penance but re-entered
  here to have a glimpse of Dasharatha Rama. And the purpose and import of his entry at this place,
  is recorded in later chapters.</font></p>
