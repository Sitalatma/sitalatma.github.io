			The three-way coursing of the river is firstly as Ganga in the lap of 
			Himalayas. Then when she cruised heavenward with divinities as Deva 
			Ganga, or ṃandākini or Sudīrghika, it is second. Later, when she came 
			to earth from heaven and gone into ocean and even to netherworlds as 
			Jahnavi, it is the third. There are variations for this. Some say that 
			the river&#39;s entry into sky is the first, by taking words <em>gati matām 
			vara, gati</em> and deriving meaning as - which sky grants a path for 
			all moving things etc., and the next is her entry to heaven, and nextly 
			her coming to earth. And some say that gods have not left her in middle 
			of the sky to come to heaven at a later time, and hence her three courses 
			are as Ganga, ṃandākini, and Jahnavi.</p>
