<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			On enquiring details about those dangerous demons that are ravaging sage&#39;s ritual, 
			King Dasharatha refuses to send young Rama along with Sage Vishvamitra on many 
			an account, and thus confronts the Sage&#39;s wrath.</p>

			<p class="pratipada">
			<em>1. rāja shārdūlaḥ</em> = king, the tiger; <em>vishvamitrasya tat bhāṣitam 
			shrutvā</em> = Vishvamitra&#39;s, that, spoken, on hearing; <em>muhūrtam iva nissanjñaḥ</em> 
			= for a time, thus, became senseless; <em>sanjñavān idam abravīt</em> = gaining 
			senses, this, said.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			On hearing what is spoken by Vishvamitra the tigerly-king Dasharatha became insensate 
			for a time, and on redeeming senses he said this. [1-20-1]</p>

			ūna ṣoḍaśa varṣo me rāmo rājīva locanaḥ |<br>
			na yuddha yogyatām asya paśyāmi saha rākṣasaiḥ || 1-20-2</p>

			<p class="pratipada">
			<em>2. rājīva lochanaḥ</em> = lotus, eyed one; <em>me rāmaḥ</em> = my, Rama;
			<em>ūna ṣoDasha varṣaḥ</em> = is less than, sixteen, years [of age]; <em>asya 
			rākshasaiḥ saha</em> = his, with, demons; <em>yuddha yogyatām</em> = warring, 
			aptitude; <em>na pasyāmi</em> = not, I see.</p>

			<p class="tat">
			&quot;&quot;Less than sixteen years of age is my lotus-eyed Rama, and I see no warring aptitude 
			to him with the demons. [1-20-2]</p>

			<p class="comment">
			This particular statement <em>ūna SoDasha varshaḥ</em> less than sixteen years, 
			has evoked a spate of commentaries in deciding the age of Rama at this juncture 
			of going along with Sage Viswamitra, i.e., at the time of his marrying Seeta and 
			at the time of his exile to forests etc. His age is said to be twelve years as 
			of now. And this is confirmed by ṃareecha while advising Ravana, that &#39;as a boy 
			of twelve Rama, killed my mother and brother, and hit me out&#39; as at 3-38-6,
			<em>ūna dvādasha varṣaḥ</em> Or, <em>bālo dvādasha varṣo ayam</em> as per 
			other versions of the same verse.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Ramayana has some bearing on the number twelve. The Books or Kānda-s are 6, half 
			of twelve. The total verses are 24 thousand, two folds of twelve thousand. Rama 
			is born in twelfth month. Vishvamitra&#39;s arrival, or better said as <em>Seetha 
			kalyaṇa</em> , Seetha&#39;s marriage with Rama, is in the twelfth year. His stay in 
			Ayodhya before crown prince ceremony and exile is for twelve years. The years 
			of Rama&#39;s exile are twelve, plus two years stay in Panchavati, of the total fourteen 
			years of exile. In Uttara Ramayana Seetha&#39;s exile in the hermitage of Valmiki 
			is for twelve years. So on...</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Some others said that because Rama has not yet attained all the sixteen phases 
			like full moon, he is not a full-fledged person, <em>chāru SoDasha kalā sahitaḥ</em> 
			Again in saying: <em>rājīva lochana</em> lotus-eyed one - petals of lotuses 
			close down by night, so Rama&#39;s eyelids too close by night for a boyish sleep. 
			Then how can such a boy war with night-active demons? In answer to this Sage Vishvamitra 
			uses the same wording in previous chapter at 1-19-18, <em>dasha rātram; rāmam 
			rājīva locanam</em> where the wording <em>rājīva locana</em> is used by Vishvamitra 
			in the sense that the petals of a lotus spread out on the first rays of sun. So 
			also the very opening of the lotus-petal eyelids of Rama will eradicate the nightly 
			menace of demons with his Omniscient Sun-ṃoon-Fire eyes, <em>sūrya chandra agni 
			lochana</em> , that can see even in night.</p>

			<p class="comment">
			A Kshatriya of sixteen years age is unfit to war with any one, as he is still 
			a childhood <em>bāla āshoDashāt varṣā</em> . But Rama is under sixteen, and 
			he is being requisitioned for war. Can he combat even if he is under aged? Yes, 
			he can, says Govindaraja as per the <em>nyaya</em> /syndrome, <em>tejasām hi 
			na vayaḥ samīkshyate</em> &#39;dextrous person&#39;s age is not to be reckoned&#39; As such, 
			though Rama appears to be under aged he can do wonders in eliminating the vice. 
			This is again rounded off with Vishvamitra&#39;s wording in last chapter: <em>aham 
			vedmi mahā ātmānam rāmam rājīva locanam</em>.</p>
