<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 65<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Kumbhakarna rebukes Mahodara for rendering a wrong advice to Ravana. He asserts Ravana, saying that he will annihilate Rama in battle.
Ravana gets pleased and orders Kumbhakarna to wipe off the monkeys together with Rama and Lakshmana in battle. Then, Ravana arranged for
ornamentation of the various limbs of Kumbhakarna with various types of jewellery, before sending him to the battle. As Kumbhakarna sallies forth to
the battle, several bad omens appear on all sides. Kumbhakarna disregards these portents and marches ahead for the battle. Seeing the colossal form
of Kumbhakarna, all the monkeys get frightened and take to their heels.</p>
