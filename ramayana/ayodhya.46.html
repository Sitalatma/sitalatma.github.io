<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Having reached the banks of Tamasa river and thinking of the plight of the people of Ayodhya, Rama passes the night on the banks of
Tamasa river. Waking up in the meantime, Rama instructs the charioteer to drive the chariot in such a way as to elude the citizens and lead them to
think that the chariot had turned back towards Ayodhya instead of proceeding towards the forest. He then ascends the chariot along with Sita and
Lakshmana and went ahead to the forest.</p>

without self-centeredness knows what love is. Then the seemingly untruth is not untruth, the hurt in appearance is not really a hurt and the said
deception is not a deception. Rama the knower of love was free to do what was right and whatever he did was righteous.</p>
