Lady Tara rushes out to reach her slain husband while the monkey generals seek of her to anoint Angada 
as king immediately or leave Kishkindha, for Sugreeva and his men may come occupying the city. She chides 
their advises away and proceeds to meet Vali. She arrives at that place, sees Rama and his brother Lakshmana, 
her husband Vali and his brother Sugreeva. She faints and wails for the departing soul of Vali.</p>

<p class="comment">

<p class="comment">
There is a grammarian&#39;s problem in this verse. The word <em>chet</em> usually used for &#39; if...&#39; Then 
the meaning obtained is &quot;If a brother is felled by his brother for the sake of kingdom, what if and 
why do you fear?&quot; Then this may not justify Tara&#39;s decency. And if this <em>cet</em> is taken as <em>
prashnārthaka</em> &#39;interrogative...&#39; then it may mean that she is trying to ascertain whether Vali 
is dead or still alive, to have a last glimpse. And enquiring in anguish would be normal in such situations. 
It may be correct to use &#39;whether&#39; because it ensues &#39;not&#39; and also as an alternative interrogative. 
And &#39;if&#39; is used it is &#39;if of ignorance&#39; but not &#39;of certainty&#39; or &#39;of chance&#39;. Anyway she is interested 
in information and orderliness of monkeys.</p>

<strong>Sloka 10</strong></p>

<p class="comment">
The plural number given to the &#39;arrows&#39; may be observed. Rama shot Vali with only one arrow but each 
monkey is multiplying one arrow to become many. Rumours multiply thus.</p>

<p class="comment">
Even in capital many followed the suite of Vali in incarcerating other&#39;s wives. Now they all may turn 
up since Sugreeva won the battle, assaulting such followers of Vali&#39;s style of living. This is the fear 
of individuals reported to Tara.</p>

The word <em>apla antara</em> is usually &#39;a little after...&#39; But Prof. Satya Vrat includes this under 
rare words/expressions of Ramayana and gives meaning as &#39;small distance...&#39; In any way a pause occurs 
now for her to reply. She is going towards the place where Vali is and monkeys are following her. She 
paced still ahead, gained a pause and then started to speak to them.</p>

<p class="comment">
Some commentators negate this simile of tiger to Rama, saying it <em>abhūta upama</em> &#39;impossible 
smile...&#39; By virtue Rama himself is the lion-king and comparing him with a lesser animal like tiger 
is objected, though Rama did not eliminate Vali for flesh or meat. The word <em>shārdūla</em> textually 
means a tiger in the present day context. For this commentators bring in the rulebook <em>vyjayanti</em> 
which says <em>shārdūla</em> also means a lion <em>-si~Nho mṛiga indraḥ pañcāsyo haryakṣhaḥ shveta 
pi~Ngalaḥ vyādīrnāsyo mahānādaḥ shārdūlo amita vikrama</em></p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>chaitya</em> is not to be confounded with Buddhist monastery. In villages, even today, 
people will prepare a makeshift sanctum adorning it with a podium and flags for worships, and that being 
an open place snakes sneak in, for which eagles will come and sit on the flagstaff, and when catching 
its prey that eagle kicks off the flag post, and by the fall of that flagstaff that makeshift sanctum 
gets plumped onto ground.</p>

This verse reminds us of the results from brotherly love-hate, younger-elder brother relation. Lakshmana
