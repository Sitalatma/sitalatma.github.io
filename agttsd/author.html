<p>
Śrī&shy;la Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami was born on October 23, 1948. In February 1971 he joined ISKCON, and in July he became an initiated disciple of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhak&shy;ti&shy;ve&shy;dan&shy;ta Swami Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da. During the years that followed, he became Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's personal servant and secretary, traveling with him in India and around the world.

<p>
The year 1976, however, marked a significant turning-point in Śrī&shy;la Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami's devotional career - Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da ordered him to print his books in all the languages of the world and to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the European and Soviet communist countries.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp1157" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
That same year Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami was awarded <em>san&shy;nyā&shy;sa</em> and immediately left for Europe to carry out the instructions of his spiritual master. In December he was appointed GBC and BBT Trustee for Eastern Europe and Germany; and in March 1977, GBC for Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia. Shortly thereafter, Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da ordered him, along with ten other senior disciples, to accept the duties of an initiating <em>guru</em>.

<p>
One of the most important missions that Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da left to his disciples is the development of Maya&shy;pur City. From the early days of the Puṣ&shy;pa-sa&shy;mā&shy;dhi Project, Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami has worked to actualize Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's far-reaching vision of a wonderful temple and city in Maya&shy;pur. And his most recent contribution is a state-of-the-art multimedia presentation of ISKCON that will help raise funds for the Maya&shy;pur Project.

<p>
Over the years, a distinguishing feature of Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami's mood of service to Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da has been the focused understanding that book production and book distribution are the heart and soul of the <em>saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. Because of his single-minded enthusiasm and dedication in this regard, the North European BBT has steadily increased its productivity and now prints approximately 10 million pieces of transcendental literature in forty languages every year.

<p>
Aside from his other engagements, Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami is also writing books. The <em>Varṇāśrama Manifesto for Social Sanity</em> deals with the Ve&shy;dic concept of social organization. His <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em> lectures in Śrī&shy;dhā&shy;ma Maya&shy;pur have been published in a book entitled <em>The Thirteenth Chapter</em>, and a series of books elaborating on the other chapters of the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā As It </em>Is will be published in the years to come.

<p>
On yet another preaching front, Ha&shy;ri&shy;ke&shy;śa Swami has been reaching out to younger generations through his music since the late 1970s. His group RA&shy;SA came out with nine LPs, and from the mid-1980s, his group BLISS has produced another ten tapes and CDs. From 1990 to 1992 he organized grand tours of the GAUR&shy;ANGA BHA&shy;JAN BAND, which was known for its impressive stage acts. At this band's concerts, thousands of people, especially in Eastern Europe, chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> and danced in ecstasy. His latest success has been the best-selling techno CD <em>Rising Sign</em> by SRI HARI. Through this direct, appealing and modern medium, millions of people have heard the transcendental message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
