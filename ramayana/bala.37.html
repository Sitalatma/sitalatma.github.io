			Skanda / Kārtikeya made his one face into six and sucked all the milk 
			of all the six stars and become an adolescent boy in day. Hence he looked 
			like the one with six faces, by which he is called <em>Shan mukha</em> 
			, six-faced deity. Later he argues with his father Shiva that he is 
			superior to Shiva, because he has five-faces of Shiva, plus his own, 
			totalling to a six, and he is a six-faced deity, superior to the five-faced 
			god, namely Shiva. In another way, the boy by birth is dextrous and 
			he sucked the milk of all the six mothers in split second with one face, 
			but it appeared to all deities that the boy has been sucking milk with 
			six faces, i.e., with rapid-face-movement. Thus on establishing his 
			ambidextrous personality, the gods nominate him as the chief of Celestial 
			Army.</p>
