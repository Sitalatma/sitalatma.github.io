<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful ṃajesties</h3>
<h3>[Sarga] 32<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Sept 09</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			Sage Vishvamitra starts to narrate Kusha&#39;s legend. Vishvamitra is the 
			offspring of Kusha&#39;s dynasty. Brahma gives boon to Kusha to beget four 
			sons and one among them is Kushanābha. Kushanaba begets a hundred daughters 
			of excellent beauty. When Vayu, Air-god cherishes them all, those girls 
			refuse him, as they prefer an arranged marriage by their father. Then 
			Air-god in his indignation disfigures them all.</p>
