<h3>chapter [Sarga] 18<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8 - Sep 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

			<p class="txt">
			After the completion of Vedic ritual all the kings and Sage Rishyasringa took 
			leave of Dasharatha and went away to their countries. After some time Rama, Lakshmana, 
			Bharata, and Shatrughna are born. Their virtues in childhood and rituals connected 
			thereto are depicted here. Dasharatha then contemplates the marriages of the princes, 
			since marrying sons after completion of education is customary. At that juncture 
			Sage Vishvamitra arrives at the court of Dasharatha seeking help from the king. 
			Dasharatha receives him adoring in high esteem.</p>

<p class="tat">
Twice six months had rolled a way since the great sacrifice was over and, in the first month 
of the New Year, on the ninth day of the bright fortnight, the Lord of the worlds chose to 
take human form and sent down half of His essence as the son of Kausalya (thenceforth to be 
known as Rama), the world-honored One, the crowning glory ot the grand line of Ikshwku, and 
the sum of all perfections. The constellation Punarvasu, of which Aditi was the regent, was 
chosen to preside at his birth. The Sun, ṃars, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn were in ascension 
in their respective houses. Aries, Capricornus, Cancer, Pisces and the Libra, Jupiter and 
the ṃoon were in conjunction ; the rising sign was Cancer. And KausalyA, shone with unparalleled 
effulgence, even as Aditi when she gave birth to Indra, the lord of the Shining Ones, the 
Vajra-wielder. - C. R. Sreeniuasa Aiyangar, 1910.</p>

The phrase <em>viṣṇoḥ artham</em> half of Vishnu - is to be taken as
<em>half of the fruit of ritual</em> where Vedic ritual itself is pervaded 
by Vishnu. The fruit of ritual is obtained in the shape of dessert, and Kausalya consumed 
half of it, but it is not half of Vishnu as he is illimitable. Even Sreeniuasa Aiyangar took 
it as half, in saying half of Vishnu&#39;s essence is Rama. This has become a perennial topic debating whether 
the incarnation of Rama is a <em>pUrṇa avtAra</em>, <em>artha avatAra</em> or <em>aṃsha avatAra</em>.</p>
