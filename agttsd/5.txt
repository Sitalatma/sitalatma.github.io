title=The Qualities of a Saṅkīrtana Devotee

sub=A Well-rounded Person

It is difficult for me to say what the most important quality is for a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee to possess, because no one quality is more important than another. A <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee must be a well-rounded person. For example, he must tolerate all kinds of changing conditions: Sometimes it is cold and sometimes it is hot, sometimes people are friendly and sometimes they are nasty, and sometimes he is living in the back of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van and sometimes in some grungy hotel. He is so tolerant because he sees how the people are suffering, and he wants to help them. Thus he is also merciful and kind. Despite disturbing obstacles, he stays out on the street and continues to give Śrīla Prabhupāda's books to the people. To go on like this for a lifetime requires determination, especially if he doesn't do so well. Sometimes a devotee does well in the beginning but later has difficulty accomplishing the same results, and he has to show his determination to please Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master.

He must be dedicated and devoted to the spiritual master because he is distributing books on the spiritual master's order. That order comes from Śrīla Prabhupāda, the Founder-Acārya of our ISKCON society. Prabhupāda has given that order throughout the history of ISKCON, and it applies for all history to come. Therefore the disciple must have a very great love for the spiritual master and his order. He accepts the order of the spiritual master and fulfills that order with his heart and soul. Śrīla Prabhupāda often quoted Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravarti Ṭhākura's commentary on the verse <em>vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana</em>, which says that the disciple must make the desire of the spiritual master his desire. The spiritual master desires to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness and distribute as many books as possible throughout the world, and we have to make this desire our desire because we have so many desires that do not have much to do with the preaching mission. This is natural for the conditioned soul. Therefore a serious devotee engages in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and becomes very happy.

A <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee must be nonenvious because now and then others will defeat him in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> competition. When this happens, he should be pleased that the other devotees are doing so nicely in their devotional service, and he should aspire to follow in their footsteps. He should not think, "I should have done what they did. I'm also very great. Why is everyone applauding them?” This is envy manifesting. Thus a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee must be satisfied with whatever comes of its own accord. For example, <em>prasādam</em> in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van is not very opulent. One cooks on a one-burner stove with a pressure cooker, making <em>kicharī</em> with breadsticks in different varieties, sometimes with more potatoes, sometimes with fewer potatoes. One has to be satisfied with this simple meal.

Thus austerity is required. To always carry around a lot of books is a much harder austerity than to meditate in the forest and perform mystic <em>yoga</em>. The austerity of the <em>yogīs</em> is to sit in a freezing cold river on a freezing cold winter's day and simply experience the coldness. This is a great austerity, and we doubt that we could do it. But we also doubt that the <em>yogīs</em> could stand on a modern city street with a pile of books on their arm, handing them out to the people who come by. Now, of the two forms of austerity, which is more important and relevant to the preaching mission? The <em>yogī</em>, following the path of mystic austerity —sitting alone in the forest and enjoying the fruits of his austerities—may benefit himself, but he is not benefiting anyone else. On the other hand, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is one-hundred-percent dedicated to serving and helping other people, which makes his austerity much more important and valuable than the austerity a mystic <em>yogi</em> performs.

One could list so many other qualities that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and ladies possess. Still, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are sometimes criticized by foolish persons who think that something is wrong with single-mindedly doing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> all the time, that one doesn't become learned or devotionally qualified. That is foolish, because you will find all the best qualities in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. To keep the van clean is a cleaning project like cleaning the temple. Cooking little feasts on their one-burner is also an art. They are serving the Vaiṣṇavas. And they have learned the most important art of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious and distributing that Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others. What more do you want? Everything is there. Therefore to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is the most glorious position within this Kṛṣṇa consciousness mission.

sub=Beaming with Transcendental Consciousness

One who knows <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> and distributes it to others is the most magnanimous of souls because he is distributing the glorious words of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, who presented this transcendental knowledge under the order of Śrī Nārada Muni. And now Śrīla Prabhupāda is bringing this knowledge under the order of the previous <em>ācāryas</em> to all the conditioned souls within this world. These books with their transcendental purports are designed to awaken realization of the Absolute Truth within the hearts of the conditioned souls. Therefore the devotees wander from town to town and village to village just to deliver this transcendental knowledge.

Through these transcendental books the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will ultimately conquer all other philosophies and forms of religiosity on this planet. Who else has knowledge that can compare to the knowledge in these books? The Bible, for instance, gives some knowledge of the Supreme, but it is a short book, containing mainly analogies, allegories, stories, and histories. It contains very little information of the qualities, activities, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

To know about Kṛṣṇa you have to go to authorities like Nārada Muni and Aṅgirā Ṛṣi, and they will grant you this knowledge. That is why we distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Here we have an authority granting us transcendental knowledge. They are not just any books. It is not that we like to sell books. If I gave you a set of encyclopedias to sell, you probably wouldn't be able to do it, because you are not interested in them. Even though you might make some money by selling them, you know that such books are available everywhere, they have no value, and you become a fool and a rascal by reading them, not a learned scholar. Therefore we are only interested in distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. His books have the potency to incite a revolution in the hearts of men. A sudden change in fortune is within their grasp. They have the possibility to awaken to their real position as servants of the Lord and become blissful. This is not possible by distributing any other kind of book. Śrīla Prabhupāda wants us to distribute these books because he knows the people have no other source of transcendental knowledge. If they want it, they have to get it from us.

The problem is they don't even want it, so we follow in the footsteps of the saintly personalities and try to inspire the conditioned souls to want something they don't want. It is amazing that you can give a book to a person who doesn't want it. The mundane salesmen can study our technique all day and night, and they will not be able to duplicate it. Many times a day, every day of the year, week after week, thousands of books are given to people who don't want them, because when a person beaming with transcendental consciousness is standing before them, they become attracted and impressed. The devotee is unlike the ordinary people of this world. He is not asking much: “Just take one, two, or twenty of these books home.” After all, people buy so much garbage while they are shopping. Half of the time they don't know what they are buying. But when they take home these books, they become transcendentally blissful. The distributors often send us photos of people who have bought sets of books, blissfully holding the books with big smiles on their faces.

During the Prabhupāda Marathon, every one of us can give others the opportunity to experience that happiness. It is nice that the Christians have this Christmas holiday. The people are a little loose with their <em>lakṣmī</em>, and when they meet a devotee they become enlivened. A devotee approaches them with confidence because he knows he has something they really want. Superficially they may not want it, but deep down they do because they want to be happy, and this is the way to be happy. Therefore they surrender and take the book home. And when they read the books, their whole life changes. They write us letters, saying, “I've read all these books, and now I can no longer live within the material world. What shall I do?" We say, “Wonderful!" Another book has bombed this person's material life to smithereens. Another bomb has blasted the material existence of another materialist into tiny pieces, and now he has become a spiritualist.

sub=Material Qualifications Are Not Enough

Those on the middle-class platform, <em>madhya</em>ma-adhikārī, can engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement because <em>saṅkīrtana</em> means preaching to the innocent. Those on the third-class platform, <em>kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</em>, cannot engage in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> because they lack the faith to do it. You have to have faith to engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. It cannot be done by material means alone. Even if you were an expert distributor of encyclopedias before you came to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you wouldn't be able to distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books on that basis alone. We once hired an expert book salesman to sell our books in the bookstores. “No problem," he said. “I can easily sell these books. They are very nice.” But he couldn't sell a single book. He had to come back shamefaced and admit, “I cannot sell these books. Nobody wants them. How do you do it?" Our devotees do it by having faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Even new <em>bhaktas</em> can distribute hundreds of books a week and leave the greatest salesmen in the dust. Not many people would believe how many books we sell each week, and we don't even tell them, because they would just get bewildered.

The fallen conditioned souls are blessed by this wonderful book distribution mission even though they are averse to Kṛṣṇa.

quote=icchā-dveṣa-samutthena<br />&emsp;dvandva-mohena bhārata<br />sarva-bhūtāni sammohaṁ<br />&emsp;sarge yānti paran-tapa

It is heavy to think about, but we are approaching haters of Kṛṣṇa, who don't want to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotee has to convince them that something is wrong with being a hater of Kṛṣṇa. If he nicely explains to them why they want these books, then the people become attracted to the devotee and the beauty of the books, and they take books without even realizing that this is exactly what they didn't want. Later on many of them realize this and ask themselves, "Why did I buy these books? I didn't even want them,” and when they meet the distributor on the street again, they tell him, “I didn't want these books, but somehow you made me buy them.” They bought them because their deepest, most heartfelt desire is to take many books and surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People surrender to the book distributors because a pure representative of the spiritual master is standing in front of them. They can see that he is more powerful, he has his mission, and his concentration is fixed on one point. Never underestimate the purity and determination needed by the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

sub=Only Devotees Can Sell These Books

No materialist can distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. A true story from Argentina illustrates this point. In 1976, a military coup overthrew Mrs. Perón's government and took control of Argentina. They tried to destroy the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because the Catholic Church was actually running the whole thing from behind the scenes, saying, “Get rid of these Hare Kṛṣṇas; they're too powerful.” Paramilitary forces fired machine gun bullets through the front of the temple as the devotees were paying obeisances before taking <em>prasādam</em>. They confiscated everything—books, pictures, and everyone's <em>japa</em> beads. The devotees had to flee with the Deities to Brazil. It was a terrible situation.

I was always trying to think of a way to get back the books the military government had stolen. For many years the books sat in a military warehouse. Then, in 1984, when the military government was deposed and a civilian government was elected into power, they opened the military warehouses and auctioned off the confiscated goods, and one professional bidder bought all our books with the intention of reselling them for a profit. The devotees were not aware of this and were convinced that our books had been burned long ago. Every time I asked them, they said, “There's no way they'd keep books for ten years; the books must be already long gone."

Two years later, the bidder happened to run into one of our book distributors on the street. When the man saw the <em>Bhagavad-gīt</em>ā, he said, “Oh, I also have many books with this funny writing. Would you be interested in them?” The devotee, being new and unaware of the situation, wondered what this man was talking about, so he went back to the temple and told Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami about it. As we know, Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami is really smart, so he went to the man and nonchalantly said, “Oh, I've heard you have something we might be interested in. Let's see what you have.” The man showed him <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavata</em>m, and Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami said, “Nobody cares about these books, and certainly nobody will buy them."

The man said, “Yeah, I know. I've been trying for two years to sell these books and nobody wants them. I haven't sold a single book in two years."

“Yes, nobody wants these books. What do you want me to do?”

"Can you use these books?” “Oh, maybe, I don't know.” "Please, take them."

For an insanely low price, Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami took back the books, and the devotees sold them in less than two weeks. The funny thing was, because the devotees' money had also been confiscated by the military, they never had to pay the bill for the printing. After ten years, they got the books back for almost nothing because this man couldn't sell one book. From this example we can understand that our books don't want to be sold by materialists. The books stay in their hands and say, “No, we won't go anywhere. There's no love and devotion here.” The distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is a completely spiritual activity that can only be done by devotees.

sub=Saṅkīrtana Identification

Sometimes the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are criticized for strongly identifying with their service. But I think this identification is good because it is so easy to stop being a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee and become a <em>gurukula</em> devotee, a kitchen devotee, a <em>pūjā</em> devotee, a farm devotee, or whatever, because these activities don't demand as much surrender and are not as taxing as going out, walking the streets, and meeting contaminated, inimical, and demoniac people on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> every day.

To come back to the temple and do some other service doesn't mean everything is going to be blissful, because the mind goes with you. The mind becomes agitated in the temple because there is less pure protection in the temple than in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> field. There are all kinds of agitations: somebody tries to push his opinion on you, to show you he is better than you, or to force you to do something you don't want to do. It is just plain old <em>māyā</em>. There are a lot of troubles in the temple; everything is not all peaches and cream. It is much better out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, where you will find the real protection, the real bliss, and the juice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

To identify yourself as a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is a lot better than to identify yourself as a <em>gṛhastha</em> or a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or a this or a that. We are all <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees in Lord Caitanya's eternal <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party, so there can be no fault with this identification. But, of course, if you become proud and think other devotees are something else, more lowly, then you fall down from the platform of purification and become contaminated. Proud devotees usually fall away from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and cannot do it for a long time.

But one who knows, “I'm a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, and I had better stay a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee," and who therefore prays, “Kṛṣṇa, please give me Your mercy so I can remain a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, and all you devotees, please bless me so that I can perform this service all my life”—then it is a good identification, because that makes one humble.

Being a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee means being a servant of all the people. It doesn't mean you are something great, glorious, and wonderful. Of course, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are glorified on the weekends. Someone will get all the roars and “rahhhs" from all the devotees. “Rahhh! You're the greatest! You're number one! Pound the drums! Pound the floor! This guy's the greatest!” Of course, five minutes later everyone forgets it. But, at the time, one is thinking himself the greatest. That is an identification which also destroys everything. You are not the greatest, you are not the smallest. You are just Kṛṣṇa's humble servant. You are supposed to go out and distribute the books and not get hung up on all these things. In a humble state of mind one can perform <em>saṅkīrtana</em> continuously. But as far as the identification itself, it is good to identify yourself as a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. It is better than any other identification. But ultimately we know we are just Kṛṣṇa's servants. We are nothing but the servants of the servants of the servants of the <em>gopīs</em>. Lord Caitanya taught us this, and He is the supreme <em>saṅkīrtana-ācārya</em>. So we should follow in His footsteps.

Anybody with a sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in his heart will glorify the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees, but it is the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees' responsibility to understand that all this glorification is for their service, not for them. If somebody says, "Oh, you're doing so wonderfully,” it is because you are doing a wonderful service. The service is glorious, and you just happen to be doing it. Therefore you are being glorified. Somebody else will do it if you don't, and then he will be glorified. These books are so wonderful that anything connected with them-reading them, distributing them, producing them—makes one glorious. It is the books' credit, not one's own credit.

sub=Transcendental Knowledge

In South Africa in 1975, we were in Śrīla Prabhupāda's room and he had just been given the Fifth Canto of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>. He was very happy to get this book. But as he was looking at the book, and as everybody left, he said, “In America they are thinking these books are for others, that they are simply for distribution. They don't know that I have written these books for my disciples to read. Now I am authorizing you to read my books twenty-four hours a day. I want all my disciples to become expert in this philosophy and then distribute it with great power and potency.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted his disciples to distribute millions of books, but he wanted them to do it for their whole lives, not like a comet streaking through the air—running around without really understanding what is going on. One cannot distribute books thinking of big results alone. One can do that for some time. We have personally seen that the motive to be on top of the charts is inspiring, but it doesn't last. One must have transcendental knowledge, <em>vidyā</em>. If it is done for fruitive results, the results will gradually diminish. Or we may maintain big results, but our idea will be, "I can also get big results in the material world. Why do I need Kṛṣṇa consciousness?” Therefore we have been losing some devotees throughout the years. Prabhupāda told us not to be attached to mundane fame, profit, or distinction. What difference does it make if nobody knows what you do, or nobody cares? The spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa know. We may somehow or other distribute by a material arrangement, but that will ultimately go down, down, down, and we will lose so many men. In 1970, when there were 450 devotees in this movement, Prabhupāda announced that we now had enough men and we should teach them to become first-class Vaiṣṇavas. “First class" means

quote=titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ<br />&emsp;suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām<br />ajāta-śatravaḥ śāntāḥ<br />&emsp;sādhavaḥ sādhu-bhūṣaṇāḥ

"The symptoms of a devotee are that he is tolerant, merciful, and friendly to all. He is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.”

sub=Absolute Determination

Our mission is to simply distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And the best way to do that we already know. We produce and distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books by the millions and billions and trillions, by the tons and billions of tons, until every house has a set and a reserve set. This is our mission. Plenty of people can buy a set, a spare set, and a reserve set for the future time capsule. We should be so fanatical. It is required. And that is renunciation.

Distributing books is the supreme renunciation. One doesn't sit in a nice temple, but one mainly lives in a van, sleeping and eating there too. It is a greater renunciation than a mystic <em>yogi</em> performs in the Himalayas because on the street <em>māyā</em> stares you in the eyes and says, “What, are you crazy?" And the devotee has to stare back at <em>māyā</em> and say, “No! Who's crazy—the one thinking he's the body or the one knowing he's a spirit soul?"

Upon accepting this mission of the Lord, one immediately and automatically renounces all other desires. Simply by being engaged in distributing books or supporting the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, there is no question of maintaining material desires. Who could avoid becoming renounced when engaged in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission? Only the greatest rascal insists on trying to be the enjoyer. Although he is thrown into an ocean of nectar, he crawls out again because he has a hog mentality and doesn't like nectar.

Until one has developed a taste, to simply be in the nectar of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is very difficult. But even if you don't have the taste, the qualification for developing it is to just keep on going. Better yet is to have some brain in the head and understand that in Kali-yuga, <em>yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</em>, Lord Caitanya's <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is the way to worship Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then you will engage in this mission with full, absolute determination.

sub=Devotees Are Kind

Although the materialists are far removed from Kṛṣṇa, they can be brought closer to Him by the kindness of a devotee. Devotees are so kind that they go out in the cold weather and distribute Kṛṣṇa conscious books. The people may not want any books, but they are able to take them, because the devotee's compassionate desire is stronger than their desire. Then, when they take a book and associate with this literature, they are purified and gradually realize more and more about Kṛṣṇa, and they eventually go back home, back to Godhead. If all you kind devotees keep bringing the Lord's mercy to the conditioned souls, everybody in the universe will be satisfied, including the demigods. The demigods are also devotees, and they like to see Lord Caitanya's followers bringing Kṛṣṇa consciousness to every door. If you just go on preaching, then you will realize Kṛṣṇa one day. Kṛṣṇa will simply say, “I am like this," and your life will be perfect.

sub=The Flame of Compassion

A person too much absorbed in himself loses his compassion for others. He doesn't consider book distribution to be very important, or he thinks, “Let others do it.” Such a person will only engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission out of force. You have to put a sword to his back and say, “March!” and then maybe he will do something out of fear. To do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, one has to be devoid of self-interest and only interested in helping others.

In spiritual life, as soon as you discipline yourself and do something you don't want to do, you will immediately like it. Sometimes I see so much fear of going out on book distribution among the ladies. This is mental-platform nonsense. As soon as you do it you will feel fine. As soon as you dive in and splash around in the nectar ocean of Lord Nityānanda's mercy, you will find that you feel good about it. You begin to wake up, you are enlivened, and your vision becomes clear. But for this to be possible, one has to have at least a little flame of compassion for the fallen conditioned souls suffering in this material world. Even if this flame is small, by fanning it, it will gradually grow into a big flame. And when that fire of desire is always burning hotter to serve this mission of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda under the instruction of the spiritual master, it will make a wonderful effect.

If you want to help others, then distribute books. And if you have no compassion to help others, then do it to help yourself get some compassion, because you cannot be a devotee of the Lord without compassion.

sub=The Dog of a Vaiṣṇava

A devotee sees himself as the dog of a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore we wear these beads around our necks. They are our dog collar. They show that we're ready to give the Vaiṣṇava whatever he wants. We're ready to surrender to his every desire and perform whatever service he asks. And sometimes his request is big, as is Śrīla Prabhupāda's request that we spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world by distributing his books far and wide. This is a very big service. The world is big and there are only a few of us. But, by distributing these books, we are expanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness more effectively than we ever could by speaking to people at their doors. We are expanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness in towns and villages where we would not have been accepted in other ways. People accept books because books look innocent.

sub=The Meaning of Surrender

We have to increase more and more. Every devotee can do it. One who presently sells five hundred books a week can easily increase to eight hundred. But increase doesn't mean pushing more or being more materially intelligent; it means to completely surrender to Kṛṣṇa, holding on to the lotus feet of the Lord at every moment and remembering that if we don't surrender now, we may not be able to do it in the future. Therefore we should immediately surrender all desires and aspirations for anything other than book distribution. Increase doesn't only mean pushing more or being more materially intelligent, don't misunderstand; it means being increasingly conscious of Kṛṣṇa at every moment, completely connected with the energy of the Lord. Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna, <em>nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin</em>: “Don't worry. By following My instructions, you will become connected with Me as an instrument to annihilate all these men.”

We have seen that those not surrendering to the book distribution mission fall away, whereas those who surrender become stronger. This is proof—<em>phalena paricīyate</em>, judging the relative value by the results—that we must become completely convinced that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that sense gratification is only worthy of hogs and dogs. All sense gratification culminates in sex life. According to the degree one is attracted to sex life, one cannot hold on to the lotus feet of the Lord.

It is a question of our desire to become Kṛṣṇa conscious; when we understand the urgency of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything else becomes insignificant. As soon as we become Kṛṣṇa conscious and surrender to the order of the Lord, He gives us the potency: <em>kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana</em>. “By Kṛṣṇa's <em>śakti</em>, the energy of the Lord, one can spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.” It cannot be done by mundane abilities, by a big show, or by tricks; it can only be done by sincere, one-hundred-percent surrender. Surrender means surrender unto the instruction of the guru, and Śrīla Prabhupāda has ordered book distribution to double this year.

As the material world goes to hell and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement takes hold, we will be the only shelter for the conditioned souls, and the whole world will surrender. Those who have tried to stop us will look back and appreciate the glories of the devotees who kept on distributing books despite all attempts to prevent them. Therefore the most glorious devotees surrender one hundred percent to selling Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. The more one increases, the more the mercy of the spiritual master comes pouring down on one's head. You don't have to believe me—just try it and see. Surrender completely to Kṛṣṇa! Otherwise you can surrender completely to <em>māyā</em>. We are perfectly capable of complete surrender, so why not surrender to Kṛṣṇa and become completely ecstatic? Just give up all dog-eating desires!

sub=Consistency

One should be consistent and not go up and down on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> chart. Many <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have performed their service steadily for many years and are always around the same number on the chart. When the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> results are read in the assembly of devotees, everyone doesn't jump up and down and scream their glories. But they are not concerned, because they know how much Śrīla Prabhupāda appreciates their consistent service. Consistency (maintenance of one's position) is a symptom of the mode of goodness, going up (creation) is a symptom of the mode of passion, and falling down (destruction) is a symptom of the mode of ignorance. That doesn't mean if you get a house and maintain a family for the rest of your life, you are in the mode of goodness. No, we are talking about devotees cent percent dedicated to the devotional service of preaching. They become consistent, remain consistent, and go on to make wonderful results because there is no passion. And the proof is they maintain their position week after week.

Sometimes we get a new rising star on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, who lasts for one year and then burns out. Preaching and book distribution are not a one-year's or even a ten-years' work. They are your life's work. Therefore you should deal with yourself and your environment in such a way that you maintain a consistent position and steadily increase. When you make such a plan, you can understand that you are cent percent heading back to Kṛṣṇaloka.

sub=Book Distribution Is Nobody's Nature

Book distribution, especially when it is done on the pure platform, has nothing to do with the material qualities of <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em>. It is a transcendental activity. If it has any relation, it relates to the brahminical category. It is irrelevant to say, "It's not my material nature to distribute books,” because it is nobody's material nature to distribute Prabhupāda's books. Who was a book salesman before he joined Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Nobody. But if you go out and distribute books, then it is so pleasing to Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and all the great <em>ācāryas</em> that by their mercy you are spiritually lifted to a high level of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now, if you don't feel connected or satisfied with book distribution, then you haven't surrendered to it, because when you surrender you automatically become blissful.

sub=Doubters Have No Potency

The mind of an intelligent person, following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is only attracted by His mission. In other words, only those attracted and dedicated to the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa can be absorbed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement of Lord Caitanya. If one has inclinations toward Māyāvāda philosophy or doubts that Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya are the Supreme Personality of Godhead or that the mission of Gaura-Nitāi is the supreme mission, he will not have the transcendental potency to perform this wonderful <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

Your influence on this world is determined by your absorption in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, you cannot affect others. If you are thinking that this activity is materialistic, unimportant, or only for others, or that you will do it for some time but ultimately quit, then you cannot distribute. You must be fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and determined to distribute it. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a temporary manifestation; it is the eternal occupational duty of the soul.

There is no use trying to sit back and enjoy protection within this spiritual movement, wasting life in a lazy way. It is not sufficient to free oneself from material contamination. One has to positively place himself in spiritual service and activity. This spiritual service of transcendental distribution is so important that it is unending. There will always be someone to give books to. Only a fool thinks that everyone already has a book.

It is false to think that what you are doing is not relevant to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. If you are serving in the temple, that is relevant also, because you are supporting book distribution. It is like a house. You may not consider the foundation important, because you cannot see it under the earth, but without a foundation, the building will fall down. All parts of this ISKCON house are important, but some parts are more visible. The book distributors belong to the visible part. They are the representatives of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Thus their personal qualities and characteristics are so important. There is a big difference between receiving literature from a convinced distributor and an uncertain distributor. People get a good and powerful impression from a distributor who is convinced, and they read the book; but people are not inclined to read a book they were sold by material means from an uncertain distributor.

A neophyte distributor may take shelter of methods that are not so Kṛṣṇa conscious. That may be useful in the beginning so that he is able to distribute some books; but ultimately, he should work to develop and improve his consciousness. Although we are one big ISKCON team, we have to develop individually to make the team stronger. We develop by knowledge, a good standard of regulated life, and good association. Above all, we develop by hearing. Hear the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em>, and hear <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, the <em>Bhagavad-gīt</em>ā, and the other books of Śrīla Prabhupāda's! Don't become lazy and decide to stop hearing. Hear! Chant! Remember! Learn our philosophy! Learn good qualities! Then your personal character will develop, and the deep austerity performed on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> will bring out your transcendental knowledge and realizations. Then when you meet people, they will be very happy they met you.

Book distribution is not limited by material conceptions. It is the only preaching that makes a deep and lasting impression on all the people. Therefore we want to flood the world with these books. All other kinds of preaching to attract people to join Kṛṣṇa consciousness and help them perform devotional service are supplementary and complementary to book distribution. Book distribution is the most important service within the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Never for a moment doubt it! Never think other things are more important!

sub=To Stop Distributing Is Spiritual Death

Marathon prevents us from becoming monkeys engaged in activities for material benefit, <em>grāmya-karma</em>. Now that the marathon is going on, we are working hard and losing our attachment to the material body. This purifying atmosphere has to be kept up, even if it is difficult. First, we are not going to let you stop; we will keep kicking you out the door. And second, it is not good for you to stop. Therefore we are going to continue this marathon until it becomes our way of life. When you breathe, think, talk, and act for the sake of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, then you are living.

One cannot just send out a few book distributors in an attempt to avoid surrendering, because the power of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission comes from everyone's cumulative strength. When everyone has the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spirit and stands behind the mission, everyone is a source of power, or śakti, for the book distributors, but when a place is pervaded with a non-<em>saṅkīrtana</em> mood, everyone sucks away the <em>śakti</em> from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

I can implant some desire within you, but the desire that takes off and does wonders comes from you. I can set up a perfect arena for your desire to burn. I set up the bricks, the sand, the salt on the bricks, the necessary <em>yantras</em>, and the fruit around the fire <em>yajña</em>. I put the camphor here and the sticks there. Śrīla Prabhupāda lights the fire, and I pour on some ghee. But you have to pour on more ghee and add more wood. You keep the fire burning. If you don't keep it burning, then what hope is there? If we don't create some strong men and women with a burning desire to please the spiritual master and do something wonderful, then there is no hope. You have to turn around and start accomplishing things for the spiritual master. He should not have to work all the time just to get you to do something. It is about time to accept some responsibility. Each one of us has to take the responsibility to distribute these books. It is a mission! You should not just do it because you are told to do it. The hot flame of desire burning within your heart should impel you to do it. You cannot imagine how blissful and how strong you will become.

How can we increase our desire? Rise early in the morning, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and follow the four regulative principles. These things are important. But deep in your heart you have to realize that unless you stand on your own two feet, you are not going to succeed. At one point you have to grow up and take responsibility. This mission—book publication and distribution—is your mission. Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “It's your movement,” and I am saying the same thing, "It's your mission.” You just have to realize it. Prabhupāda used to say, “I'm an old man. I can die at any moment," and I say, “I'm not so old, but I also can die at any moment." And then what? There is no use having a movement where everyone leans on someone else, because as soon as that someone steps away, everything falls apart. You have to realize that this is your mission. Think about this. Meditate on it. Take that mission and run with it. We want convinced devotees who can preach, save others, and go back to Godhead themselves, not dead bodies propped up with a stick from behind, who fall apart or disappear when it comes time to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

When we are all engaging in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, strong people will be attracted to join our movement— people we don't have to hold up with a stick. Therefore we should use this marathon time as an opportunity to take up that mission if we haven't already done so, to renew that mission if we have given it up, and to keep on going if we have already committed our lives to it. Just don't stop!
