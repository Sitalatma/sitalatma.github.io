                        <div id="bb13207" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The conception of God and the conception of Absolute Truth are not on the same level. The <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> hits on the target of the Absolute Truth. The conception of God indicates the controller, whereas the conception of the Absolute Truth indicates the <i>summum bonum - <span style="color:#990012">สุมฺมุมฺ โพนุมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สุมฺมุมฺ โพนุมฺ</span></i> or the ultimate source of all energies. There is no difference of opinion about the personal feature of God as the controller because a controller cannot be impersonal. Of course modern government, especially democratic government, is impersonal to some extent, but ultimately the chief executive head is a person, and the impersonal feature of government is subordinate to the personal feature. So without a doubt whenever we refer to control over others we must admit the existence of a personal feature. Because there are different controllers for different managerial positions, there may be many small gods. According to the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> any controller who has some specific extraordinary power is called a <i>vibhūtimat sattva, - <span style="color:#990012">วิภูติมตฺ สตฺตฺว,</span></i> or controller empowered by the Lord. There are many <i>vibhūtimat sattvas, - <span style="color:#990012">วิภูติมตฺ สตฺตฺวสฺ,</span></i> controllers or gods with various specific powers, but the Absolute Truth is one without a second. This <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> designates the Absolute Truth or the <i>summum bonum</i> as the <i>paraṁ satyam. - <span style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺ.</span></i></p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13208" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The author of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> Śrīla Vyāsadeva, first offers his respectful obeisances unto the <i>paraṁ satyam - <span style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรํ สตฺยมฺ</span></i> (Absolute Truth), and because the <i>paraṁ satyam</i> is the ultimate source of all energies, the <i>paraṁ satyam</i> is the Supreme Person. The gods or the controllers are undoubtedly persons, but the <i>paraṁ satyam</i> from whom the gods derive powers of control is the Supreme Person. The Sanskrit word <i>īśvara - <span style="color:#990012">อีศฺวร</span></i> (controller) conveys the import of God, but the Supreme Person is called the <i>parameśvara, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรเมศฺวร,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปรเมศฺวร,</span></i> or the supreme <i>īśvara. - <span style="color:#990012">อีศฺวร.</span></i> The Supreme Person, or <i>parameśvara,</i> is the supreme conscious personality, and because He does not derive any power from any other source, He is supremely independent. In the Vedic literatures Brahmā is described as the supreme god or the head of all other gods like Indra, Candra and Varuṇa, but the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> confirms that even Brahmā is not independent as far as his power and knowledge are concerned. He received knowledge in the form of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> from the Supreme Person who resides within the heart of every living being. That Supreme Personality knows everything directly and indirectly. Individual infinitesimal persons, who are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality, may know directly and indirectly everything about their bodies or external features, but the Supreme Personality knows everything about both His external and internal features.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13209" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The words <i>janmādy asya - <span style="color:#990012">ชนฺมาทฺยฺ อสฺย</span></i> suggest that the source of all production, maintenance or destruction is the same supreme conscious person. Even in our present experience we can know that nothing is generated from inert matter, but inert matter can be generated from the living entity. For instance, by contact with the living entity, the material body develops into a working machine. Men with a poor fund of knowledge mistake the bodily machinery to be the living being, but the fact is that the living being is the basis of the bodily machine. The bodily machine is useless as soon as the living spark is away from it. Similarly, the original source of all material energy is the Supreme Person. This fact is expressed in all the Vedic literatures, and all the exponents of spiritual science have accepted this truth. The living force is called Brahman, and one of the greatest <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> (teachers), namely Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, has preached that Brahman is substance whereas the cosmic world is category. The original source of all energies is the living force, and He is logically accepted as the Supreme Person. He is therefore conscious of everything past, present and future, and also of each and every corner of His manifestations, both material and spiritual. An imperfect living being does not even know what is happening within his own personal body. He eats his food but does not know how this food is transformed into energy or how it sustains his body. When a living being is perfect, he is aware of everything that happens, and since the Supreme Person is all-perfect, it is quite natural that He knows everything in all detail. Consequently the perfect personality is addressed in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> as Vāsudeva, or one who lives everywhere in full consciousness and in full possession of His complete energy. All of this is clearly explained in the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> and the reader has ample opportunity to study this critically.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13210" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the modern age Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> by practical demonstration. It is easier to penetrate into the topics of the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> through the medium of Śrī Caitanya’s causeless mercy. Therefore a short sketch of His life and precepts is inserted herein to help the reader understand the real merit of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i></p></div>

Since Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He is both Bhagavān and <i>Bhāgavatam</i> in person and in sound. Therefore His process of approaching the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> is practical for all people of the world.

His first wife was Śrīmatī Lakṣmīpriyā, who died at an early age when the Lord was away from home. When He returned from East Bengal He was requested by His mother to accept a second wife, and He agreed. His second wife was Śrīmatī Viṣṇupriyā Devī, who bore the separation of the Lord throughout her life because the Lord took the order of <i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span></i> at the age of twenty-four, when Śrīmatī Viṣṇupriyā was barely sixteen years old.</p></div>

For six years of this time He traveled continuously all over India (and especially throughout southern India) preaching the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i></p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13221" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Caitanya not only - <span style="color:#990012">โอนฺลฺยฺ</span> preached the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> but propagated the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> as well in the most practical way. In the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is depicted as the Absolute Personality of Godhead, and His last teachings in that great book of transcendental knowledge instruct that one should give up all the modes of religious activities and accept Him (Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa) as the <i>only</i> worshipable Lord. The Lord then assured that all His devotees would be protected from all sorts of sinful acts and that for them there would be no cause for anxiety.</p></div>

Such men with a poor fund of knowledge are misled by many nondevotees. Thus the teachings of the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> were misinterpreted even by great scholars. After the disappearance of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa there were hundreds of commentaries on the <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> by many erudite scholars, and almost every one of them was motivated by self-interest.</p></div>

This time, however, He appeared as a great devotee of the Lord in order to preach to the people in general, as well as to religionists and philosophers, about the transcendental position of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the primeval Lord and the cause of all causes. The essence of His preaching is that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who appeared at Vrajabhūmi (Vṛndāvana) as the son of the King of Vraja (Nanda Mahārāja), is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is therefore worshipable by all. Vṛndāvana-dhāma is nondifferent from the Lord because the name, fame, form and place where the Lord manifests Himself are all identical with the Lord as absolute knowledge. Therefore Vṛndāvana-dhāma is as worshipable as the Lord. The highest form of transcendental worship of the Lord was exhibited by the damsels of Vrajabhūmi in the form of pure affection for the Lord, and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends this process as the most excellent mode of worship. He accepts the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavata Purāṇa - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควต ปุราณ</span></i> as the spotless literature for understanding the Lord, and He preaches that the ultimate goal of life for all human beings is to attain the stage of <i>premā, - <span style="color:#990012">เปฺรมา,</span></i> or love of God.</p></div>

Such literatures are all based on the <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> like the <i>Vedas, Purāṇas, Upaniṣads, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ, ปุราณสฺ, อุปนิษทฺสฺ, รามายณ, มหาภารต</span></i> and other histories and authentic literatures approved by the recognized <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ.</span></i> They are unique in composition and unrivaled in presentation, and they are full of transcendental knowledge.

These two devotees recorded practically all the incidents of the Lord’s activities, and later on all the books dealing with the Lord, which are above mentioned, were composed on the basis of <i>kaḍacās - <span style="color:#990012">กฑจาสฺ</span></i> (notebooks) by Śrīla Dāmodara Gosvāmī and Murāri Gupta.</p></div>

During the hours of eclipse it was the custom of the Hindu public to take bath in the Ganges or any other sacred river and chant the Vedic <i>mantras - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> for purification.

There are innumerable names of the Lord both in India and outside, and all of them are equally good because all of them indicate the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because these sixteen are especially recommended for this age, people should take advantage of them and follow the path of the great <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> who attained success by practicing the rules of the <i>śāstras</i> (revealed scriptures).</p></div>

In this present age quarrels take place even over trifles, and therefore the <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> have recommended for this age a common platform for realization, namely chanting the holy names of the Lord. People can hold meetings to glorify the Lord in their respective languages and with melodious songs, and if such performances are executed in an offenseless manner, it is certain that the participants will gradually attain spiritual perfection without having to undergo more rigorous methods. At such meetings everyone, the learned and the foolish, the rich and the poor, the Hindus and the Muslims, the Englishmen and the Indians, and the <i>caṇḍālas - <span style="color:#990012">จณฺฑาลสฺ</span></i> and the <i>brāhmaṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ,</span></i> can all hear the transcendental sounds and thus cleanse the dust of material association from the mirror of the heart. To confirm the Lord’s mission, all the people of the world will accept the holy name of the Lord as the common platform for the universal religion of mankind. In other words, the advent of the holy name took place along with the advent of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13229" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When the Lord was on the lap of His mother, He would at once stop crying as soon as the ladies surrounding Him chanted the holy names and clapped their hands. This peculiar incident was observed by the neighbors with awe and veneration. Sometimes the young girls took pleasure in making the Lord cry and then stopping Him by chanting the holy name. So from His very childhood the Lord began to preach the importance of the holy name. In His early age Lord Śrī Caitanya was known as Nimāi. This name was given by His beloved mother because the Lord took His birth beneath a <i>nimba - <span style="color:#990012">นิมฺพ</span></i> tree in the courtyard of His paternal house.</p></div>

At this time it was customary to offer the child both coins and books in order to get some indication of the future tendencies of the child. The Lord was offered on one side coins and on the other the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> The Lord accepted the <i>Bhāgavatam</i> instead of the coins.</p></div>

All the members of the house were struck with fear and awe, but after a little while the snake went away, and the baby was taken away by His mother. Once He was stolen by a thief who intended to steal His ornaments, but the Lord took a pleasure trip on the shoulder of the bewildered thief, who was searching for a solitary place in order to rob the baby. It so happened that the thief, wandering hither and thither, finally arrived just before the house of Jagannātha Miśra and, being afraid of being caught, dropped the baby at once. Of course the anxious parents and relatives were glad to see the lost child.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13232" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Once a pilgrim <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> was received at the house of Jagannātha Miśra, and when he was offering food to the Godhead, the Lord appeared before him and partook of the prepared food. The eatables had to be rejected because the child touched them, and so the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> had to make another preparation. The next time the same thing happened, and when this happened repeatedly for the third time, the baby was finally put to bed. At about twelve at night when all the members of the house were fast asleep within their closed rooms, the pilgrim <i>brāhmaṇa</i> offered his specially prepared foods to the Deity, and, in the same way, the baby Lord appeared before the pilgrim and spoiled his offerings. The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> then began to cry, but since everyone was fast asleep, no one could hear him. At that time the baby Lord appeared before the fortunate <i>brāhmaṇa</i> and disclosed His identity as Kṛṣṇa Himself. The <i>brāhmaṇa</i> was forbidden to disclose this incident, and the baby returned to the lap of His mother.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13233" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are many similar incidents in His childhood. As a naughty boy He sometimes used to tease the orthodox <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> who used to bathe in the Ganges. When the <i>brāhmaṇas</i> complained to His father that He was splashing them with water instead of attending school, the Lord suddenly appeared before His father as though just coming from school with all His school clothes and books. At the bathing <i>ghāṭa - <span style="color:#990012">ฆาฏ</span></i> He also used to play jokes on the neighboring girls who engaged in worshiping Śiva in hopes of getting good husbands. This is a common practice amongst unmarried girls in Hindu families. While they were engaged in such worship, the Lord naughtily appeared before them and said, “My dear sisters, please give Me all the offerings you have just brought for Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is My devotee, and Pārvatī is My maidservant. If you worship Me, then Lord Śiva and all the other demigods will be more satisfied.” Some of them refused to obey the naughty Lord, and He would curse them that due to their refusal they would be married to old men who had seven children by their previous wives. Out of fear and sometimes out of love the girls would also offer Him various goods, and then the Lord would bless them and assure them that they would have very good young husbands and that they would be mothers of dozens of children. The blessings would enliven the girls, but they used often to complain of these incidents to their mothers.</p></div>

Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, in order to please the Lord, later composed a grammar in Sanskrit, in which all the rules of grammar were explained with examples that used the holy names of the Lord. This grammar is still current. It is known as <i>Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa - <span style="color:#990012">หริ-นามามฺฤต-วฺยากรณ</span></i> and is prescribed in the syllabus of schools in Bengal.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13235" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>During this time a great Kashmir scholar named Keśava Kāśmīri came to Navadvīpa to hold discussions on the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> The Kashmir <i>paṇḍita - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span></i> was a champion scholar, and he had traveled to all places of learning in India. Finally he came to Navadvīpa to contest the learned <i>paṇḍitas - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิตสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิตสฺ</span></i> there. The <i>paṇḍitas</i> of Navadvīpa decided to match Nimāi Paṇḍita (Lord Caitanya) with the Kashmir <i>paṇḍita, - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต,</span></i> thinking that if Nimāi Paṇḍita were defeated, they would have another chance to debate with the scholar, for Nimāi Paṇḍita was only a boy. And if the Kashmir <i>paṇḍita</i> were defeated, then they would even be more glorified because people would proclaim that a mere boy of Navadvīpa had defeated a champion scholar who was famous throughout India. It so happened that Nimāi Paṇḍita met Keśava Kāśmīri while strolling on the banks of the Ganges. The Lord requested him to compose a Sanskrit verse in praise of the Ganges, and the <i>paṇḍita</i> within a short time composed a hundred <i>śloka - <span style="color:#990012">โศฺลก</span>s - <span style="color:#990012">โศฺลกสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">โศฺลกสฺ,</span></i> reciting the verses like a storm and showing the strength of his vast learning. Nimāi Paṇḍita at once memorized all the <i>ślokas</i> without an error. He quoted the sixty-fourth <i>śloka</i> and pointed out certain rhetorical and literary irregularities. He particularly questioned the <i>paṇḍita’s - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต′สฺ</span></i> use of the word <i>bhavānī-bhartuḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ภวานี-ภรฺตุฮ.</span></i> He pointed out that the use of this word was redundant. <i>Bhavānī - <span style="color:#990012">ภวานี</span></i> means the wife of Śiva, and who else can be her <i>bhartā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภรฺตา,</span></i> or husband? He also pointed out several other discrepancies, and the Kashmir <i>paṇḍita</i> was struck with wonder. He was astonished that a mere student of grammar could point out the literary mistakes of an erudite scholar. Although this matter was ended prior to any public meeting, the news spread like wildfire all over Navadvīpa. But finally Keśava Kāśmīri was ordered in a dream by Sarasvatī, the goddess of learning, to submit to the Lord, and thus the Kashmir <i>paṇḍita</i> became a follower of the Lord.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13236" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord was then married with great pomp and gaiety, and at this time He began to preach the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord at Navadvīpa. Some of the <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> became envious of His popularity, and they put many hindrances on His path. They were so jealous that they finally took the matter before the Muslim magistrate at Navadvīpa. Bengal was then governed by Pathans, and the governor of the province was Nawab Hussain Shah. The Muslim magistrate of Navadvīpa took up the complaints of the <i>brāhmaṇas</i> seriously, and at first he warned the followers of Nimāi Paṇḍita not to chant loudly the name of Hari. But Lord Caitanya asked His followers to disobey the orders of the Kazi, and they went on with their <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> (chanting) party as usual. The magistrate then sent constables who interrupted a <i>saṅkīrtana</i> and broke some of the <i>mṛdaṅgas - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤทงฺคสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">มฺฤทงฺคสฺ</span></i> (drums). When Nimāi Paṇḍita heard of this incident He organized a party for civil disobedience. He is the pioneer of the civil disobedience movement in India for the right cause. He organized a procession of one hundred thousand men with thousands of <i>mṛdaṅgas</i> and <i>karatālas - <span style="color:#990012">กรตาลสฺ</span></i> (hand cymbals), and this procession passed over the roads of Navadvīpa in defiance of the Kazi who had issued the order. Finally the procession reached the house of the Kazi, who went upstairs out of fear of the masses. The great crowds assembled at the Kazi’s house displayed a violent temper, but the Lord asked them to be peaceful. At this time the Kazi came down and tried to pacify the Lord by addressing Him as nephew. He pointed out that he referred to Nīlāmbara Cakravartī as uncle, and thus Śrīmatī Śacīdevī, Nimāi Paṇḍita’s mother, was his cousin-sister. He asked the Lord whether his sister’s son could be angry at His maternal uncle, and the Lord replied that since the Kazi was His maternal uncle he should receive his nephew well at his home. In this way the issue was mitigated, and the two learned scholars began a long discussion on the Koran and Hindu <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> The Lord raised the question of cow-killing, and the Kazi properly answered Him by referring to the Koran. In turn the Kazi also questioned the Lord about cow sacrifice in the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> and the Lord replied that such sacrifice as mentioned in the <i>Vedas</i> is not actually cow-killing. In that sacrifice an old bull or cow was sacrificed for the sake of receiving a fresh younger life by the power of Vedic <i>mantras. - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> But in the Kali-yuga such cow sacrifices are forbidden because there are no qualified <i>brāhmaṇas</i> capable of conducting such a sacrifice. In fact, in Kali-yuga all <i>yajñas - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญสฺ</span></i> (sacrifices) are forbidden because they are useless attempts by foolish men. In Kali-yuga only the <i>saṅkīrtana yajña - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน ยชฺญ</span></i> is recommended for all practical purposes. Speaking in this way, the Lord finally convinced the Kazi, who became the Lord’s follower. The Kazi thenceforth declared that no one should hinder the <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement which was started by the Lord, and the Kazi left this order in his will for the sake of progeny. The Kazi’s tomb still exists in the area of Navadvīpa, and Hindu pilgrims go there to show their respects. The Kazi’s descendants are residents, and they never objected to <i>saṅkīrtana, - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน,</span></i> even during the Hindu-Muslim riot days.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13237" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This incident shows clearly that the Lord was not a so-called timid Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava is a fearless devotee of the Lord, and for the right cause he can take any step suitable for the purpose. Arjuna was also a Vaiṣṇava devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and he fought valiantly for the satisfaction of the Lord. Similarly, Vajrāṅgajī, or Hanumān, was also a devotee of Lord Rāma, and he gave lessons to the nondevotee party of Rāvaṇa. The principles of Vaiṣṇavism are to satisfy the Lord by all means. A Vaiṣṇava is by nature a nonviolent, peaceful living being, and he has all the good qualities of God, but when the nondevotee blasphemes the Lord or His devotee, the Vaiṣṇava never tolerates such impudency.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13238" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>After this incident the Lord began to preach and propagate His <i>Bhāgavata-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span></i> or <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement, more vigorously, and whoever stood against this propagation of the <i>yuga-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ยุค-ธรฺม,</span></i> or duty of the age, was properly punished by various types of chastisement. Two <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> gentlemen named Cāpala and Gopāla, who also happened to be maternal uncles of the Lord, were inflicted with leprosy by way of chastisement, and later, when they were repentant, they were accepted by the Lord. In the course of His preaching work, He used to send daily all His followers, including Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu and Ṭhākura Haridāsa, two chief whips of His party, from door to door to preach the <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> All of Navadvīpa was surcharged with His <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement, and His headquarters were situated at the house of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura and Śrī Advaita Prabhu, two of His chief householder disciples. These two learned heads of the <i>brāhmaṇa</i> community were the most ardent supporters of Lord Caitanya’s movement. Śrī Advaita Prabhu was the chief cause for the advent of the Lord. When Advaita Prabhu saw that the total human society was full of materialistic activities and devoid of devotional service, which alone could save mankind from the threefold miseries of material existence, He, out of His causeless compassion for the age-worn human society, prayed fervently for the incarnation of the Lord and continually worshiped the Lord with water of the Ganges and leaves of the holy <i>tulasī - <span style="color:#990012">ตุลสี</span></i> tree. As far as preaching work in the <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement was concerned, everyone was expected to do his daily share according to the order of the Lord.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13239" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Once Nityānanda Prabhu and Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura were walking down a main road, and on the way they saw a roaring crowd assembled. Upon inquiring from passersby, they understood that two brothers, named Jagāi and Mādhāi, were creating a public disturbance in a drunken state. They also heard that these two brothers were born in a respectable <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> family, but because of low association they had turned into debauchees of the worst type. They were not only drunkards but also meat-eaters, woman-hunters, dacoits and sinners of all description. Śrīla Nityānanda Prabhu heard all of these stories and decided that these two fallen souls must be the first to be delivered. If they were delivered from their sinful life, then the good name of Lord Caitanya would be even still more glorified. Thinking in this way, Nityānanda Prabhu and Haridāsa pushed their way through the crowd and asked the two brothers to chant the holy name of Lord Hari. The drunken brothers became enraged upon this request and attacked Nityānanda Prabhu with filthy language. Both brothers chased them a considerable distance. In the evening the report of the preaching work was submitted to the Lord, and He was glad to learn that Nityānanda and Haridāsa had attempted to deliver such a stupid pair of fellows.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13240" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The next day Nityānanda Prabhu went to see the brothers, and as soon as He approached them one of them threw a piece of earthen pot at Him. This struck Him on the forehead, and immediately blood began to flow. But Nityānanda Prabhu was so kind that instead of protesting this heinous act, He said, “It does not matter that you have thrown this stone at Me. I still request you to chant the holy name of Lord Hari.”</p></div>

When Mādhāi again attempted to hurt Nityānanda Prabhu, Jagāi stopped him and implored him to fall down at His feet. In the meantime the news of Nityānanda’s injury reached the Lord, who at once hurried to the spot in a fiery and angry mood. The Lord immediately invoked His Sudarśana <i>cakra - <span style="color:#990012">จกฺร</span></i> (the Lord’s ultimate weapon, shaped like a wheel) to kill the sinners, but Nityānanda Prabhu reminded Him of His mission. The mission of the Lord was to deliver the hopelessly fallen souls of Kali-yuga, and the brothers Jagāi and Mādhāi were typical examples of these fallen souls. Ninety percent of the population of this age resembles these brothers, despite high birth and mundane respectability. According to the verdict of the revealed scriptures, the total population of the world in this age will be of the lowest <i>śūdra - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span></i> quality, or even lower. It should be noted that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never acknowledged the stereotyped caste system by birthright; rather, He strictly followed the verdict of the <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> in the matter of one’s <i>svarūpa, - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวรูป,</span></i> or real identity.</p></div>

The Lord was also asked by Nityānanda Prabhu to accept these repenting souls, and the Lord agreed to accept them on one condition, that they henceforward completely give up all their sinful activities and habits of debauchery. Both the brothers agreed and promised to give up all their sinful habits, and the kind Lord accepted them and did not again refer to their past misdeeds.</p></div>

He asked the devotees what they wanted to eat, and when He was informed that they wanted to eat mangoes, He asked for a seed of a mango, although this fruit was out of season. When the seed was brought to Him He sowed it in the yard of Śrīnivāsa, and at once a creeper began to grow out of the seed. Within no time this creeper became a full-grown mango tree heavy with more ripened fruits than the devotees could eat.

Out of sheer foolishness they asked the Lord why He was chanting the names of the <i>gopīs</i> and advised Him to chant the name of Kṛṣṇa. The Lord, who was in ecstasy, was thus disturbed by these foolish students. He chastised them and chased them away. The students were almost the same age as the Lord, and thus they wrongly thought of the Lord as one of their peers.

If they are to begin their life of spiritual realization, they must some way or another offer obeisances unto Me.” Thus the Lord decided to accept the renounced order of life (<i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span></i>) because people in general were inclined to offer respects to a <i>sannyāsī. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี.</span></i></p></div>

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not very much in favor of the renounced order of life in this Age of Kali, but that was only for the reason that very few <i>sannyāsīs - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีสฺ</span></i> in this age are able to observe the rules and regulations of <i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span></i> life.

For three continuous days He traveled in the Rāḍha-deśa (places where the Ganges does not flow). He was in full ecstasy over the idea of going to Vṛndāvana. However, Śrīla Nityānanda diverted His path and brought Him instead to the house of Advaita Prabhu in Śāntipura. The Lord stayed at Śrī Advaita Prabhu’s house for a few days, and knowing well that the Lord was leaving His hearth and home for good, Śrī Advaita Prabhu sent His men to Navadvīpa to bring mother Śacī to have a last meeting with her son. Some unscrupulous people say that Lord Caitanya met His wife also after taking <i>sannyāsa</i> and offered her His wooden slipper for worship, but the authentic sources give no information about such a meeting. His mother met Him at the house of Advaita Prabhu, and when she saw her son in <i>sannyāsa</i> dress, she lamented. By way of compromise, she requested her son to make His headquarters in Purī so that she would easily be able to get information about Him. The Lord granted this last desire of His beloved mother. After this incident the Lord started for Purī, leaving all the residents of Navadvīpa in an ocean of lamentation over His separation.</p></div>

He visited the temple of Gopīnāthajī, who had stolen condensed milk for His devotee Śrīla Mādhavendra Purī. Since then Deity Gopīnāthajī is well known as Kṣīra-corā-gopīnātha. The Lord relished this story with great pleasure. The propensity of stealing is there even in the absolute consciousness, but because this propensity is exhibited by the Absolute, it loses its perverted nature and thus becomes worshipable even by Lord Caitanya on the basis of the absolute consideration that the Lord and His stealing propensity are one and identical. This interesting story of Gopīnāthajī is vividly explained in the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span></i> by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī.</p></div>

The Lord heard the story of Sākṣi-gopāla with great pleasure because He wanted to impress upon the atheists that the worshipable Deities in the temples approved by the great <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> are not idols, as alleged by men with a poor fund of knowledge. The Deity in the temple is the <i>arcā - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span></i> incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, and thus the Deity is identical with the Lord in all respects. He responds to the proportion of the devotee’s affection for Him. In the story of Sākṣi-gopāla, in which there was a family misunderstanding by two devotees of the Lord, the Lord, in order to mitigate the turmoil as well as to show specific favor to His servitors, traveled from Vṛndāvana to Vidyānagara, a village in Orissa, in the form of His <i>arcā</i> incarnation. From there the Deity was brought to Cuttack, and thus the temple of Sākṣi-gopāla is even today visited by thousands of pilgrims on the way to Jagannātha Purī. The Lord stayed overnight there and began to proceed toward Purī. On the way, His <i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span></i> rod was broken by Nityānanda Prabhu. The Lord became apparently angry with Him about this and went alone to Purī, leaving His companions behind.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13255" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At Purī, when He entered the temple of Jagannātha, He became at once saturated with transcendental ecstasy and fell down on the floor of the temple unconscious. The custodians of the temple could not understand the transcendental feats of the Lord, but there was a great learned <i>paṇḍita - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต</span></i> named Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was present, and he could understand that the Lord’s losing His consciousness upon entering the Jagannātha temple was not an ordinary thing. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who was the chief appointed <i>paṇḍita</i> in the court of the King of Orissa, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, was attracted by the youthful luster of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and could understand that such a transcendental trance was only rarely exhibited and only then by the topmost devotees who are already on the transcendental plane in complete forgetfulness of material existence. Only a liberated soul could show such a transcendental feat, and the Bhaṭṭācārya, who was vastly learned, could understand this in the light of the transcendental literature with which he was familiar. He therefore asked the custodians of the temple not to disturb the unknown <i>sannyāsī. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี.</span></i> He asked them to take the Lord to his home so He could be further observed in His unconscious state. The Lord was at once carried to the home of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who at that time had sufficient power of authority due to his being the <i>sabhā-paṇḍita, - <span style="color:#990012">สภา-ปณฺฑิต,</span></i> or the state dean of faculty in Sanskrit literatures. The learned <i>paṇḍita</i> wanted to scrutinizingly test the transcendental feats of Lord Caitanya because often unscrupulous devotees imitate physical feats in order to flaunt transcendental achievements just to attract innocent people and take advantage of them. A learned scholar like the Bhaṭṭācārya can detect such imposters, and when he finds them out he at once rejects them.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13256" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the case of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Bhaṭṭācārya tested all the symptoms in the light of the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> He tested as a scientist, not as a foolish sentimentalist. He observed the movement of the stomach, the beating of the heart and the breathing of the nostrils. He also felt the pulse of the Lord and saw that all His bodily activities were in complete suspension. When he put a small cotton swab before the nostrils, he found that there was a slight breathing as the fine fibers of cotton moved slightly. Thus he came to know that the Lord’s unconscious trance was genuine, and he began to treat Him in the prescribed fashion. But Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu could only be treated in a special way. He would respond only to the resounding of the holy names of the Lord by His devotees. This special treatment was unknown to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya because the Lord was still unknown to him. When the Bhaṭṭācārya saw Him for the first time in the temple, he simply took Him to be one of many pilgrims.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13257" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the meantime the companions of the Lord, who reached the temple a little after Him, heard of the Lord’s transcendental feats and of His being carried away by the Bhaṭṭācārya. The pilgrims at the temple were still gossiping about the incident. But by chance, one of these pilgrims had met Gopīnātha Ācārya, who was known to Gadādhara Paṇḍita, and from him it was learned that the Lord was lying in an unconscious state at the residence of Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, who happened to be the brother-in-law of Gopīnātha Ācārya. All the members of the party were introduced by Gadādhara Paṇḍita to Gopīnātha Ācārya, who took them all to the house of Bhaṭṭācārya, where the Lord was lying unconscious in a spiritual trance. All the members then chanted loudly the holy name of the Lord Hari as usual, and the Lord regained His consciousness. After this, Bhaṭṭācārya received all the members of the party, including Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, and asked them to become his guests of honor. The party, including the Lord, went for a bath in the sea, and the Bhaṭṭācārya arranged for their residence and meals at the house of Kāśī Miśra. Gopīnātha Ācārya, his brother-in-law, also assisted. There were some friendly talks about the Lord’s divinity between the two brothers-in-law, and in this argument Gopīnātha Ācārya, who knew the Lord before, now tried to establish the Lord as the Personality of Godhead, and the Bhaṭṭācārya tried to establish Him as one of the great devotees. Both of them argued from the angle of vision of authentic <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> and not on the strength of sentimental <i>vox populi. - <span style="color:#990012">โว โปปุลิ.</span></i> The incarnations of God are determined by authentic <i>śāstras</i> and not by popular votes of foolish fanatics. Because Lord Caitanya was an incarnation of God in fact, foolish fanatics have proclaimed so many so-called incarnations of God in this age without referring to authentic scriptures. But Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya or Gopīnātha Ācārya did not indulge in such foolish sentimentalism; on the contrary, both of them tried to establish or reject His divinity on the strength of authentic <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i></p></div>

We shall, however, give herewith a summary of the conversation.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13305" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was a self-realized soul, although outwardly he belonged to a caste lower than the <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> in social status. He was not in the renounced order of life, and besides that he was a high government servant in the state. Still, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted him as a liberated soul on the strength of the high order of his realization of transcendental knowledge. Similarly, the Lord accepted Śrīla Haridāsa Ṭhākura, a veteran devotee of the Lord coming from a Mohammedan family. And there are many other great devotees of the Lord who came from different communities, sects and castes. The Lord’s only criterion was the standard of devotional service of the particular person. He was not concerned with the outward dress of a man; He was concerned only with the inner soul and its activities. Therefore all the missionary activities of the Lord are to be understood to be on the spiritual plane, and as such the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or the cult of <i>Bhāgavata-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span></i> has nothing to do with mundane affairs, sociology, politics, economic development or any such sphere of life. <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> is the purely transcendental urge of the soul.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13306" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When He met Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya on the bank of the Godāvarī, the <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span>-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span> - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span></i> followed by the Hindus was mentioned by the Lord. Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya said that by following the principles of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม,</span></i> the system of four castes and four orders of human life, everyone could realize Transcendence. In the opinion of the Lord, the system of <i>varṇāśrama-dharma</i> is superficial only, and it has very little to do with the highest realization of spiritual values. The highest perfection of life is to get detached from the material attachment and proportionately realize the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead recognizes a living being who is progressing in that line. Devotional service, therefore, is the culmination of the culture of all knowledge. When Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared for the deliverance of all fallen souls, He advised the deliverance of all living entities as follows. The Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, from whom all living entities have emanated, must be worshiped by all their respective engagements, because everything that we see is also the expansion of His energy. That is the way of real perfection, and it is approved by all bona fide <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> past and present. The system of <i>varṇāśrama</i> is more or less based on moral and ethical principles. There is very little realization of the Transcendence as such, and Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected it as superficial and asked Rāmānanda Rāya to go further into the matter.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13307" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya then suggested renunciation of fruitive actions unto the Lord. The <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.27) advises in this connection: “Whatever you do, whatever you eat and whatever you give, as well as whatever you perform in penance, offer to Me alone.” This dedication on the part of the worker suggests that the Personality of Godhead is a step higher than the impersonal conception of the <i>varṇāśrama - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม</span></i> system, but still the relation of the living being and the Lord is not distinct in that way. The Lord therefore rejected this proposition and asked Rāmānanda Rāya to go further.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13308" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Rāya then suggested renunciation of the <i>varṇāśrama-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">วรฺณาศฺรม-ธรฺม</span></i> and acceptance of devotional service. The Lord did not approve of this suggestion also for the reason that all of a sudden one should not renounce his position, for that may not bring in the desired result.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13310" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It was further suggested by Rāya that attainment of spiritual realization freed from the material conception of life is the topmost achievement for a living being. The Lord rejected this suggestion also because on the plea of such spiritual realization much havoc has been wrought by unscrupulous persons; therefore all of a sudden this is not possible. The Rāya then suggested sincere association of self-realized souls and hearing submissively the transcendental message of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead. This suggestion was welcomed by the Lord. This suggestion was made following in the footsteps of Brahmājī, who said that the Personality of Godhead is known as <i>ajita - <span style="color:#990012">ชิต</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อชิต</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">อชิต,</span></i> or the one who cannot be conquered or approached by anyone. But such <i>ajita</i> also becomes <i>jita</i> (conquered) by one method, which is very simple and easy. The simple method is that one has to give up the arrogant attitude of declaring oneself to be God Himself. One must be very meek and submissive and try to live peacefully by lending the ear to the speeches of the transcendentally self-realized soul who speaks on the message of <i>Bhāgavata-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม,</span></i> or the religion of glorifying the Supreme Lord and His devotees. To glorify a great man is a natural instinct for living beings, but they have not learned to glorify the Lord. Perfection of life is attained simply by glorifying the Lord in association with a self-realized devotee of the Lord.* The self-realized devotee is he who surrenders unto the Lord fully and who does not have attachment for material prosperity. Material prosperity and sense enjoyment and their advancement are all activities of ignorance in human society. Peace and friendship are impossible for a society detached from the association of God and His devotees. It is imperative, therefore, that one sincerely seek the association of pure devotees and hear them patiently and submissively from any position of life. The position of a person in the higher or lower status of life does not hamper one in the path of self-realization. The only thing one has to do is to hear from a self-realized soul with a routine program. The teacher may also deliver lectures from the Vedic literatures, following in the footsteps of the bygone <i>ācāryas - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺยสฺ</span></i> who realized the Absolute Truth. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended this simple method of self-realization generally known as <i>Bhāgavata-dharma. - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต-ธรฺม.</span></i> <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> is the perfect guide for this purpose.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13311" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Above these topics discussed by the Lord and Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, there were still more elevated spiritual talks between the two great personalities, and we purposely withhold those topics for the present because one has to come to the spiritual plane before further talks with Rāmānanda Rāya can be heard. We have presented further talks of Śrīla Rāmānanda Rāya with the Lord in another book (<i>Teachings of Lord Caitanya - <span style="color:#990012">เตฉินฺคฺสฺ โอ โลรฺทฺ ไจตนฺย</span></i>).</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13312" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At the conclusion of this meeting, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya was advised by the Lord to retire from service and come to Purī so that they could live together and relish a transcendental relationship. Some time later, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya retired from the government service and took a pension from the King. He returned to his residence in Purī, where he was one of the most confidential devotees of the Lord. There was another gentleman at Purī of the name Śikhi Māhiti, who was also a confidant like Rāmānanda Rāya. The Lord used to hold confidential talks on spiritual values with three or four companions at Purī, and He passed eighteen years in that way in spiritual trance. His talks were recorded by His private secretary Śrī Dāmodara Gosvāmī, one of the four most intimate devotees.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13313" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord extensively traveled all over the southern part of India. The great saint of Mahārāṣṭra known as Saint Tukārāma was also initiated by the Lord. Saint Tukārāma, after initiation by the Lord, overflooded the whole of the Mahārāṣṭra Province with the <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement, and the transcendental flow is still rolling on in the southwestern part of the great Indian peninsula.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13315" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord excavated from South India two very important old literatures, namely the <i>Brahma-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-สํหิตา</span></i>* and <i>Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ-กรฺณามฺฤต,</span></i> and these two valuable books are authorized studies for the person in the devotional line. The Lord then returned to Purī after His South Indian tour.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13316" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>On His return to Purī, all the anxious devotees of the Lord got back their life, and the Lord remained there with continued pastimes of His transcendental realizations. The most important incident during that time was His granting audience to King Pratāparudra. King Pratāparudra was a great devotee of the Lord, and he considered himself to be one of the servants of the Lord entrusted with sweeping the temple. This submissive attitude of the King was very much appreciated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The King requested both Bhaṭṭācārya and Rāya to arrange his meeting with the Lord. When, however, the Lord was petitioned by His two stalwart devotees, He flatly refused to grant the request, even though it was put forward by personal associates like Rāmānanda Rāya and Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya. The Lord maintained that it is dangerous for a <i>sannyāsī - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี</span></i> to be in intimate touch with worldly money-conscious men and with women. The Lord was an ideal <i>sannyāsī. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี.</span></i> No woman could approach the Lord even to offer respects. Women’s seats were accommodated far away from the Lord. As an ideal teacher and <i>ācārya, - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">อาจารฺย,</span></i> He was very strict in the routine work of a <i>sannyāsī.</i> Apart from being a divine incarnation, the Lord was an ideal character as a human being. His behavior with other persons was also above suspicion. In His dealing as <i>ācārya,</i> He was harder than the thunderbolt and softer than the rose. One of His associates, Junior Haridāsa, committed a great mistake by lustfully glancing at a young woman. The Lord as Supersoul could detect this lust in the mind of Junior Haridāsa, who was at once banished from the Lord’s association and was never accepted again, even though the Lord was implored to excuse Haridāsa for the mistake. Junior Haridāsa afterwards committed suicide due to being disassociated from the company of the Lord, and the news of suicide was duly related to the Lord. Even at that time the Lord was not forgetful of the offense, and He said that Haridāsa had rightly met with the proper punishment.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13317" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>On the principles of the renounced order of life and discipline, the Lord knew no compromise, and therefore even though He knew that the King was a great devotee, He refused to see the King, only because the King was a dollar-and-cent man. By this example the Lord wanted to emphasize the proper behavior for a transcendentalist. A transcendentalist has nothing to do with women and money. He must always refrain from such intimate relations. The King was, however, favored by the Lord by the expert arrangement of the devotees. This means that the beloved devotee of the Lord can favor a neophyte more liberally than the Lord. Pure devotees, therefore, never commit an offense at the feet of another pure devotee. An offense at the lotus feet of the Lord is sometimes excused by the merciful Lord, but an offense at the feet of a devotee is very dangerous for one who actually wants to make progress in devotional service.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13318" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As long as the Lord remained at Purī, thousands of His devotees used to come to see Him during the Ratha-yātrā car festival of Lord Jagannātha. And during the car festival, the washing of the Guṇḍicā temple under the direct supervision of the Lord was an important function. The Lord’s congregational <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement at Purī was a unique exhibition for the mass of people. That is the way to turn the mass mind towards spiritual realization. The Lord inaugurated this system of mass <i>saṅkīrtana, - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน,</span></i> and leaders of all countries can take advantage of this spiritual movement in order to keep the mass of people in a pure state of peace and friendship with one another. This is now the demand of the present human society all over the world.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13319" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>After some time the Lord again started on His tour towards northern India, and He decided to visit Vṛndāvana and its neighboring places. He passed through the jungles of Jharikhaṇḍa (Madhya Bhārata), and all the wild animals also joined His <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement. The wild tigers, elephants, bears and deer all together accompanied the Lord, and the Lord accompanied them in <i>saṅkīrtana. - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน.</span></i> By this He proved that by the propagation of the <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement (congregational chanting and glorifying of the name of the Lord) even the wild animals can live in peace and friendship, and what to speak of men who are supposed to be civilized. No man in the world will refuse to join the <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement. Nor is the Lord’s <i>saṅkīrtana</i> movement restricted to any caste, creed, color or species. Here is direct evidence of His great mission: He allowed even the wild animals to partake in His great movement.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13320" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>On His way back from Vṛndāvana He first came to Prayāga, where He met Rūpa Gosvāmī along with his younger brother, Anupama. Then He came down to Benares (Vārāṇasī). For two months, He instructed Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī in the transcendental science. The instruction to Sanātana Gosvāmī is in itself a long narration, and full presentation of the instruction will not be possible here. The main ideas are given as follows.</p></div>

He decided to join with the Lord and thus retired from the service. On His way back from Vṛndāvana, when He reached Vārāṇasī, the Lord became the guest of Śrī Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara, assisted by a Mahārāṣṭra <i>brāhmaṇa. - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ.</span></i> At that time Vārāṇasī was headed by a great <i>sannyāsī - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี</span></i> of the Māyāvāda school named Śrīpāda Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. When the Lord was at Vārāṇasī, the people in general became more attracted to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu on account of His mass <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement. Wherever He visited, especially the Viśvanātha temple, thousands of pilgrims would follow Him. Some were attracted by His bodily features, and others were attracted by His melodious songs glorifying the Lord.</p></div>

Vārāṇasī is still overflooded with many Māyāvādī <i>sannyāsīs. - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสีสฺ.</span></i> Some people who saw the Lord in His <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> party considered Him to be actually Nārāyaṇa, and this report reached the camp of the great <i>sannyāsī</i> Prakāśānanda.</p></div>
                    

                        <div id="bb13323" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In India there is always a kind of spiritual rivalry between the Māyāvāda and <i>Bhāgavata - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควต</span></i> schools, and thus when the news of the Lord reached Prakāśānanda he knew that the Lord was a Vaiṣṇava <i>sannyāsī, - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี,</span></i> and therefore he minimized the value of the Lord before those who brought him the news. He deprecated the activities of the Lord because of His preaching the <i>saṅkīrtana - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน</span></i> movement, which was in his opinion nothing but religious sentiment. Prakāśānanda was a profound student of the Vedānta, and he advised his followers to give attention to the Vedānta and not to indulge in <i>saṅkīrtana. - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน.</span></i></p></div>

The name Kṛṣṇa and the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa are identical. There is no difference in the absolute realm between the name, form or person of the Absolute Truth because in the absolute realm everything is transcendental bliss. There is no difference between the body and the soul for the Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Thus He is different from the living entity, who is always different from his outward body. Because of Kṛṣṇa’s transcendental position, it is very difficult for a layman to actually know the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, His holy name and fame, etc. His name, fame, form and pastimes all are one and the same transcendental identity, and they are not knowable by the exercise of the material senses.</p></div>
