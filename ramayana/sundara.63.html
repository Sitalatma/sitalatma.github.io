Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Dadhimukha comes to Sugreeva and reports that Madhuvana, the grove abounding in honey, 
has been damaged by monkeys headed by Angada and Hanuma. When Lakshmana in the vicinity enquires Sugreeva 
about the matter, Sugreeva says that by hearing about the jubilation of the monkeys, it can be concluded 
that Seetha has been traced out. Assuaging Dadhimukha, Sugreeva asks him to send without delay, Hanuma, 
Angada and others to him, so as to hear about their efforts in tracing out Seetha.</p>
