Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Angada kills Kampana and severely injures Shonitaksha, the demons in battle. Angada, along with ṃainda and Dvivida the monkey-warriors
encounter Shonitaksha, Yupaksha and Prajangha. Angada kills Prajangha. Shonitaksha dies in the hands of Dvivida and Youpaksha at the hands of ṃainda.
When Kumbha throws down Angada in the battle-field, Rama sends some more monkey-chiefs headed by Jambavan. Sugreeva, with his thunderbolt-like fist,
strikes Kumbha with a heavy blow and kills him.</p>
