			<em>yojana </em>is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8

			tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1
			<em>aratni</em> -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one <em>danDa, dhanuṣ</em> - bow height 
			- 6 ft ; 10 danDa-s = 1 <em>rajju</em> 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 <em>paridesha</em> 
			- 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanuṣ-s = one <em>krosha</em> , and also called <em>goraṭa</em> 
			- 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 <em>yojana</em> - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles. 
			But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries 
			say that one yojana is 5 miles. But traditionally it is held as 10 miles. ṃore 
			info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shāstra of Kautilya - a republication

			Dasharatha in his youth, when he was on a hunting spree, killed the son of a hermit

			mistook that sound to be a tiger&#39;s grumble and swung his arrow that way, killing 
			the boy. Thereby the father of the boy being a sage of eminence, cursed Dasharatha 
			to die lamenting for his son, which happens after the exile of Rama. Perhaps the 
			sonic-archery may thus have been banned in Ayodhya, lest such sad incidents would 
			have recurred.</p>
