<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Sage Valmiki goes to River Tamasa for a bath and sees a couple of birds, of which a hunter 
kills one. Valmiki unintentionally utters a poem, which is rich in grammar and new in metre, 
of which he is very much confused as to why such a poem has come from his tongue. Brahma, 
the presiding deity of letters appears and ordains Valmiki to author Ramayana, excellent epic 
of Rama, for which purpose alone he gave such divine meter and grammar to him.</p>

		too shall have heart that can outpour that mood. So when Valmiki is at the river banks, Rama, say 
		Vishnu, came in the guise of a tribal, as with other mythological episodes like <em>kirātārjunīya</em> 
		etc., to test the capability of Valmiki in narrating pathos, and killed one bird. Valmiki reacted 
		immediately and Vishnu&#39;s test is complete. But in exciting the mood of such holy sage, Vishnu / Rama

have four faces, each representing one Veda, where Vedas are four in number. He is the creator 
of worlds, while Vishnu maintains them, and Shiva dissolute them. The concert of Brahma is 
Saraswati, the presiding deity of speech, who was earlier requested by Brahma to be on the
