chapter/Sarga 42<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Sept 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p class="txt">
			Bhageeratha&#39;s effort for bringing Ganga to earth is fulfilled. Amshuman 
			and his son Dileepa could not make any effort to bring the divine river 
			to earth. But Bhageeratha, the son of Dileepa, staunch at heart tries 
			earnestly to get her onto earth. Brahma agreeing for this descent of 
			Ganga designates lord Shiva to bear the burden of the onrush of Ganga, 
			because the earth cannot sustain it.</p>
