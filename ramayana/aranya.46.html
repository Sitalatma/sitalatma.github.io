<h3>chapter [Sarga] 46<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana praises Seetha's beauty by extolling every limb of hers, though he enters like a Brahman sanyāsi, a friar. He indulges in a
most untoward laudation that is unbefitting for a saintly and elderly almsman. Unable to refute him, because he is in such a pious garb, she had to
invite him as an untimely guest.</p>

&#39;sacred thread, three-shafts, saffron clothing, deerskin, handy water vessel, grass-mat, loin-cloth, 
girdle-cloth... by these he will be known as a real sanyasi &#39;Hindu sanyāsi.&#39; Out of all these items, 
the shafts make a difference. Vaishnavaite sanyāsi-s handle three shafts tied into one, and the three 
are symbolic to cit, acit, īshvara &#39;animate, inanimate, and lord...&#39; and on this ṃanu says
<em>vāk daṇDaḥ

the word <em>daṇDa</em> means &#39;repressing, suppression, control...&#39; thus a sanyāsi has to control his &#39;speech, 
mind, and body... by that alone he is renowned as sanyasi... ṃanu. As such, Ravana is in the getup of 
an unmistakable Brahman sanyāsi, with an unbridled tongue.</p>

<div id="btn7" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Did she recognise Ravana as a pseudo-Brahman or not... is the doubt raised by this verse, because 
different texts use different compounds <em>apāya a darshanam.... upāya a darshanam </em>etc. It 
is concluded that she, for sure, identified him as a pseudo-Brahman, because she has seen many such
<em>sanyasi</em>-s while she was in ṃithila. Hence she is said here as <em>ṃaithili </em>because she 
hails from ṃithila and her father&#39;s court was full with these <em>sanyasi-s, yati-s, parivrājaka-s.
</em>Then it is questioned as to why she invited him, though recognised him as a pseudo-Brahman. For 
this Govindaraja says: <em>kāṣāya daṇDa mātreṇa yatiḥ 
pūjyo na samshayaḥ | </em>&#39;By spotting the saffron robe alone, a <em>sanyasi </em>is venerable...&#39;

his sanyāsi-hood...&#39; Ravana is indulged in <em>strī kathā </em>in the whole of this chapter, in 
admiring at her lips, breasts, thighs etc., and no usual <em>swasti vacana, shubha āshīs </em>
&#39;blessings...&#39; are uttered by him and thus Seetha could discern him to be a pseudo-<em> sanyasi.

</p>

<div id="btn9" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Though knowing him as such, why should she revere him at all, is another question. What else she 
could do as his appearance itself is <em>uddveṣṭum a+shakyam </em>&#39;irrefutable appearance of a 
Brahman <em>sanyasi</em>...&#39; hence, somehow some time is to be gained until the arrival of Rama or 
Lakshmana. Otherwise, this pseudo-<em>sanyasi</em> may cause any pseudo-problem that she cannot 
solve. For this, the reply is at the word in the last verse <em>haritam dadarsha... </em>&#39;only 
greenery is seen by her not Rama nor Lakshmana...&#39; And in the next verse itself she is addressing 
him as a &quot;Brahman...&#39; but not with the titles like<em> sanyasi or yatīshvara, paramahamsa, 
parivrājaka </em>etc. A Brahman alone is eligible to take up <em>sanyāsa </em>
&#39;Hindu-sanyāsi-hood...&#39; not Kshatriya or others. Hence, she concluded him to be Brahman. When once 
the sanyāsi-hood is taken he is no more a Brahman and his bodily being neutralises in the Absolute, 
and such a sanyāsi shall drag on his body, without comfortable bodily needs, until his natural 
death. But Seetha is addressing him contrary to his stance.</p>
