<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful ṃajesties</h3>
<h3>chapter / sarga 36<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Sept 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Shiva on his marriage with Uma is in the conjugal bliss for a long period due to 
his yogic powers. Fearing the result of that prolonged activity all gods prey for 
the cessation of it because none in any world can carry that offspring. Shiva accepting 
that request asks them where to discharge the sperm that has already stirred up. 
Gods indicate the earth as the taker. Shiva accordingly inundates the earth with 
his fluid. Then the Fire-god is dispatched to consolidate that into a reed forest 
called <font color="#B3003A">sharavaṇa</font> . Goddess Uma ireful at the prevention 
of begetting a son, now curses&nbsp; gods and earth to be childless.</p>

bestow grace.&#39; [1-36-8b, 9]</p>

<p class="comment">
This prolonged act of copulation is an act of yoga called <em>mahā maithuna.</em> 
The Shaktaite Tantriks who practise <em>panca ma kāra : madya, māmsa, matsya, 
mudra, maithuna</em> &#39;liquor&#39; &#39;mutton&#39; &#39;fish&#39; &#39;postures&#39; [loosely: callisthenics] 
and &#39;copulation&#39; make use of these things. In these practises, the yogis use <em>
mudra-s</em> &#39;posture&#39; &#39;callisthenics&#39; at the time of copulation even, so that there 
will be no ejaculation for a longer period. This is their &#39;Five-element theory...&#39;</p>

of worlds with the efflux of the unmanageable potence of yours .&#39; So said gods to 
Shiva. [1-36-10, 11]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>tejas</em> also means semen, or offspring, besides resplendence <em>
tejaḥ parākrame prāṇe varcas arciṣhi retasi - ratnamāla</em> thus the prospective 
offspring through ejaculation is the problem here, because Kumara, or, Skanda takes 
birth with all the irrepressible effulgence of Shiva, plus his own.</p>

<p class="comment">
Thus the celestials do not directly breed. They take the agency of humans or other 
mortals to bring forth their offspring as in the case of the monkey race, and ṃenaka, 
and as in the case of Vishvamitra giving birth to Shakuntala, who in her turn gave 
birth to Bharata, so on.</p>

<p class="comment">
The sin of earth to bear the curse of Uma Devi is to accept the semen of Shiva on 
her surface. The appearance of earth will not be in one kind or quality for it has 
lands and oceans, deserts and forests, volcanoes and mountains, ice and humidity, 
etc. Further, the earth is the official wife to numerous kings. The earth is also 
cursed to not to have the delight of her children. The earth has Naraka, the demon, 
and Seetha as her children. But these two are not begotten through any seminal contact 
by earth, and further, for earth it is as good as not having these two as her children, 
for such is the plight of these two so-called children of earth on earth. After 
many tumults in her life, even Seetha asks her mother on earth, i.e., mother earth 
herself, to take her back into her womb.</p>

Here some say the mountain on which Shiva settled for ascesis as <em>himavat prabhava</em> 
giving it a full name, like ṃt. Kailash or Kanchanjunga etc. If any such mountain 
peak is named and available in mythologies or in Himalayas, this needs a revision.</p>
