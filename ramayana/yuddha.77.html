<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seeing Kumbha his brother killed in battle, the enraged Nikumbha with an iron club as 
his weapon roars and faces the battle. Hanuma directly attacks Nikumbha, by striking his fist forcibly 
on Nikumbha&#39;s breast. Unmoved by that blow, Nikumbha lifts Hanuma, off the ground. Hanuma in retaliation 
frees himself and throws down Nikumbha on the ground. Hanuma descends on Nikumbha, pounds his chest 
with his fist, catches his head and tears it off. Thus, Nikumbha dies at the hands of Hanuma.</p>
