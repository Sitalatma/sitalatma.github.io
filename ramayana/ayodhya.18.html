<h3>Book II : Ayodhya Kanda - Book Of Ayodhya</h3>
<h3>chapter[Sarga] 18<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">In this chapter Rama arrives at the king's presence. Seeing King disturbed, Rama becomes grieved and wants to know the cause of king's
perturbance. Queen Kaikeyi describes to Rama about the boons that Dasaratha had given earlier and also her wishes of coronating Bharatha instead of
Rama and sending Rama to Dandaka forest. On listening to these harsh words of Kaikeyi, Rama did not become sorrowful, but Dasaratha was very much
disturbed.</p>
