<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful ṃajesties</h3>
<h3>chapter / sarga 51<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Sept 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Enquiring about his father Gautama&#39;s reuniting with his mother Ahalya, Sage Shatānanda relates the 
legend of Vishvamitra. Shatānanda greets Rama for his adherence to the rectitude of Vishvamitra, which 
Vishvamitra gained through a series of self-important exploits, when he was a great king at one time. 
Shatānanda finds worth in informing the biography of Vishvamitra to Rama, because too much of overbearing 
of kings, as has been done by Vishvamitra, will be unbecoming for kings.</p>

<p class="comment">
Renuka is the mother of Parashu Rama, another human incarnation of Vishnu as a Brahmin to struggle with 
the erring Kshatriya kings of an earlier era. Renuka&#39;s husband is Sage Jamadagni, the descendent of 
Bhrigu or also called as Bhārgava and on certain occasion, Jamadagi, orders his son Parashu Rama to 
behead her, i.e., Renuka, Parashu Rama&#39;s own mother and Parashu Rama unhesitatingly carries out his 
father&#39;s orders. Thus, Parashu Rama is called Bhārgava Rama, with an axe as his unsurpassed weapon. 
This Parashu Rama confronts Rama of Ramayana after Seetha&#39;s marriage.</p>

be undefeatable, thus hail to thee! [1-51-13]</p>

<p class="comment">
This statement of Sage Shatānanda shall remind us the utterances of Vishvamitra in Dasharatha&#39;s court 
at 1-19-14: <em>aham vedmi mahātmānam rāmam...</em> &#39;I know this great soul Rama, the virtue valiant, 
even Vashishta and also these saints who are here...&#39; So also, Shatānanda being the son of Ahalya and 
Gautama perceived who this Rama is. Further, when such and such a sage spearheads Rama, Rama ought to 
know something about the background of his steersman, namely Vishvamitra, basing on which Rama can learn 
his own lessons. As such, next few chapters are catered to the legend of Vishvamitra through Shatānanda.</p>

<p class="comment">
If the text &#39;you already know him...&#39; is adopted there will be nothing left to Shatānanda to say more. 
Hence, the meaning is said on taking <em>vedmya</em> &#39;you should know some more...&#39; would be better. 
Because Vishvamitra is a <em>parama hita sandhāyaka</em> &#39;a do-gooder for universal peace&#39; as indicated
