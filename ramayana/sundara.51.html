<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 51<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Hanuma narrates the story of Rama, who on command from his father, went on exile to Dandaka 
forest along with Seetha, who was later borne away by Ravana through the sky over Rishyamuka mountain. 
Hanuma adds that Rama, while searching for Seetha at ṃount Rishyamuka, happened to meet Sugreeva and 
made friendship with him. Hanuma also tells the story about Rama installing Sugreeva in the throne, 
after killing Vali and about Sugreeva promising Rama to get Seetha searched. Celebrating the glory of 
Rama, Hanuma points out to Ravana that if he wished to survive he should give back Seetha to Rama and 
that he should be prepared for the worst if on the other hand he refuses to do so.</p>
