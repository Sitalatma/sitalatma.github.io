<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Rama gives ring to Hanuma as a memorabilia enabling Seetha to recognise Hanuma without dismay. Sugreeva holds 
Hanuma&#39;s capabilities very high and reposes full confidence in him for locating Seetha. On seeing Sugreeva assigning 
the task to Hanuma, Rama perceives that Hanuma alone can achieve results and thus hands over his ring to Hanuma. 
Then Hanuma starts on the expedition with others.</p>

Rama&#39;s Ring</p>


<div id="btn3" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">The ring of Rama assumes a great importance in the course of Ramayana. 
Though Valmiki says nothing extraordinary, commentators attach many good reasons and attributes to this episode. 
After the two foots of verse 4-4-12 the following foot is traditionally read, in affection.</p>

<p class="Itrṣloka">suvarṇasya su varṇasya su-varnasya a~Ngulīyakam</p>


<div id="btn4" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">That is to say <em>suvarṇasya</em> &#39;golden ring...&#39;
<em>su varṇasya</em> &#39;greatly glittering...&#39; <em>su-varṇasya</em> &#39;good 
lettered...&#39; &#39;That ring is golden, that too highly glittering, [rather high in carats, maybe 48 carats,] and has 
very good letters on it...&#39; That ring has one jewel on upper side and two jewels below that. The upper jewel has 
a carving of the letter <em>shri</em> and lower two <em>rā, ma...</em> 
so goes the tradition.</p>


<div id="btn5" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">When Rama abdicated everything and no other jewellery is evident on his 
body, though his bow and arrows have golden finishing, then why this lone ring is still there with him - is the 
debatable question. This indicates the custom of exchanging rings in marriage. This is the ring got prepared by 
Seetha in her kingdom ṃithila and she herself put it on Rama&#39;s finger in their marriage as
<em>vara varaṇa</em> &#39;selecting the wooer...&#39; When Hanuma gives this ring to Seetha in Sundara 
Kanda the reaction of Seetha is: <em>gṛihītvā prekṣhamāṇā sā bhartṛi kara vibhūṣhaṇam | </em>&#39;on taking the adornment of her husband&#39;s hand 
she looked at it...&#39; at 5-36-4. </p>

<div id="btn6" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">This ring to men is almost like the <em>mangala sūtra</em> 
&#39;the sacred marriage-time pendant of Hindu ladies. Thus, none can ask a man to remove his wedding ring as 
long as his wife is alive and attached.</p>


<div id="btn7" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">Next, &#39;in giving such ring to Hanuma, bypassing the troop leader Angada, 
Rama slighted the imperial protocol...&#39; and &#39;Sugreeva being a king why eulogise Hanuma this much, a simple minister? 
Is it to deify Hanuma? This is another objection. For this Dharmākūtam gives a vivid and extensive commentary, 
saying it is not at all a violation of protocol. The objection is:
</p>

<div id="btn8" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
<em>na anvatra yuvarāje bala adhyakṣhe a~Ngade sati hanumataḥ svatantratayā puraskāraḥ abijñāna pradanādikam 
ca anucitam-</em>&#39;when prince regent Angada is there, entrusting some work to Hanuma independently, that too after 
eulogising him, is unbefitting...&#39; This is countered by the commentator saying that: </p>

<div id="btn9" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
<em>evam ca avishvasanīyam angadam apahāya vishvasanīyo hanumati bishṣhyua puraskārādikam yuktam eva |-</em>&#39;still 
Angada has not gained the confidence of the king, though he is anointed as prince regent, thus entrusting a piece 
of work to Hanuma by Sugreeva is reasonable...&#39; Then the counter-question is &#39;why Angada is anointed as prince 
regent, at all...&#39; for this it is said: </p>

<div id="btn10" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
<em>tathā ca angadasya jñātitvāt avishvasanīyatvāt aparityāgena rakṣhaṇīyatvādvinītam vidhāya yauva rājye 
abhiṣhecanīyatvāt ca rakṣhaṇa yauvarājya abhiṣhecana kārya niyojanādikam - mantiṇaḥ ca hanumataḥ sakala kāryeṣhu 
vishvasanīyasya svātnatreṇa puraskārādikam yuktam eva | </em>&#39;a blood relation is to be anointed as a prince 
regent to look after the affairs of the kingdom, and here too, Angada is nominated as the troop leader of the 
expedition to look after the safety of this particular troop, and it does not preclude the king to entrust certain 
work to some of his true believable adherents...&#39; This being so, Angada also expresses his resentment against 
Sugreeva and openly criticises Sugreeva at the end of this canto on similar lines, when they are unable to leap 
the ocean.</p>
