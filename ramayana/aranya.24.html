<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama perceives good omens of victory, but to safeguard Seetha he sends her away with Lakshmana to take 
shelter in a mountain&#39;s cave till the war is over. Then he adopts a furious nature to annihilate demons. 
Gods and divinities watch from heavens as to how a war can occur between one against fourteen thousand 
demons.</p>

The meaning can otherwise be rendered as: &#39;If any misgivings are caused by an imminent danger a well-wisher

= along with, ṣeetha; <em>durgām guhām samāshrayat</em> = unreachable, in cave, took shelter.</p>

<p class="tat">
When Rama said to him that way, Lakshmana picked up his bow and arrows, and together with Seetha he 
took shelter in an unreachable cave. [3-24-15]</p>

<p class="comment">
This episode of sending away Seetha and Lakshmana has got three reasons in the complex of She-He-ṃe. 
1] One is that this Seetha is to be sent away from that prospective battlefield, because Seetha is untrained 
for warfare like Rama&#39;s third mother Kaikeyi. Secondly, whenever Seetha is present we see no killings 
or slayings in Ramayana, because she, as Goddess Lakshmi, condones any sinner and accords salvation. 
As such, there may be a probability of not only hindering war, but there may be her blessing to every 
demon with a free passage to heaven, of which Rama becomes a helpless onlooker. 2] Second reason is 
that this Lakshmana is intolerant of any assault on his brother or sister-in-law and colloids head-on 
with the aggressors, which may lead Lakshmana up to Lanka to confront even Ravana. That being the snakily 
aggressive nature of Lakshmana, Rama bids him to go away before any happening, or any further dialogue 
is given to Lakshmana. 3] Third is that Rama is the first one to promise the sages and saints to eradicate 
demons for himself, for which Seetha nags him not to wage a causeless war. Therefore, if Rama is going 
to hide in any cave camouflaged by trees along with Seetha, and Lakshmana goes on warring, the very 
character of Rama is at stake. Thus, as promised to sages and saints Rama alone wanted to trigger off 
the elimination process of demons. That is why Rama breathes fresh air saying &quot;good riddance&quot; in next 
verse.</p>

Rama has no built-in feature of ire or wrath. He has to whip it up at times to show divine fury as a 
mask. From the start Vishnu is changing get-ups and when ṃilky Ocean was churned, He became ṃohini, 
and from then on his role-play is continuous in al the incarnations. As said in Bala Kanda 1-1-18:
<em>kālāgni sadṛishaḥ krodhe</em> &#39;resembles like fierce fire in anger...&#39; thus it is a resemblance, 
not an actuality, even that is unbearable for a glance.

<p class="comment">
The metaphor of cloud-clusters with the demons is to explain that the clouds will evaporate on the advent 
of fire-like sun at his dawn or rising of Rama to war. The night-walking demons have their powers increased 
in evening times and dwindled in morning. Thus their fire-like armours will cease to exist when the 
real Sun&#39;s fire [or fire of Rama&#39;s arrows] starts to flame, their bows cease to exits if the rainbow-giver 
comes in, and their flagging ensigns will cease with the ensigncy of raising sun in sky, and ill becomes
