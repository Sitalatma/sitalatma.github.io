<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 69<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">As Ravana is lamenting over the death of Kumbhakarna, Trishira (one of Ravana's sons) consoles him and says that he will go to the
battle-field and kill Rama. Hearing the words of Trishira, Ravana's other sons (Devantaka, Narantaka and Atikaya) also come forward to join the
fight. Then Ravana sends all them to the battle. He also sends ṃahodara and ṃahaparshva, his brothers to guard his sons. ṃighty demons accompany
them. The demons release arrows towards the monkeys, who see the demons coming in elephants, horses and chariots. The monkeys take huge rocks and
trees to fight with the demons. Seeing several demons being killed in battle, Narantaka enters the field with his javelin and kills several monkeys.
ṃeanwhile, those monkeys who were thrown down unconscious by Kumbhakarna earlier regain their consciousness and approach Sugreeva for help. Then,
Sugreeva sends Angada for the fight. Narantaka hurls his javelin towards Angada's chest, but the javelin breaks and falls down. Angada strikes
Narantaka's horse with his hand and the horse falls down dead. Then, Angada and Narantaka exchange the blows of their fists on each other in battle
and finally, Narantaka dies.</p>
