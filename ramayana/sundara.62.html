<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 62<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">The monkeys enter ṃadhuvana and partake the honey in plenty, as permitted by Hanuma and 
Angada. Singing and dancing as if in a drunken state, the monkeys were obstructed by those guarding 
the grove. The terrific monkeys warded off the guards, nay, they even dragged them by their knees and 
tossed them up in the air. The guards then went to Dadhimukha, the chief of the garden-guards and complained 
him of the matter. Dadhimukha along with his followers appears on the scene and invade the monkeys with 
trees and rocks. Angada thrashed Dadhimukha with his arms and made him fall on the ground. Dadhimukha 
along with his followers then proceed to Kishkindha to report the matter to him. Dadhimukha bows down 
and touches Sugreeva&#39;s feet as a mark of salutation.</p>
