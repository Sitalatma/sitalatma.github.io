<p class="comment">
There is a lot of commentary from the viewpoint of astrology regarding these stars and days of this marriage. Some have 
said that <em>uttare divase</em> &#39;on best day...&#39; <em>phalguni= puurva phalguni</em> &#39;pre-Phalguni... on the best day under 
pre-Phalguni star...&#39; which usually does not happen, but it is also said to be correct by Maheshvara Tiirtha, as the Moon 
will be in the 12th house at that time, so the marriage is agreeable...&#39; However the stars for best results of marriages 
are: <em>rohiNii mR^igashiirShyaNi

The kind deed done by the two sages, Vishvamitra and Vashishta, is fetching right husbands for his daughters, and for his

<p class="comment">
The &#39;unnecessarily&#39; repeated word &#39;quartet&#39; refers to <em>dharma</em> where its manifestation is with four horns, <em>catvaarii 
shR^ingaa, trayo asya paadaa, dve shiirSe...</em> &#39;dharma&#39;s horns is a quartet, three are its feet, two are its heads...&#39; 
so on. When read together with 23, 24 verses, the bullish Dasharatha is said to have the quartet of bullhorn like sons, 
who are being readied to administer <em>dharma</em> in the world.</p>
