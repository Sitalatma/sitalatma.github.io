<h1><a href="index.html">Valmiki Ramayana</a></h1>
<h2>Bala kanda</h2>








	<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - Book Of Youthful Majesties<br>Chapter [Sarga] 1<br>
		Introduction</h3>
		
		<p>
		Divine sage Narada arrives at the hermitage of Sage Valmiki in order to enlighten him and keep him informed 
		of his duty to author the epic poem Ramayana. In the dialogue between these two sages, Valmiki elicits 
		from Narada about most virtuous person on earth, namely Rama. In this opening chapter, while eulogizing 
		Rama Narada gives an outline of Ramayana, truly highlighting those aspects that are the keynotes in 
		this epic, like virtuosity, generosity, morality, chastity and the like.</p>
		
		<p>
		Valmiki Ramayana is said to have been composed basing on each of the twenty-four letters of Gayatri 
		Hymn, and a thousand verses are arranged into one book under the caption of each letter. Though that 
		classification, or dividing verses into thousand chapters is unavailable now, the twenty-four verses 
		identified with the 24 letters of Gayatri hymn, called as Gayatri Ramayana, is available and it is given 
		in the endnote of this page. In tune with the scheme of Gayatri, Ramayana starts the first verse with 
		letter <em>ta</em> an auspicious letter.</p>

<p class="comment">
Valmiki wanted to know about that man - a man with godly qualities. Valmiki&#39;s thinking aloud, 
about the qualities of his prospective hero of this epic, is the very opening questions put 
to an Omniscient Sage Narada. Both the sages know of Rama and his deeds. Even then Valmiki 
asks Narada, &quot;who is that man with godly qualities?&#39; If Narada tells that Rama is Vishnu Himself, 
there is nothing left for Valmiki to compose his epic, because there are numerous mythologies, 
puraaNa-s, that have already adored God Vishnu. If Narada tells that Rama is so-and-so king, 
again Valmiki need not attempt to author about some king, however great that king might be. 
</p>

<p class="comment">
The attributes of the hero of Ramayana, as required by Valmiki, are 16; sixteen in number.<span class="smRS">&nbsp; </span><em>1

These sixteen attributes are attributed to the sixteen phases of the Full Moon, and Valmiki 
is about to picture Rama to be as pleasant as a full-moon.</p>

Narada came hither to impart the legend of Rama, as Brahma already imparted the same to him,

<p class="comment">
For the attributes explained by Narada there are some Vedanta imports. From <em>niya aatma</em> 
to <em>vashii</em> these are the attributes of the Supreme Being, Absolute of Brahman. <em>
swaruupa nirupaka lakshNaaH</em> . This <em>niyata aatmaa</em> is &#39;immutable Absolute, this 
is the postulate of any Upanishad: <em>ya aatmaa apahata paapmaa virajo vimR^ityur vishoko...</em> 
8-7-1, Chaandoj~na Upanishad. <em>mahaa viiryaH = acintya vividha vicitra shaktivataH</em> 
Absolute is Omnicompetent <em>paraa asya shaktiH vividhaa iva shruuyate svaabhaavikii j~naana 
bala kriyaa ca</em> 6-8, Shwetaashvatara Upanishad. The word <em>dyutimaan</em> is for the 
attribute of Self-Resplendent Absolute, or, Resplendence of Consciousness. <em>tam eva bhaantam 
anubhaati sarvam tasya bhaasaa sarvam idam bhaati</em> 2-11, Mundaka Upanishad. And the
<em>dhR^ithimaan</em> is Sublime Bliss, according to Vyjanti <em>dhR^itiH tu tuSTiH santoSaH</em> 
and as said in <em>aanando brahama - aanandaat eva khalu imaani bhuutaani jaayante</em> 6, 
Taittariiya Upanishad. Next, <em>vashii</em> Absolute is the Omnipotent on the entire Universe.
<em>eko vahii sarva bhuuta antaraatmaa</em> 2-5-12, Katha Upanishad and <em>sarvasya vashii 
sarvasya iishaanaH</em> and the like. The rest of the attributes of Rama as said by Narada 
are identifiable with the causative factors of that Absolute in Creation, and the process 
of Creation is the self-expression of the Absolute.</p>

				The word रक्षिता is the Nominative Singular of रक्षितृ and means Protector. Please note that prajaapatiH can be applied to Vedic Gods as well as to Lord Brahma, Lord Vishnu and Lord Maheswara.

<p class="comment">
These are the ancillary subjects of Vedas called <em>anga</em> part and <em>upa anga</em> 
sub-part. The main parts of Veda-s are <em>siksha</em> ritual rigor <em>vyakarana</em> grammar
<em>chandas</em> prosody <em>jyotish</em> astroloj~n <em>nirukta</em> recital rules <em>kalpa</em> 
procedure rules. This apart, the <em>dhanur veda</em> science of archery, itself is treated 
as &#39;an exclusive Veda taught to warriors...&#39; The <em>danur Veda</em> is not to be construed 
as simple bow and arrow and &#39;shooting the target&#39; education. It is a &#39;scripture on missiles&#39; 
that existed in those ages.</p>

<p class="comment">
Down the memory lane, O. A.Vijayan, the eminent Indian journalist has reflected in The Illustrated 
Weekly of India, that the Soviet scholar Dr. A. A. Gorbovsky said in his article with heading
<font color="#B3003A">Ancient India may have had N-arms</font> , in the Statesman, with dateline 
Moscow, Sept. 8, 1986. Among other things, the scientist observes by the stanzas that describe 
the disaster caused by such <em>astra-s,</em> now loosely termed as a well crafted bow and 
sky rocketing arrows, as below:</p>

<p class="comment">
<em>&#39;A blazing shaft which possessed all the effulgence of smokeless fire 
was let off... all directions were enveloped by darkness... the very elements seemed to be 
perturbed... the sun seemed to turn... the universe, scorched with heat, seemed to be in fever... 
the survivors lost their hair and nails... for years the sun and sky remained shrouded with 
clouds...&#39;</em></p>

<p class="comment">
Thus the narration goes on. This is the account of <em>Brahma astra,</em> as in Maha Bharata, 
the other Epic of India. Thus the Dhanur Veda may be taken as the canon of missile sciences, 
which fortunately has not been handed over to the successive generations, lest everything 
would have been annihilated by now. In Ramayana too, which is much earlier to Mahabharata, 
there are elaborate accounts of such <em>astra-s</em> in the coming chapters. Sage Vishvamitra, 
who is well-versed in warfare, gives many such weapons to Rama. For now, these bow and arrow 
references may not be taken as those of Robin Hood.</p>

<p class="comment">
At times Rama is said to be &#39;the son of Kausalya...&#39; than the son Dasharatha, because the 
word Kausalya does not signify his mother alone, the daughter of King of Kosala, but it has 
meanings like <em>kshema, kushala, saamarthya, puNya, nipuNatva</em> &#39;safeness, soundness, 
capability, merit, expertise...&#39; and this also signifies Queen Kausalya&#39;s worshipping of Vishnu. 
When dynasty, valour, braveness etc., are said, Rama&#39;s name will be attached with Dasharatha. 
An ocean is not a bottomless one but an unfathomable one. So also Rama&#39;s heart has a reachable 
bottom, where pearls, gems, and other treasures of virtues are abounding, and it can be reached 
with a heartily approach. For a hard-hearted one Rama&#39;s heart becomes an unfathomable abyss 
and he will get lost in it.&nbsp; <em>girayoH varSha dhaaraabhir haryamaanaa 
na vivyadhuH | abhibhuuya maanaa vyasanaiH yathaa adhokShaja cetasaa ||</em>&nbsp; &#39;true 
devotees do not get hassled though subjected to many problems, for they place their faith 
in the Supreme. Equally, mountains are unshaken though battered by storms or lightings...&#39; 
So, like a mountain he is unalterable and constant for a true devotee. An icy-mountain is 
meltable by scorching sun, thus Rama also melts down when his adherents are scorched with 
their problems.</p>

Here the &#39;valour&#39; is to cause harm to enemy, while remaining himself unharmed... <em>svasya 
a-vikaara eva parasya vikaara aapadanam</em> Rama Tilaka. &#39;Though Rama is Vishnu, but by nature 
of his incarnation as human, he is different from Vishnu <em>upaadhi bheda...</em> Hence Vishnu 
has become another entity than Rama... Or, his valour is selfsame to Vishnu&#39;s valour because 
he is selfsame Vishnu...&#39; Govindaraja. &#39;As there is none other in similitude, he is compared 
Vishnu, insofar as valour is concerned...&#39; Maheshvara Tiirtha. Earth personally does not grieve

Readers may find an inordinate use of ellipses in translation of the epic. But they are &#39;a 
must.&#39; Pt. Satya Vrat, the author of <font color="#B3003A">Ramayana - A Linguistic Study</font> 
says: &quot;Ellipsis is the peculiarity of the style of the older works like Ramayana... their 
writings, as they stood, yielded incomplete sense which has to be supplemented by <em>adhyaadhaara</em>, 
viz., supply of words, that would fit in the context... Indeed, in most cases the ellipsis 
could be readily understood and would suggest the word or words that would make it up...&#39; 
We therefore request the readers to go by the meaning of the context, than by the order of 
words, for there is a saying... <em>paaTha krame artha kramo baliiyaH...</em> So, this <em>
adhyaadhaara</em>, supply of words, may not be that faithful while rendering from Sanskrit 
to English.</p>

	Here <em>deva maaya</em> refers to many concepts. Vaishnavaite tenets tell that the word
	<em>deva</em> is ascribable only to Vishnu, but not to other gods. Thus, this is <em>Vishnu 
	maya</em>, when He assumed an extraordinary female form called Mohini, when distributing
	<em>amR^ita</em>, the divine elixir, to gods and demons. Next is the form of Tilottama, a 
	divine beauty to hoodwink demons called Sunda and Upasunda. The other is Vishnu&#39;s <em>liilaa 
	shakti</em>, which is divinely fascinating. Yet another is grammatical connotation, <em>maa 
	yaa</em> where, <em>maa</em>= Goddess Lakshmi; <em>yaa</em>= who that is; meaning <em>yaa 
	siitaa saa maa</em>= &#39;who is Goddess Lakshmi... She is Seetha...&#39; and this results in the 
	saying: <em>ati ruupavatii siitaa... ati muurkhaH cha raavaNa</em> &#39;While Seetha is extraordinarily 
	beautiful, Ravana is exceedingly stupid...</p>
	
<p class="comment">
The deities have their wives always with them. Chandra, the Moon has Rohini, a conspicuous 
star, while Surya, Sun has Prabha, Sunshine. Minus these wives, their glow and glitter is 
void. So also, Rama has an inseparable wife. Though Seetha and Lakshmana were not exiled, 
they followed Rama out of concept of &#39;togetherness...&#39;</p>

		Vali, the elder brother of Sugreeva, is another principle character of Ramayana. He is capable of rendering 
		oblations to gods in the wee hours of a single day in four oceans on four sides of the globe, by his 
		flying from one ocean to the other. He is mightier than Ravana, the chief villain of the epic, and 
		Ravana iwas subdued by Vali&#39;s strength. As a preamble to the incident of eliminating mighty Ravana in

	Vali was able to throw that body, with whole of his foot, only up to two hundred bow-lengths, where the
