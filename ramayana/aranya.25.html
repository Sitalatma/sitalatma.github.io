<h3>chapter [Sarga] 25<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Oct 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
The ambidextrous archery of Rama is established here for the first time. So far, he has been using his 
archery sporadically, and here it is said to have a different dimension. The speed with which he draws 
arrows from quiver, the quickness with which he strings them, and the precision with which he shoots, 
is suggested here, though not explained. Though no apparent divinity is attached to this excercise, 
it suggests a divine expertise of a human.</p>

<p class="tat">
There are fourteen thousand demons against one Rama, and the Divine beings watch this from heavens as 
a sport, without according any miraculous powers to Rama, suggesting that a human has to face any number 
of problems, here fourteen thousand demons, for himself and no divine grace suddenly comes to his help.</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama gives the demons enough time and warning, but as the atrocity is escalating, he uses one gandharva 
missile and many other arrows, which will devastate the entire army of Dushana&#39;s brute force.</p>
