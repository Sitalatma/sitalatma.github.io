<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 50<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Jatāyu confronts Ravana on hearing the wailing of Seetha. He boldly forestalls Ravana and his air-chariot 
in the sky itself, and as an elderly being he reviles Ravana from the viewpoint of righteousness befitting 
to kings, but of no avail. His dilemma is that he cannot take flight to Rama&#39;s place, nor he can forestall 
Ravana until Rama comes. Yet, he persists to affront Ravana.</p>

king of eagles known by the name Jatāyu. [3-50-3, 4a]</p>

<p class="comment">
This self-assured statement of Jatāyu is like this: <em>aham purāṇe dharme sthitaḥ </em>&#39;I abide by 
the <em>sanātana dharama</em>, &#39;The Eternal Virtue...&#39; &#39;belonging to the master and the servant...&#39;

am sheltered by the Everlasting Truth... that Everlasting Truth is made known in <em>satyam jñānam 
anantam brahma... </em>and thus <em>bhagavat ekopāya niṣṭaḥ</em>, &#39;I have a complete dedication unto 
god...&#39; - &#39;I with my unwavering determination am subservient to Him alone, and such as I am, in my presence 
you cannot undertake a deplorable deed, deplorable to that Eternal Virtue or to three worlds...&#39; On 
telling about himself, next he started to tell about his master. Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">
The simile of Indra and Rain-god to Rama is to say that &#39;Rama is a bestower of rains and livelihood 
like Indra, the presiding deity of east, through the Rain-god, the presiding deity of west, unlike you 
who are a pilferer... and he is the preserver of all the worlds... so, you also get persevered by him,

[3-50-7b, 8]</p>

<p class="comment">
If it is asked that a king&#39;s wife is a special entity to be protected, and then other&#39;s wives are less 
fortunate or what? Not so, it is said that the wife of a king is a motherly entity. Other&#39;s wives may 
become sisters or sister-in-laws etc., but a mother is a mother. The difference in dealing with a king&#39;s 
wife and with wife of a commoner is that of a difference between a sinner and a criminal. Either way 
unrighteous it is. The very basic concept of wooing others&#39; wives itself, is both a crime and a sin.

<p class="comment">
Here the word &#39;king&#39; also denotes the god, as ṃanu uses the word &#39;rājā&#39; for Yama, the Terminator yamo 
vaivasvato rājā yaḥ tava eṣa hṛiodi sthitā... For this, Ravana may refute saying, &#39;this Rama may 
be a god of yours... but not mine...&#39; And for this it is countered in saying, devānām ca devatāanām 
ca sāmānyam adhi daivam... &#39;there is no your god or my god, but god is one... to everyone...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Jatāyu is asking for a reversal of Ravana&#39;s mind or course, otherwise misfortune likely to happen to 
him. Further, being a king one shall never do a deplorable and unkingly act. <em>anena loka ninditam

<p class="pratipada">
<em>9. paulastya nandana</em> = oh, Paulastya&#39;s, scion of; <em>shiṣṭāḥ</em> = erudite scholars; <em>
shāstreṣu an āgatam</em> = in scriptures, not, conspicuous; <em>artham vā</em> = prosperity, either;
<em>yadi vā kāmam</em> = or, if, pleasures; <em>dharmam</em> = [or even] probity; <em>rājānam anu</em> 
= kings&#39; [course of action,] by following; <em>vyavasyanti</em> = conduct themselves.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;If the means to gain probity, or prosperities, or even pleasures are inconspicuous in scriptures, oh, 
the scion of Paulastya, then even the erudite scholars will conduct themselves following the king and 
his demeanour. [3-50-9]</p>

<p class="comment">
There is another flex for the rājānam anu as <em>rājānam anu </em>as <em>rājānam iva </em>&#39;like 
king, like subjects...&#39; <em>shiṣṭāḥ </em>&nbsp;&#39;anyone who takes recourse to righteous behaviour...&#39; 
Because the king shall possess an aptitude to go through the scriptures and ascertain what is right 
and what is wrong, then only his subjects will follow likewise. Even if the course of conduct is imperceptible 
in scriptures, a king shall decide the right way, and thus the subjects automatically follow him, in 
the same way... thus, &#39;being a king, yet behaving like a criminal and a sinner, is inapt of you...&#39; 
so said Jatāyu to Ravana. ṃaheshvara Tīrtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
Ravana is the son of Vishravasa who again is the son of Pulastya, the brainchild of Brahma, who are 
all supposed to be the well-read scholars in all scriptures and sciences. Hence, Jatāyu is addressing 
Ravana to remember his scholarship, which is in effrontery with his present behaviour. And the suggestion 
that &#39;protect wives of others persons as you protect your own wife...&#39; is to say that &#39;if somebody from 
your subjects, on following your present path, gains access to your wife ṃandodari, do you tolerate?&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Ruling the kingdom righteously, in itself is a merit that leads that king to heavens. When the kingdom 
itself is acquired unrighteously, and so the oppulence, there is no question of merit or heaven, or 
even an air ticket to that heaven. For such persons, all these are ad hoc luxuries. <em>anena pāpiṣhṭasya

<p class="comment">
The reference to an aircraft that carries Ravana to heaven is not the Pushpaka aircraft, which he already 
grabbed from Kubera. The airports of Pushpaka aircraft are in the mortal worlds and in heavens it can 
land at the best in Indra&#39;s heaven, say paradise. There is no entry for these petty airships into the 
higher realms of Brahma, Vishnu, and ṃaheshvara if piloted by Ravana like demons.</p>

The words <em>kīrti, yashās</em> may look synonymous but have been defined separately. <em>kīrti</em> 
is the fame which arises from acts of valour, etc., while <em>yashas</em> is the fame which arises from 
acts of charity and the like. In another way <em>kīrti</em> is the renown obtained from doing merited 
and socio-economic deeds done through conducting Vedic rituals and the like, and <em>yashas</em> is 
the renown obtained from having riches, wealth, and affluence. Rama Tilaka says that <em>kīrti = deshāntara 
khyāti</em> fame which &#39;spreads in countries beyond one&#39;s own country...&#39; while <em>yashas = sva desha 
khyāati</em> is &#39;the fame confined to one&#39;s own country.&#39; Dr. Satya Vrat is of the opinion that &#39;which 
of the two explanations of the commentator, Rama Tilaka, is acceptable and more reasonable we cannot 
say in our present stage of knowledge... In fact the commentator himself is not sure; one strikes him 
at one time, and another at another place...&#39; Kulluka Bhatt in his commentary on <em>manu dharma shāstra</em> 
says that <em>jīvataḥ khyati rūpam - yashaḥ</em> &#39;fame in living time is <em>yashaḥ</em> and the other
<em>mṛitasya khyāti rūpam - kīrtim</em> &#39;the fame that remains after death is <em>kīrti</em></p>

The Indian materialists called <em>cārkavā-s,</em> or, the nihilists like <em>Sage Jābāli</em>,

like Buddhists and Jain-s etc., try hard to let down what Veda says, with all their masterly dialectics. 
Even then, at one stage or the other, they all yield up, or a stalemate, or a faux pas occurs in their 
debates. Thus, no scholar need abuse the scriptures, for he does not know the subject in its entirety, 
or what those scriptures contain. <em>anena shruti pratipanno artho na ābhāsaiḥ tarkaiḥ bādhayitum

This Seetha is compared with Veda-s, one to many times, for the reason of her sacredness as a devout

of Scriptures of Veda-s...</p>

<p class="comment">
Basing on these references of Seetha to Vedic canons, there is a thinking that the subject of Ramayana 
is the problem of god in retrieving the lost word, where that word was with the god at the beginning. 
Seetha is Veda, the word, Gayatri etc. And god has lost it. In search of that word, Veda, Gayatri, the 
god started his search. In his search he helps all those who abide by &#39;word&#39; or &#39;faithful to word&#39; and 
ultimately annihilates the demons that falsify or abuse the &#39;word.&#39;</p>
