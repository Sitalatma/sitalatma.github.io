<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">
Rama after killing demon Viradha enters the hermitage of Sage Sharabhanga, as advised by the dying demon Viradha in the 
previous episode. Sage Sharabhanga refuses the invitation of Indra to come to heaven, but awaits the arrival of Rama to 
see him with his own eyes. After seeing Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana, and also showing next course of their journey, that 
Sage enters the yogic fire and ascends to Brahma&#39;s abode.</p>

beast, [Bos grunniens] and the hair will be studded into a golden or silver handle. These are not for actual air circulation 
but they are royal insignias.</p>

Comment: This verse in Gorakhpur version is said to be containing improper word placements thus confusing in its meaning. 
Some ancient manuscripts are said to contain this as,</p>

<p class="Itrṣloka">

<p class="comment">
Comment: Vishnu is said to have instructed all the divinities to not to talk to him during his human incarnation on earth 
as Rama. If any divine being comes into direct contact and conducts a dialogue, Rama&#39;s identity as Vishnu is revealed, and 
Ravana will apprehend that and then revokes his boon of not to be killed by any divine being. As long as Ravana believes 
Rama to be a human being, so long he dares any human to confront, because he slighted humans when seeking his boon. Ravana 
can be ended only by Rama, but not by others. Hence, Indra departed from there before the arrival of Rama.</p>

The word <em>paricchada</em> means, that which encloses anything, apart from its ordinary meaning, attendants, retinue etc. Here 
the enclosures for Rama are Seetha and Lakshmana. As with any deity in a sanctum sanctorum, who is enclosed by impregnable 
walls and sanctimonious atmosphere, Rama is enclosed by that impregnable Lakshmana like a firewall, where the sanctimonious

Sage Sharabhanga, with his sixth sense came to know that Vishnu is coming this way and will become his dear guest. He thus 
is obliged to receive Rama in his hermitage. It is his first priority than escaping to Brahma&#39;s abode. The sage with his 
own arduous penance attained that travel to Brahma&#39;s heavens and he can go there anytime. But seeing Rama, who is now a 
human incarnate, with his own human eyes is prime ordeal to that Sage. Secondly, ascending to heavens with mortal body is 
an impracticable affair. Hence the mortal body is to be cast off here only. If that mortal body is cast off, as per the 
request of Indra, the sage&#39;s mortal eyes cannot see Rama, for Rama leaves this earth after fulfilling his vow of eradicating 
evil, and equally, a Sage of high order like Sharabhanga, on going to Brahma&#39;s abode will not return as an earthling. Hence 
seeing and receiving Rama is his priority now.</p>

<p class="comment">
In Gorakhpur version it is <em>avaram, a+varam</em> . The translation will therefore be &#39;undesirable heavens/lesser heavens...&#39; 
If there is difference between paradise and heaven, this lesser one is paradise; the ordinary <em>swarga</em> of Indra, 
where the departed soul&#39;s merit is metered and count down starts with the enjoyment of heavenly comforts. As and when the 
accumulated merit neutralises there, that soul has to take rebirth in the karmic cycle. <em>kshīṇe puṇye martya lokam pravishanti...</em> 
This sage does not wish to go there, because he earned fartherest heavens like Brahma&#39;s abode or <em>tridiva patham</em> 
etc., by his penance. And those lesser heavens are as cited by Krishna in Bhagavad Gita <em>ābrahma bhavanāllokāḥ punarāvṛitti 
na arjuna...</em> 8-16: and here Krishna also says <em>mām upetyatu...</em> &#39;In me repose yourself...&#39; This &#39;ṃe,&#39; is
<em>tridivam...</em> and <em>tripādvibūti</em> , as cited by <em>puruṣa sūkta</em> n its hymn <em>pādosya vishvā bhūtāni, 
tripādasya amṛitam divi...</em>&#39; etc. Dharmākootam puts it as <em>brahma lokam gamiṣyāmi tridivam deva sevitam...</em> 
without separating this concept into two kinds of heavens, namely paradise and Brahma&#39;s abode. Hence there is nothing enjoyable 
in any of the said heavens, than having a glance at you. ṃaheshvara Tīrtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: The sage is dedicating all his achievements of penance unto god, without any <em>ahamtva buddhi</em> , mine-ness. 
This is called <em>phala samarpaṇa</em>. The fruits of pious achievements are to be dedicated in the divine without the 
concept &#39;I am the doer thus I shall enjoy...&#39; Even in the daily worship we are supposed to dedicate all that we have done, 
with oblating water saying &#39; <em>karomi yad yat sakalam parsmai nārāyaṇāyeti samarpayāmi...</em> &#39;Whatever is done, 
in all its entirety, I dedicate it unto the Supreme...&#39; And Govindaraja observes, whatever that is acquired by the sage 
is his wealth. So the heavenly abodes are his only wealth as of now, and they all are surrendered to Rama, as guest-worship.</p>

<p class="comment">
Comment: Thus <em>āhara</em> means gaining, win-over, or snatching, stealing. Hence Rama as a king refutes that donation, 
telling that he alone will acquire those worlds, in an explicit meaning, that conceals Rama&#39;s identity as Vishnu. Vishnu 
has Himself given those merits to this sage, as said in Bhagavadgita. Implicitly all the merits of earthly beings merge 
into that Absolute ultimately, and hence any fresh donation from the sage is negated. The dictionary meaning of <em>āhara</em> 
is provider, fetcher, and Vishnu Himself is the fetcher, provider. In another way, <em>āhara</em> is to take, or snatch 
away, or merge and thus Rama is said to express &#39;I snatch away everything and anything done by my true devotee...for he 
does not do it for his own sake...&#39; This is said to be God&#39;s <em>karma phala swīkāra</em> &#39;receiving of the fruits of 
work...</p>

<p class="comment">
Sage Sharabhanga said, <em>eṣha panthā naravyāghraḥ</em> meaning that &#39;this is the only recourse, oh, manly-tiger.&#39; Here 
Rama asked Sage Sharabhanga to show a place to dwell. Sharabhanga&#39;s hermitage itself will now become vacant after the sage&#39;s 
ascension to heavens. But it is not shown to Rama to stay, instead yet another distant place is shown. All these Sages and 
Saints show only one path that Rama, Seetha and Lakshmana have to travel, i.e., towards Ravana, the evil on earth. From 
here they are directed to Sage Suteekshna&#39;s hermitage, there from to Sage Agastya&#39;s hermitage, and there from, to still 
deeper place in forests, called Panchavati. According to Kaikeyi&#39;s banishment Rama need not travel this far, but could have 
resided in some near-about forests of River Ganga. But one after the other, either demons who became celestials or sages 
who are going to become divinities, all usher Rama southward, i.e., towards the dominions of demons, whom Rama has to eradicated 
from earth. &#39;If Rama were to enter into Panchavati, a powerful dominion of demons like Khara and Dushana, alleging their 
loyalties to Ravana, it is definite that an encounter will ensue and Rama will start eradicating one after the other, and 
ultimately ending with Ravana...&#39; this appears to be the logic of all the sages. As such Rama is asked to go on travelling 
towards the evil side of the earth, for all of the sages know about Rama&#39;s destination</p>

Then the question arises whether Sage Sharabhanga wilfully encompassed the sin of suicide or not? Not so, because it is

If it were to be an ordinary pyre, the mortal body do not burn completely to ashes as the skull and vertebral bones remain, 
for immersion into holy waters after a while. Here it is said that nothing remained. Further scriptures lay it down that: 
Hence Sage Sharabhanga, having seen Rama, got that divine knowledge and there is nothing left for him to accomplish with 
his mortal body, and hence entered the holy fire. Those that are superior in character and virtue, even the of Fire, Agni 
Deva, cannot even touch, rather provides a coolant condition in His lap. It is the same with Seetha in Yuddha Kanda and 
it also happened with Queen chandramati, the virtuous wife of Emperor Harishchandra, one of the forefathers of Rama. Thus
