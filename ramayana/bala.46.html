<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Diti seeks for a son to kill Indra because Indra and other gods have killed her sons 
in the battle after churning Milk Ocean. But Indra, being her stepson arrives at her place of asceticism, 
with view to destroy that Indra-killer. On a fateful day when Diti failed to maintain the procedure 
of vow, Indra enters her womb and dissects the foetus into seven fragments, which later become

<p class="RomSloka">hateṣu teṣu putreṣu ditiḥ parama duḥkhitā |<br>mārīcam kāśyapam rāma bhartāram idam

<p class="pratipada"><em>1. raama</em> = oh, Rama; <em>teSu putreSu hateSu</em> = those, sons, while 
being killed; <em>ditiH parama duHkhitaa</em> = Diti, is highly, anguished; <em>bhartaaram maariicam 
kaashyapam</em> = to husband, son of Mareechi, to sage Kaashyapa; <em>idam abraviit</em> = this, said.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Oh, Rama, Lady Diti was highly anguished for those sons that are killed and said this 
to her husband, Sage Kashyapa, the son of Sage Maareechi.&quot; Thus Vishvamitra continued narration. [1-46-1]</p>

<p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 2</strong> </p>

<p class="RomSloka">hata putrā asmi bhagavan tava putraiḥ mahābalaiḥ |<br>śakra hantāram icchāmi putram

<p class="pratipada"><em>2. bhagavan</em> = oh, god; <em>mahaa balaiH</em> = great mighty ones; <em>
tava putraiH</em> = by your, sons; <em>hata putraa asmi</em> = killed, sons, I am - my sons are killed;
<em>shakra hantaaram</em> = Indra, exterminator of; <em>diirgha tapoH jitam</em> = by sustained, penance, 
one who can be achievable; <em>such a; <em>putram</em> = son; <em>icChaami</em> = I wish - to bear.</em></p>

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Oh, god, I am bereaved of my sons who are killed by your great mighty sons, the sons 
of your second wife Aditi, as such I wish to bear a son, who is achievable by sustained penance, for 
he shall be the exterminator of Indra. [1-46-2]</p>

<p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 3</strong> </p>

<p class="RomSloka">sā aham tapaḥ cariṣyāmi garbham me dātum arhasi |<br>īśvaram śakra hantāram tvam

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;Such a bereaved mother as I am, I wish to undertake asceticism for a son who shall 
become an exterminator of Indra, and who shall be the ruler of worlds. As such, it will be apt of you 
to permit me for asceticism, and further it will be apt of you to accord me pregnancy with such a son.&#39; 
Thus Diti spoke to her husband Kaashyapa. [1-46-3]</p>

<p class="comment">A sage&#39;s wife requires permission of her husband if she wishes to undertake an individual 
asceticism, because she will be receiving her own share of merit from her sage-husband&#39;s penances and 
practises, as he is her life-mate.</p>

to Diti; <em>prati uvaaca</em> = in reply, said.</p>

<p class="tat">On hearing her request the great resplendent sage Kaashyapa, the son of Sage Mareechi, 
replied Diti, who is deeply mournful. [1-46-4]</p>

<p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 5</strong> </p>

<p class="RomSloka">evam bhavatu bhadram te śuciḥ bhava tapodhane |<br>janayiṣyasi putram tvam śakra

<p class="pratipada">5. <em>tapaH dhane</em> = oh, ascetically, wealthy one - Lady Diti; <em>evam bhavatu</em>

[abide by]; <em>tvam</em> = you; <em>aahave shakra hantaaram</em> = in war, Indra&#39;s, exterminator; such

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;So be it... oh, ascetically wealthy lady, you be blest, if you abide by the propriety 
of the practises of asceticism, then you will be delivering a son who can become an exterminator of 
Indra in war. [1-46-5]</p>

<p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 6</strong> </p>

<p class="RomSloka">pūrṇe varṣa sahasre tu śuciḥ yadi bhaviṣyasi |<br>putram trailokya hantāram mattaḥ

<p class="tat">&quot; &#39;If you can complete a thousand years of asceticism punctiliously, by my grace you 
can deliver a son who can be a husbander of three worlds.&#39; Thus Sage Kaashyapa advised his wife Diti. 
[1-46-6]</p>

<p class="comment">In some other versions the word <em>trailokya hantaaram</em> is carried forward from 
earlier verses of Diti, into the speech of Sage Kaashyapa also. Some have it as <em>trailokya bhartaaram</em> 
&#39;a husbander of three worlds...&#39; Diti may have desired for a &#39;killer.&#39; But Kashyapa, as a father of 
both gods and demons, cannot term the issuing son as an exterminator of three worlds, because the three 
worlds are in vogue at Kaashyapa&#39;s grace. Some attach this adjective to Indra but not to the forthcoming 
son of Diti.</p>

<p class="verloc"><strong>Sloka 7</strong> </p>

<p class="RomSloka">evam uktvā mahā tejāḥ pāṇinā sa mamārja tām |<br>tam ālabhya tataḥ svasti iti uktvā

<p class="pratipada"><em>7. mahaa tejaaH</em> = great resplendent [sage]; <em>saH</em> = he, Kaashyapa;

<em>tam aalabhya tataH</em> = her, on touching [her,] then; <em>svasti iti uktvaa</em> = be blest, thus, 
on saying; <em>[saH</em> = he, Kaashyapa]; <em>tapase yayau</em> = for ascetic practises, departed.</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;Saying thus that great resplendent sage patted her, and then on his touching her she 
is consecrated, and then that sage Kaashyapa departed for his ascetic practises, saying &#39;be blest.&#39; 
[1-46-7]</p>

<p class="tat">&quot;When Diti was saying thus, the noontime sun was reigning high that lady is stolen over 
by sleep keeping her feet headward. [1-46-16]</p>

<p class="comment">This &#39;keeping feet headward&#39; is variously inferred. While sitting she leaned on her 
knees and her braid touched feet, thus she became impious. She slept with her head neither towards east 
nor to south. The ancient cots in India used to have head-side and feet-side finishing. Then she placed 
head at feet-side and feet at head-side. Even if a cot is not there, though slept on ground, the head 
shall be positioned eastward or southward, but not to north or west. Finally, she slept at noontime, 
and for a person under a vow noontime sleep is prohibitive. <em>anena vratasthaanaam divaa svaapaH paada 
sthaane shiraH sthaapanam ca ashucikaram iti suucitam - dk</em> Hence her meticulousness is defeated.</p>
