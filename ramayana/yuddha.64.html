<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Mahodara excitedly speaks to Kumbhakarna about the true character of virtue, worldly gain as well as sensuous pleasure in a person and
supports Ravana for his actions. He advises Kumbhakarna not to go single-handed to fight with mighty Rama, but to take the army with him. Mahodara
then suggests to Ravana a strategy to fulfill his purpose without a combat.</p>
