Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 64<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama finds Seetha's flowers and footprints, followed by heavy footprints of some male massive demon. On detailed probing there appear
some more ruins of a combat between two warriors. Concluding that Seetha is definitely abducted by a massive demon, Rama wants to countermove the
universe, even by waging a war with gods.</p>

"These frightful looking arrows of somebody are gilded and they are as much as a chariot's axle in their thickness, but their
arrowheads are shred and they are manifoldly shredded and strewn around... [3-64-48, 49a]</p>
<p class="comment">The sizes of Ravana's arrows are calculated differently. This ratha aksha mātra is taken as the length of chariot's wheel and
thus it is said four-hundred inches or some 33 feet, which is unacceptable to some as Ravana did not travel in his chariot with a mega body. In
another way aksha is taken as the 'eye of axle...' Then the diameter of his arrow is said, 'as thick as an axle...' Some others said the size of
arrow is eighty-four inches according to shilpa shāstra 'science of chariot making...' taking this 'eye of axle' into consideration.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The expressions of Rama throughout this chapter are not just
<font color="#B3003A">weeps, wails, or moans...</font> but they have aesthetic values of epical hero. But to take up one in the last stanza, it bears

<p style="text-indent: 50px" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">So also is the ire of Arjuna in ṃaha Bharata. A valiantly victorious
person does not sink deep into his own sorrow, but tries to counteract. Here Rama is counteracting with gods and nature, while Arjuna of ṃaha Bharata
had to the same with his brothers and relatives. That is why Gita had to be imbibed into the mind of Arjuna, when he was at loss to know why he shall
war his own brothers, teachers, grandparents et al. Having heard whole of Gita and having followed Krishna's advices, Arjuna though bewails a lot
when his son Abhimanyu was murdered, becomes infuriated at the treacherous murder of the boy, and then escalated were his guts to fight back his
enemies. <font face="Translit 98" size="2em" color="#B3003A"><span style=

and so forth... Thus, Arjuna takes a severe oath to eliminate his enemies. Here Rama too has a Krishna like counsellor in Lakshmana, but less are
Lakshmana's chances in convincing Rama, as Rama is a 'doer' rather than a 'preacher' like Krishna, or a 'student' like Arjuna. However, Lakshmana
pacifies the fury of Rama in the next episode.</font></p>
