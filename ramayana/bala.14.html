<p class="comment">
Comment: In <em>aswametha yaga</em> , a well-decorated horse will be let out with an insignia 
on its forehead challenging any king to capture it and face the wrath of releasing king. If 
any one captures the horse, he shall be strong enough to incite a war. Otherwise, the valour 
and invincibility of releasing king are well established and he may proceed with the ritual 
proper. Now that the ritual horse released during last year by King Dasharatha has come back 
without being captured by anyone, thus establishing the invincibility of King Dasharatha, 
as such he can commence the ritual proper.</p>

<p class="comment">
Some scholars tend to conclude that Ramayana might have been written in post Buddhist period 
by finding the words like <em>shramaṇa</em> etc., the famous wandering Buddhist monk sect. 
The word <em>shramaṇa</em> in Sanskrit means only a pilgrim, and pilgrimage is an ordained 
aspect of salvation as per <em>Indra is the friend of traveller. Therefore wander - aitareya 
brahmaṇa [VII.33.3]</em> The Buddhist <em>shramaṇa</em> -s are the wandering monks in search 
of converts whereas Hindu <em>shramana</em>-s are pure <em>sanyasi</em>-s wandering for their 
own salvation.</p>

<h3>yajna - the Vedic Ritual</h3>

<p  class="comment">
Vedic yajna-s are the rituals of many kinds. ṃainly there are 21 types of these yajna-s, 1] <em>
sapta pāka yajna-s </em>are 7; 2] <em>sapta havir yajna-s </em>are 7; 3] <em>
sapta soma yajna-s </em>are 7. Apart from these rituals, there are rituals for the overall 
development of society at large, called <em>abhyudayaka yajna-s </em>and under 
them categorised are: 1] <em>ashvanmedha</em>, 2] <em>
rājasūya</em>, 3] <em>paunDarīka</em>, 4] <em>bṛihaspati 
sava</em>, and some more are there. These grand scale rituals require a great patronage and 
support, not only of money but also of a variety of paraphernalia that go into the ritual. Hence 
only kings and emperors of yester years could conduct them.</p>

<p  class="comment">The <em>
yāga shāla </em>The Hall of Vedic ritual will be erected with platforms containing areas 1] <em>
yūpa stambha-s </em>wooden posts to which the animals are tied. There will be 21 such posts, 
staked in the Vedic ritual hall, along with a half post staked near at the main altar; 2] <em>
uttara vedi</em>, posterior platform; 3] <em>dasha pada</em>, platform for 
scholars; 4] <em>havirdhāna</em>, place for oblatory paraphernalia; 5] <em>
sadas</em>, place for assemblages; 6] <em>agnihotra shāla</em>, place of 
sacrificial fire; 7] <em>vedi</em>, main Altar of Fire; 8] <em>
patnī shāla</em>, place for the wife / wives of the performer and other females. The main 
activity of the ritual is around the <em>vedi</em>, the 7th item as above, where 
a <em>garuDa vedi</em>, an Eagle shaped Alter of Fire will be constructed with 
bricks, where the brick laying and paving itself is a ritual, called <em>iṣṭikā 
chayana </em>. Into this <em>yajna vedi</em>, Altar of Fire, all the oblations 
are poured.</p>

<p  class="comment">The 
Hindu temples will be built in accordance with the layout of <em>yajna shāla</em>, 
since the daily <em>pūja</em>, at home or in a temple, is a micro-yajna, 
equable to Vedic Ritual itself. The layout of the temple is comparable to the above layout of <em>
yajna shāla </em>.</p>

<p class="comment">1] <em>dhavaja sthambha</em>, flag 
post; 2] <em>bali griha</em>, sacrificial house; 3] <em>bali 
pīṭtha </em>sacrificial platform, where usually the fruits, coconuts, <em>
prasada</em>, food items etc., are presented to the deity firstly, before the devotee partakes 
them, as a kind of sacrifice; 4] <em>havirdhana</em>, preparatory places for <em>
havis</em>, the food for sacrifice, usually in north-east or south-west corners; 5] <em>
mandapa
</em>open hall, where Vedic recitations are chanted; 6] <em>garbha griha</em>, 
sanctum sanctorum, in this there are two places one is, 7] <em>pratishtha</em>, 
the place where the picturesque idol is installed, and the other, 8] <em>shakti 
sthāna</em>, where the power of the installed deity will be installed, in the form of an <em>
yantra</em>, a geometrical layout or other form. [For more information, please turn to The 
cultural Heritage of India, Vol IV, Religion.]</p>

<p class="comment">The next epitome of <em>yajna</em>, is 
human body. It is said that <em>deho devalayaḥ proktaḥ </em>‘human body itself 
is a temple...’ The above places of Ritual Hall or a Temple are located on body as this: 1] <em>
sthūpi [kalasha]</em>, the top most golden pot of flagpoist of temple; 2] <em>
mahā nashi </em>the right nostril and <em>kshudra nasi</em>, left nostril; 3] <em>
shikhara</em>, temple tower; 4] <em>ghaṭa</em>, neck like structure; 5] <em>
prastāram</em>, shoulder like structure of temple; 6] <em>pāda</em>, trunk 
of temple; 7] <em>adhiṣṭāna</em>, elevation; 8] <em>upa 
pīṭha</em>, secondary seating. This is compared with human body as: Item 1] to human pate with 
hair-locks; 2] eye - on right and nose on left [for humans have one-eyed vision of God, where God is 
Omniscient; 3] face; 4] neck; 5] shoulders; 6] arms; 7] leg and thigh; 8] foot.</p>

<p class="comment">‘A temple is not a home of god but it is the form of 
god... the temple layout is the extended form of the rhythm of the innerspace of humans, called <em>
dahara ākāsha </em>similar to cosmos of the universe...&#39; [cf. What is a temple? What is its 
significance? Ganapathi Sthapati, Vāstu Vedic Research Foundation, chennai, India.] Thus human body 
itself is identified with the temple, and the temple in turn with <em>Vedic yajna 
shāla </em>, and therefore it is said to keep the body clean and mind pure... which again is a 
Vedic import.</p>

<p class="comment">The grand scale yajna-s as described in these epics like 
Ramayana and ṃaha Bharata are non-existent. But in recent times, such types of yajna-s were 
conducted on two occasions, once in 1975 and again in 1990. Here are some excerpts from The Indian 
Express, daily newspaper, published during ṃay 1990: ‘Prof. Frits Stāl, with financial assistance 
from several American funding agencies including the Smithsonian Institute and the Rockefeller 
Foundation, organized the <em>agni chayana </em>ritual in 1975. In spite of 
innumerable hurdles, Stāl succeeded in persuading the elderly nambudri-s [scholarly priests of 
Vedic lore] to put together a team of ritualists old and young, give them through training, hold 
rehearsals for several months and finally put up performance for filming and documentation. Stāl 
followed this up with the publication of his book called <em>Agni </em>...&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">Readers who are interested to know more about <em>
yajna</em>, the Vedic ritual, may please look for the works of Prof. Frits Stāl, Indologist, at 
whose instance such rituals were conducted in Southern India. The two-volume book of <em>
Prof. Frits Stāl: AGṇI: The Vedic Ritual of the Fire Altar</em>, running over some two thousand 
pages. Another book is <em>The ṃantra, </em>which is an attempt to analyse the 
Vedic Hymns, published by State University of New York Press, State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y., 
12246, also now available with Indian Book Centre, Delhi</p>

<p class="comment">According to Stāl, a Vedic ritual is very different from 
a health cure, a psychoanalyst session, an anthropological meeting or a religious service. Stāl 
maintains that a Vedic ritual follows its own principles and leads a life of its own. He points out 
that a Vedic ritual requires very detailed and specific knowledge. He estimates that the extent of 
specialised knowledge needed to put the sacrificial altar together ritually is on a par with the 
extent of technical knowledge required to build an aeroplane. <em>‘The bird shaped 
altar is in fact a kind of aeroplane…’ </em>says Stall <em>‘only it takes off in 
a different way…’ </em>Scientific evaluations were also made on the changes occurred on physical 
and metaphysical levels on the individuals who performed the ritual, by experts from Canada and in 
association with Prague Institute of Czechoslovakia. Kirlion photography was also undertook by ṃrs. 
Rose ṃary Steel from London to record aura or the Electro-magnetic radiation around the human 
organism and hundreds of pictures of not only the performers but also of the visiting people and of 
their finger tips are recorded.</p>

<p class="comment">Usually at the end of any Vedic ritual the Hall of Ritual, 
a thatched shed, will be put to fire. This called <em>pūrṇa āhuti</em>, 
complete oblation into fire. And then a rain occurs. It used to rain every time when the ritual is 
totally offered as an oblation into fire at the conclusion of such a ritual. ‘The association 
between the yajna and rain is indelible. Did it rain on [the day of <em>pūrṇa 
āhuti </em>] i.e., ṃay 9, 1990? It did...’ The Illustrated Weekly of India, ṃay 27, 1990.</p>
