	to do so, in order to keep up the tranquillity of those hermitages, and also to obliterate the menace of demons from 
	earth.</p>

	a speedy charioteer, is the question. This <em>mahā rathaḥ</em> concept is on the analogy of Krishna the charioteer 
	in Bharata. In Vedanta, the human body is frequently referred as <em>ratha</em>, as in <em>ashva krānte rathaḥ krānte 
	vishṇukrānte vasu.ndharā...</em> , Sec. I-37 ṃahanārāyano panishad: &#39;O, earth that is traversed by a horse [in Vedic 
	rituals,] a chariot, [great souls, why they all when] Vishnu himself treaded on you as Trivikrama... hence I pray you...&#39; 
	Hence the chariot, drawn by the five-senses as its horses, and the earth are also brought and said here by sages. Krishna-Arjuna&#39;s 
	chariot too had five-horses. Here the sages with controlled senses, namely horses, are asking the one who chariots/spins 
	the earth and earthlings, to take off the children of lesser gods, namely demons, far away from humans where humans 
	are god controlled species.</p>
