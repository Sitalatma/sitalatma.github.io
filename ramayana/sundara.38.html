<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 38<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Hanuma asks Seetha to give him a token of remembrance, which Rama can recognize. Seetha 
then narrates the episode of a crow which occurred on the Chitrakuta mountain and requests Hanuma to 
repeat it before Rama by way of a token of recollection. She further sends greetings to both Rama and 
Lakshmana, conveys her enquiry about their welfare and conveys to them her resolve to survive only for 
a month after the expiry of the time-limit given by Ravana. Thereupon, she hands over to Hanuma her 
jewel for the head as a token of remembrance.</p>
