<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Preceded by Dasaratha's wives and others, Vasishta advances to the hermitage of Rama. Kausalya, on the way, shows to her co-wives the
balls of Ingudi fruit-pulp offered to the spirits of Dasaratha by Rama on blades of Dabha grass, the raised spikes of which pointed towards the
south; along the bank of Mandakini River. Kausalya was stricken with anguish for her deceased husband. Reaching the hermitage, both Rama and
Lakshmana hold the feet of the Queens in salutation. Kausalya feels sad at the fate of Seetha in the forest, when the latter touches her feet. Rama
holds the feet of his preceptor and takes his seat. Accompanied by his ministers, Bharata also sits nearby.</p>
