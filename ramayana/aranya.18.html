: Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 18<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Oct 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama averts Shūrpanakha&#39;s advances toward him and asks her to seek Lakshmana instead. Lakshmana uses 
wordplay in retorting her in her own words. But she takes the apparent meaning of Lakshmana&#39;s words 
and rushes to eat away Seetha. Lakshmana defaces her and she noisily runs away from there, only to report 
to her brother Khara, a violent demon. This is the triggering situation of another round of troubles 
to Rama and Ramayana.</p>

<strong>Sloka 1</strong></p>

<p class="Romsloka">
tām tu śūrpaṇakhām rāmaḥ kāma pāśa avapāśitām |<br>svacchhayā ślakṣṇayā vācā smita pūrvam atha abravīt 
|| 3-18-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. rāmaḥ</em> = Rama; <em>kāma pāsha ava pāshitām</em> = by, lust&#39;s, noose, tethered down;
<em>tām shūrpaṇakhām</em> = to her, ṣhūrpanakha; <em>svacchayā shlakṣṇayā vācā</em> = clearly, 
softly, with voice; <em>smita pūrvam</em> = smile, preceded by; <em>atha abravīt</em> = then, said.</p>

<p class="tat">
Rama then voicing clearly and softly spoke to her, whom the noose of lust has tethered down, with a 
smile preceding his words. [3-18-1]</p>

<p class="verloc">
<strong>Sloka 2</strong></p>

<p class="Romsloka">
kṛta dāro asmi bhavati bhāryā iyam dayitā mama |<br>tvat vidhānām tu nārīṇām suduḥkhā sasapatnatā || 
3-18-2</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. bhavati</em> = oh, honourable one; <em>kṛita dāraḥ asmi</em> = made, married, I am; <em>iyam 
mama dayitā bhāryā</em> = this is, my, dear, wife; <em>tvat vidhānām tu</em> = to your, sort of 
[females,] but; <em>nārīṇām</em> = females; <em>sa sapatnatā</em> = [living] with, co-wife; <em>
su duḥkhā</em> = will be distressing.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Oh, honourable one, I am married and this is my dear wife, thus it will be distressing for your sort 
of females to live with a co-wife. [3-18-2]</p>

<p class="verloc">
<strong>Sloka 3</strong></p>

<p class="Romsloka">
anujaḥ tu eṣa me bhrātā śīlavān priya darśanaḥ |<br>śrīmān akṛta dāraḥ ca lakṣmaṇo nāma vīryavān || 
3-18-3</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>3. lakṣmaṇaḥ nāma</em> = Lakshmana, named; <em>eṣa anujaḥ me bhrātā</em> = he is, younger one, 
my, brother; <em>shīlavān</em> = with good conduct; <em>priya darshanaḥ</em> = good looking one;
<em>shrīmān</em> = promising one; <em>vīryavān</em> = valiant one; <em>a kṛita dāraḥ ca</em> = 
not, made, wife   nearly, not with a wife.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He is my younger brother named Lakshmana, he is with a good conduct, good looking, a promising and 
valiant one, and he is without a wife. [3-18-3]</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama is punning here. In punning apparent meaning will be different than the latent and the apparent 
appears to an untruth. Then if it is questioned whether Rama tells a lie while joking or punning, it 
is not so: <em>nyāya - gurūṇam api samam hāsyam kartavyam kutilam vinā</em> &#39;even with teachers 
one can be humorous, if it is not fraudulent&#39;. According to <em>dharmākūtam</em> which quotes <em>
gautam sūtra: vivāha maithuna narma ātra saṃyogeṣu adoṣakakameke anṛitam</em>; and in <em>āpad 
dharma sūtra: na narma yuktam anṛitam hi na asti na strīṣu rājan na vivāha kāle</em> &#39;at the time 
of marriage or copulation or with women talking untruth [or with innuendo, or punning,] is not wrong.&#39;</p>

<p class="comment">
Again if it be asked whether Rama really said in jocular way or in real sense, it is said that he has 
not joked. <em>navevamapi rāma vacanam parihāsa rūpamiti katham nishcitamiti cet na</em> for this 
Rama&#39;s words at 3-18-19 will suffice, <em>saumitre parihāsaḥ kathaṃcana</em> &#39;Lakshmana.... no joking 
with this kind of beings please...&#39; dharmākūtam.</p>

<p class="comment">
Rama is known to be a jovial talker, <em>na vitathā parihāsa kathhasvapi</em> Here for the word
<em>a kṛita dāraḥ</em> apparently means &#39;not, made, wife= wife not available.&#39; But Lakshmana is married 
and Rama says here he is unmarried. Then Rama must have bluffed! Not so, that compound is in its subtext 
means: &#39;one who did not make his wife to come along, hence there is no wife.&#39; Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">
In another way, the word <em>a</em> in <em>a kṛite</em> also means <em>antaḥpura</em> according to 
the thesaurus of <em>a</em> and it is said as: <em>akāro brahma vishṇu īsha kamaṭheṣva~Ngaṇe, gaurave 
antaḥpure</em> palace-chambers of queens; and thus the meaning is as: &#39;one who left behind his wife 
in palace-chambers, hence he has no wife.&#39;</p>

<strong>Sloka 4</strong></p>

<p class="Romsloka">
apūrvī bhāryayā ca arthī taruṇaḥ priya darśanaḥ |<br>anurūpaḥ ca te bhartā rūpasya asya bhaviṣyati || 
3-18-4</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>4. a pūrvī</em> = without, a wife; <em>bhāryayā ca arthī</em> = for wife, also, in need of;
<em>taruṇaḥ</em> = youthful one; <em>priya darshanaḥ</em> = good, looking; <em>te rūpasya asya</em> 
= by your, features, that kind of; <em>anu rūpaḥ bhartā</em> = fitly, husband;; <em>bhaviṣyati</em> 
= he becomes.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;He is without a wife and in need of a wife  he is youthful, good-looking and he can become a fitly 
husband of yours, fit enough to your kind of features. [3-18-4]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>apūrvi</em> means in the viewpoint of Rama &#39;one who has been missing the company of wife 
for a long&#39; but in Shūrpanakha&#39;s view it is &#39;one who is missing the company of AṇY wife for a long...&#39; 
The word <em>bhāryā ca arthī</em> is from Rama&#39;s view &#39;desiring his own wife, Urmila&#39; but in Shūrpanakha&#39;s 
view &#39;desiring AṇY woman as wife&#39; and the word <em>te bhartā</em> is declined as <em>te.abhartā= te 
a bhartā</em> &#39;unfit to be your husband&#39; because of your <em>rūpasya asyā</em> &#39;by your aspect, your 
repulsive aspect.&#39; Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">
In another way <em>akṛita dāraḥ</em> &#39;already a married man&#39; <em>apūrvī</em> &#39;one who does not have 
the comfort from wife&#39; so <em>bharyayā ca arthī; a + pūrva bhāryayā ca arthī</em> &#39;for a new wife, 
also, desiring one; one who is desiring new wife; thus you are a fitly wife for him by your aspect,
<em>anurūpascha te</em> . This is on joculary side of the statement <em>parihāsa anukūla prātītaka 
artha</em>. The implicit meaning is <em>akṛita dāraḥ</em> &#39;one without a wife now or one who does 
not take another wife.&#39; <em>apūrva bhāryayā</em> by first wife alone, <em>arthī</em> he is desired;
<em>shīlavān, eka patnī vrata shīla vantaḥ</em> an abider in the syndrome of &#39;one-man-one-wife.&#39;
<em>priya darshanaḥ</em> &#39;in dear ones, tend towards; tending towards his dear ones.&#39; <em>te.abhrtā= 
te + a + bhartā</em> &#39;for you, no, husband; he is no husband of yours, he can never be your husband.&#39;
<em>anu rūpaḥ</em> &#39;fit for his own wife.&#39; <em>asya rūpasya yogya bhaviṣyati?</em> &#39;with this kind 
of, aspect of yours   for you with such a notorious aspect, will he be eligible to become your husband? 
No, he will not.&#39; ṃaheshvara Tīrtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>apūrvi</em> is categorised under rare and unfamiliar words. It is said that as per rock 
edicts it is a traveller, <em>brahmacāri</em> celibate, who is studying <em>apūrva,</em> namely Veda-s. 
As <em>mimāmsikā-s</em> tell us that <em>apūrva</em> is divineness, results from Vedic knowledge. 
Here the celibate state of Lakshmana is said to have been referred, &#39;though he is having his wife Urmila, 
he is undergoing celibacy.&#39; And further &#39;In Gorresio&#39;s text it is there as <em>taruṇo bhāryayā ca 
arthī</em> where <em>taruṇa</em> is youthfulness. Rama is also youthful. So Rama&#39;s expression of
<em>apurvī</em> is just to indicate Lakshmana as a <em>brahmacāri</em> a celibate, though he has a 
wife and youthful also. After Prof. Satya Vrat. Unchained is he by nuptial bands: is Griffith&#39;s wording.</p>

<strong>Sloka 5</strong></p>

<p class="Romsloka">
enam bhaja viśālākṣi bhartāram bhrātaram mama |<br>asapatnā varārohe merum arka prabhā yathā || 3-18-5</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>5. vishālākṣi</em> = oh, broad-eyed one; <em>vara ārohe</em> = great, waisted one; <em>enam mama 
bhrātaram</em> = him, my, brother; <em>arka prabhā merum yathā</em> = sun&#39;s, shine, on ṃt. ṃeru, 
like; <em>a sapatnā</em> = without, a co-wife; <em>bhartāram</em> = as husband; <em>bhaja</em> = you 
pray   you woo.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;You woo him, oh, board-eyed [bulged-eyed] one, this brother of mine as your husband like sunshine seeking 
the ṃt. ṃeru, then oh, great-waisted [pot-bellied] one, you will be without a co-wife &quot; So said Rama 
to that demoness. [3-18-5]</p>

<p class="comment">
The sunshine seeking ṃt. ṃeru will spread over it, and on going at its behind, the sun disappears along 
with his shine. Such a massive mountain is that. Thus ṃt. ṃeru is an absolver <em>nivṛitti pradāta</em> 
of sunshine. So also you reach Lakshmana and become absolved in him / by him. Govindaraja. Secondly, 
you adore Lakshmana like <em>bhartāram</em> a husband, a Providence of all in the universe. ṃaheshvara 
Tīrtha.</p>

<p class="comment">
Lakshmana tolerates anything but lets no fly to fly over Seetha. He may defy his brother Rama, but never 
tolerates belittlement of Seetha, and lets none to insult her. Now he is retorting Shūrpanakha in the 
same words she used in last chapter when she was speaking about Seetha.</p>

Here Govindaraja says, <em>virūpāma asatīm karālām nirṇatatodarīm vṛidhām tvām parityajya enām

Next, ṃaheshvara Tirtha says the same verse with reference to Seetha, it is: <em>vi + rūpām= visheṣa 
rūpām= tri loka sundarīm</em> with a particular excellence in her beauty in all three worlds; <em>
a + satīm= na anya pativratā syāt samam vā adhikam</em> none, equalling or better in husband-adoration;

slender-waisted, the first attribute a comely lady should have; <em>vṛiddhām= jñāna, shīla, guṇa 
saṃvṛddhi</em> &#39;abounding with intellect, character, conduct etc., not just years of age...&#39;</p>
