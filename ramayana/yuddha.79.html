<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 79<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Fight again ensues between monkeys and demons, when ṃakaraksha enters the battle-field. The monkeys get frightened of ṃakaraksha's
arrows and begin to run away. Rama comes in and intercepts the demons with his hail of arrows. ṃakaraksha challenges Rama to fight with him. Rama
tears off the arrows hurled by ṃakaraksha and ṃakaraksha broke the arrows released by Rama. Finally, Rama breaks the chariot and its horses of his
chariot, stands on the ground, takes a splendorous spike in his hand to fight and hurls it on Rama. Rama chops it off with his four arrows. When
ṃakaraksha rushes towards Rama to fight with his fist, Rama hurls a mystic missile from his bow and kills him on the spot. The demons get frightened
and run away to Lanaka.</p>
