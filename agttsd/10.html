<h3><em>A Gift of Love</em></h3>

</div>
<div id="pp830" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da has given us the gift of love of Godhead along with the glorious mission of distributing it to others. Let us increase the effort to distribute his books more and more, thus forever glorifying his name and fame! (July 31, 1989)
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp831" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
My mission is Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's mission. He wants to produce and distribute his books throughout the world and I want to do that too. I also want to make the Maya&shy;pur Project, and that is his desire. His main desires are my main desires. I have consciously developed my desires in that way. This is an act of the intelligence and the heart. When there is love for the spiritual master then there is a real desire to please him, and this is the best way to please him. So consciously make your desires the same as the desire of your spiritual master and become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (June 6, 1992)

</div>
<div id="pp832" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I have made my life's direction under the order of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da to produce and distribute his books in every language of the world. I am at least trying to do that in my zone and hope that I can encourage others to do it as well. Please also make your life completely dedicated to Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's mission and you will become Kṛṣṇa conscious and completely happy in this life. (April 22, 1992)

This book distribution mission is the highest form of welfare work for the people of this world. All other forms of welfare work miss the mark, for they ultimately are meant to satisfy the senses of certain vested interests. Even if someone is actually sincere in performing welfare work, he does it for his own extended self-interest, such as “my nation,” “my community,” or even “my humanity.” No one is pure in their motivation anymore and no one performs charity in the mode of goodness with the aim of purification. Therefore, our book distributors are the most magnanimous souls, because they are giving people the most precious gift—books about the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa—and taking from them some <em>lakṣ&shy;mī</em>, which is then utilized to print more books and to maintain our wonderful temples wherein the Lord is worshiped and glorified. They cannot do any other activity with their <em>lakṣ&shy;mī</em> that is better than this act of purchasing a book.

<div id="pp834" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Of all of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books, he was most pleased when the big books were distributed. He always wanted big books sold in large quantities, for these big books were specifically written by Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da for creating a revolution in the hearts of misguided humanity. Therefore, you are doing the most important service there in Ireland by distributing the big books of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da. You are leading the way with your good example and determination. This example is going to affect the other devotees there as well, and they will also ultimately take up this process of distributing big books. Therefore, please stay there in Inish&shy;rath and continue to distribute big books and inspire the other distributors to do this as well. This will very much please Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da and the entire di&shy;sci&shy;plic succession. Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books.

<div id="pp835" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

Your service is very valuable. You should remain fixed in that service for a long time and become qualified to realize the Supreme Lord and His eternal pastimes even while you are still in this material body. This is the ultimate result of surrendering one's very life and soul to the book distribution mission of the Lord. You have a great opportunity there and a good field for distribution. Please make it successful and continue there with great enthusiasm. (March 30, 1992)

I think your prayer to the Lord to recover His city for Him is fine. Now please always think in that way, and by your loving devotion you will be able to take over the city for the sake of the Lord. I also think that if you just go on distributing Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books, especially<em> Śrī Īśo&shy;pa&shy;ni&shy;ṣad</em> and the <em>Bha&shy;ga&shy;vad-gītā</em>, then definitely you will feel very happy and satisfied.

</div>
<div id="pp837" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

Here we are making a real <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> revolution. We are distributing all the books for twice the BBT price and thus supporting all the activities of the movement in this way. It is a great struggle and requires great preaching efforts, but we are getting many names and addresses and following them up with full set distribution. It is extremely encouraging. Over four hundred sets were sold in two months. The devotees are determined to try, although their results have gone way down at the start. I am sure that later on the results will be bigger than ever before, but we must be patient. (February 9, 1985)
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp838" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You have distributed many books, and this is very nice. By doing this, you are pleasing Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da in the very best way. It is understood that the father is strict with the children, but the grandfather is lenient and spoils the children. Therefore, you are receiving un&shy;res&shy;tric&shy;ted&shy;ly the mercy of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da, because you are distributing his transcendental literature.

</div>
<div id="pp839" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
There is something very special about distributing on the subways or the platforms in N.Y. I would suppose it is because it is so hellish there. I also did this service and it was always very ecstatic. One can conquer the whole city by distributing <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em> in the subways and platforms. If you also give the people you distribute to some <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, they will never forget you. People there are suffering and looking for love. The last place they expect to find it is on those platforms. Even if they don't take a book then, the <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em> will impress them so much that they will take a book later.

</div>
<div id="pp842" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I have a disturbance. Something is always giving me pain and you, as a surrendered disciple, may dedicate your life to relieving me of that suffering condition. My suffering is that all the fallen souls are without proper knowledge of what is their actual position in relation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Due to this ignorance they are put into so many inconveniences. Therefore, a Vaiṣ&shy;ṇa&shy;va is <em>para-duḥ&shy;kha-duḥ&shy;khī</em>—he is feeling pain when others are feeling pain.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp843" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Therefore, how do you relieve this suffering condition? By distributing more and more books and inspiring others to also do so. By distributing this transcendental literature more and more, you will gradually bring Kali-yuga to a halt and once again establish the Golden Age. Please make this business your life's mission and help others to also take to this mission very seriously. Thus there will be all perfections and blessings poured upon you through the mercy of Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu. (May 6, 1978)
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp844" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The reason we place so much emphasis on book distribution is as follows: People are not very capable of understanding something they hear, especially the first couple of times. People are slow, <em>man&shy;dāḥ</em>, in this age of Kali, and they cannot understand even the simplest things. Therefore, when we speak to them, mostly they go away with a feeling whether this was good or bad, nice or not nice, and little philosophical realization other than that. Sometimes we think ourselves great preachers, but really, although we might be good preachers, the persons we preach to are not good listeners, and therefore, the preaching is not always the most effective means of reaching them.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp845" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Therefore the books. The books are physical objects that speak to them always. They can read the lines again and again until they understand them perfectly. They can read over the course of years and thus learn the philosophy. These books are perfect in all respects, but our preaching is always full of various faults. So whether we preach directly, or perhaps more indirectly, the goal is the same: to give them a set of the books to study. The books have made everyone devotees directly or indirectly. I am not concerned whether you serve in this or that preaching capacity so long as it is authorized by the temple authorities. (March 29, 1988)

<p>
You can understand more about why you are on the streets doing <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> by asking the older devotees why you are there, and also hearing lectures by older devotees, where the subject matter is explained. You are on the street because it is the order of the spiritual master and especially of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da, as he wanted his books distributed far and wide throughout this world. It is the best means of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the more books go out, the more the people will surrender to Kṛṣṇa in due course of time. You are performing the highest welfare work for the people of your country by distributing these books. Please do it with great dedication, and Kṛṣṇa will grant you His mercy without a doubt.

<h3><em>The Higher Taste<br /></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp848" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Sometimes <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees try to do other services, but usually these other services fail in due course of time. Fools think that this is because the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee is incapable of doing anything else, because he was never trained in any other way, but I reject that idea. Training is not the only cause of success in a particular occupation. The main cause is desire and determination. Once a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee gets the taste for saving the conditioned souls directly by giving them a book, he cannot lose that taste, and other services seem pale in comparison.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp849" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
This is not a fault, rather a deep realization. Thus it makes sense that you are useless at other things, because at heart you are a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee. This is the highest form of preaching, and thus your heart is spontaneously attracted to it like a bee to pollen. Do not think there is anything wrong with that, even if oceans of fools and rascals proclaim this from the rooftops.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp850" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You will be situated back in the abode of Kṛṣṇa very quickly simply by doing this <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> service for the rest of your life.

Being brah&shy;mi&shy;ni&shy;cal means to always engage in teaching and helping others. In your case this means to teach, inspire, and do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, avoiding the filthy hole of householder attachments. (March 23, 1985)
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp852" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I am very pleased to hear how you are increasing your book distribution by giving out Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books more and more. There is nothing more satisfying than that. Just go on in this way, without attachment to the results. (Results must be there, since that is the nature of book distribution. We must distribute books and that is a result.) By engaging in this book distribution mission your natural love for Kṛṣṇa will automatically increase more and more by His grace and pleasure. (June 2, 1985)

<p>
You are not a <em>sa&shy;ha&shy;ji&shy;yā</em> if you say that you love to go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. You are simply a normal, fully adjusted <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee. That person who said that we are not yet on that platform, to speak like that, obviously is not on that platform. The <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission is our life and soul and we not only can love it, we should! Please go on loving <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>; it will save you in these troubled times.

</div>
<div id="pp854" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
People are in a very bad state, yet some of them are blissfully becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious despite it all, simply through the reading of Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. This is wonderful. You will see it more and more, since you are out in the world and realizing it daily. Others who stay in the temple cannot understand this. Perhaps also others, even if they go out, also cannot understand this. But you can and that is good.

</div>
<div id="pp855" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Kṛṣṇa will glance on you, since you are spreading His glories. You are sincere and properly engaged. Besides that, you have nice realization of Him, so why shouldn't He glance upon you lovingly? He does love you, there is no doubt about this. Just go on demonstrating your love for Him by distributing this transcendental literature as you are doing. (August 10, 1987)

If you want to surrender your life fully to the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission, then please, by all means do so, for this is the perfection of life. This <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission is the means to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world where the people are suffering in ignorance due to their lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So please surrender your life to this mission and make it your number one duty. Distribute books, distribute books, distribute books. (May 4, 1991)

You can accomplish a lot in your lifetime for the spreading of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da was so pleased to see his books distributed. He was ecstatic to hear the scores. Other things were nice, but this was the real nectar. If this was not going on, then the other things had no taste. Book distribution is our real mission and nothing else compares to it. There are many different ways to distribute books, so please choose whichever means suits you best. There are many experts there in Germany, so follow in their footsteps. (June 10, 1988)

<p>
I am very happy that you are making <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> with such seriousness and determination. Every week so many letters are coming from the conditioned souls, many of them directly inquiring about how to obtain relief from material existence and take advantage of the mercy of Śrī Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu. If we can become an instrument for assisting the spiritual master in his work of reclaiming the bewildered materialists, then we should have no doubt that we are most fortunate and firmly fixed on the path back to Godhead. You are a nice, intelligent girl, and I would like very much that you dedicate your life's energies to spreading real happiness — spiritual happiness—to everyone. You and the other devotees should take good advantage of the present circumstances, which may end at any moment. So all of you become fixed in knowledge, distribute knowledge, and absorb yourselves more and more in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Books are the basis of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books are more and more distributed, then certainly everything will become successful and auspicious for everyone in due course. (Undated)

It would, of course, be best if you were engaged in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission by directly selling Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. This is the best of all services and the one that will help you advance in spiritual life the quickest. Selling Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books turns you from a neophyte to an advanced devotee, especially if you are always engaging in studying these books at the same time. If you are carefully reading these books and distributing them, your Kṛṣṇa consciousness will expand more and more. Of this there is no doubt. (October 14, 1990)

It is not at all true that you are disconnected with “my mission” if you are in another zone. You are distributing in my BBT zone, and therefore you are still, in a very real sense, in my zone. It makes absolutely no difference to me whether you preach in my GBC zone or my BBT zone. In fact, if you had to, you could live in someone else's zone, and that would also be all right, if you would just go on with the preaching mission. This mission is Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's mission. I have no separate or independent mission, and if you are fulfilling the mission of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da, regardless of where it is, I feel myself successful as a spiritual master. You are engaged in <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and you are serving Kṛṣṇa sincerely. I am pleased by that. It will not please me more if you are living in my GBC zone. This is not at all required. I am trying not to be frui&shy;tive; that is our philosophy, isn't it? You are serving Kṛṣṇa and that is perfection, regardless of where the service is being performed. So please just go on serving Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master nicely wherever you are. That will certainly please me.

Don't worry about what your mind tells you; it is generally all nonsense anyway. Neither worry too much about other speculations as well. Just go on distributing these books and all perfection will come little by little. At least have that faith. (October 6, 1986)

<h3><em>Depend on Kṛṣṇa</em></h3>

</div>
<div id="pp871" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It is wonderful that you are going on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. You should just distribute as much as you can and depend on Kṛṣṇa fully for the results. In this way, you will never be frustrated with the results. However, you should learn from other advanced <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees and learn from them how to distribute more and more. You should distribute perhaps fifty books a day and then you should increase more and more. If you are only doing less per day, that is also all right, but try to do more by learning the technique from other advanced <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees. This will help you more and more. Always try to increase your distribution as this is required in <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Then, when you get to a certain level where it is very hard to do better, you can just keep on distributing at that level for a long time. (June 6, 1992)

<p>
Everything is happening because of the will of the Supreme Lord. He is the controller of all events and He is the en&shy;joy&shy;er of the results. Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, and we must learn to surrender unto Him alone. You are presently too attached to the fruits of your results; therefore, you are unable to distribute much. Perhaps also you do not have the required qualities to be a good distributor.

<div id="pp873" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You will have to learn the art of distribution from other devotees who are already expert at distributing these Kṛṣṇa conscious books. Learn from them humbly, follow in their footsteps, and become expert in this way. You have to learn the art of surrendering yourself to the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. This is not so easy to do when one is not so expert at distribution. First, you have to learn all the techniques of book distribution and then you have to learn the art of surrendering to the mission with all your heart and soul. It is not something that can be done quickly or from one day to the next, but it is something that will build up over longer periods of time, day by day. Therefore, just try to distribute with a straw in your mouth, being very humble and submissive to the will of the Lord, and you will gradually develop your ability more and more. (November 4, 1989)

<div id="pp874" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I can try to give you a small example of what it means to depend on Kṛṣṇa. You might be standing at a distribution place, and there are no people, or you are between people. At that time, you might be praying to the Lord in the heart to help you say just what the people need to hear in order to take a book. A person approaches, and you go to him. As you approach him, you think of Kṛṣṇa—almost as a cry at first, and later, when you are more advanced, as a friend. As your mouth opens to speak, some inspiration might be there and you pick up on it—it might be just what the person needs to hear. Other times you start almost blindly, but with faith that Kṛṣṇa will force you to start speaking the right words. You have to feel His presence through your faith. In other words, you start speaking because you have to, and then you feel inspired to speak in a certain way, you pick up on that inspiration, and continue to speak. If you have the proper faith, you will speak in just the right way, and the Su&shy;per&shy;soul in his heart will help him understand. But please remember that the ultimate choice is his; he might reject all this help from the transcendental Lord, or he might accept it, for whatever reason of his own. In any case we remain fixed in our duty, without attachment to success or failure. For us, that contact with Kṛṣṇa through our service is completely satisfying. Later, when your desire to help these people intensifies, your conviction can force them to take a book, although they might not have wanted to. That is the best platform. A powerful preacher can inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness into the hearts of the fallen souls by his own spiritual potency, of course derived from the mercy of his spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa.

<p>
I am sorry that you are not feeling strong enough to distribute full time. Sometimes some devotees are not as strong as other devotees, and there often is not much that can be done about this. You simply have to go on with your <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> service with as much determination as you can. You should pray to Kṛṣṇa that He will increase your determination, and then when you endeavor He will help you. It is said, “God helps those who help themselves.” So you should depend on Kṛṣṇa fully and try your very best to engage in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement. Do not underestimate the power of prayer. Kṛṣṇa is listening to us, and if our prayers are helpful for our advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, He always answers them. So depend on Kṛṣṇa and try your best. You can do nothing more than that. Then it might be possible that you go out for a longer time each day and in this way increase your results. (June 3, 1991).

<h3><em>Throw Away the Crutches</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp877" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It has become more and more obvious throughout the years that the only method of doing <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> for a long time is to sell the book on the merit of the book itself without using "crutches” of false stories of welfare activities. One may be able to do that for a while, but later on he thinks it is simply parrot-like repetition and wants to do something else. Always present the books for what they are and preach. It will satisfy you more than any other form of distribution.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp878" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Those who are occasional distributors may require mantras, lines, and other crutches to help them out, and that is all right. But the regular saṅ&shy;kīr&shy;ta&shy;ners must be strict and deliver the books for what they are—the highest transcendental knowledge available in the universe. By good preaching and example, one can transform the other's ideas of how to distribute. This is the way it was done in Switzerland and it can also be done there.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp879" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">

The temple president must be the ultimate <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> leader, for without his pushing it and arranging things nicely for <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, how can it go on? But the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> itself may or may not be organized by him directly, for others may be more qualified. But he has to have the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> spirit and dedication. He might not go to international <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> meetings, but he will gladly push on the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> in whatever way he can. If you are the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> leader, then you must organize it properly. The temple president can assist you from his own position. (November 11, 1988)

Do not worry if you are somewhat attached to the result in the beginning. That is natural. But that can go away, after a while, when you realize how flickering is this sense gratification. That comes from doing nicely on book distribution or anything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When you realize that it is not you doing these nice things but Kṛṣṇa, then you become very peaceful and undisturbed, even if everyone is cheering you and shouting your name. All glories go to the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, for it is they who are actually expanding the service more and more. (May 2, 1991)

Your spiritual progress is not exactly attached to the number of books that you are distributing. You can go on making progress, even if the number of books that you distribute is changing. Sometimes it is like that, one day you do more and then you do less. It will change also throughout the year, some months better and some worse. Especially the marathons will be better. If you just go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and dedicate yourself to this service, then you will be happy and satisfied. This determination to engage in <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is developed when you dedicate your life to the mission of the spiritual master. When you see his mission as your mission and you understand that the satisfaction of the spiritual master is the main goal in life, then you can dedicate yourself fully to this <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission.

Please do not be in anxiety. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not meant for being in anxiety, but rather for peacefulness and tranquility. Of course, Arjuna was neither peaceful nor tranquil on the Battlefield of Ku&shy;ru&shy;kṣe&shy;tra, but when he wasn't fighting he was peaceful. So maybe when you are on the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> battlefield, the streets, you may not always be peaceful, but sometimes a kind of calm peace also settles into your life on the streets due to the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

Please do not think that I only care about you when you are doing big on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. I am concerned about your advancement whether you are doing big or not so big. The real point is that you should develop your love for Kṛṣṇa and surrender to Him more and more. Please do not be so frui&shy;tive; it is not good for your spiritual life. Fruit&shy;ive action is only seemingly beneficial for a short while, but in the long run it binds us to the material world. You should act only for the sake of pleasing Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master. When the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa see that you are going out on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> every week year after year, naturally they become very compassionate toward you and give you their mercy. This is the main point that you should remember: The spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa are most impressed with your steadiness of service. So please be steady and determined to surrender to the Lord and you certainly will achieve the desired goal. (January 4, 1991)

<p>
There is nothing wrong with steadily doing the same thing on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> day in and day out for years. This is the symptom of steadiness. You should be satisfied that you are doing steadily, and then you should go out and do what you can do without worrying about the results. The results are not up to you; they are up to Kṛṣṇa. If you are only capable of doing thirty books a day, then so be it and be satisfied. If you can only do ten books a day, then do that and be satisfied. I am satisfied that you are every day going out and trying hard, so you should be satisfied that I am satisfied, because that means that Kṛṣṇa is satisfied and that is good.

Sometimes you will feel better and sometimes you will feel worse. That is the nature of the material world. In this world, one goes up and down all the time. That is natural in this material world. So go on with your devotional service despite the ups and downs of the material world and you will remain happy all the time. This is spiritual happiness. You may not be materially happy, but if you are satisfying your spiritual master, then that is spiritual happiness and that is eternal. Just go on with your <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> program and do not lament for the ups and downs of the material world. Try to surrender to Kṛṣṇa more and more; engage yourself in devotional service more and more; and be happy in this service. It is happiness just to be engaged in devotional service. (June 19, 1991)

It is not required that you be first on the marathons. You may be whatever position you can be in, that does not matter. What matters is that you are going on and serving the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and that this service is gradually getting better and better and that your love for Kṛṣṇa is increasing. The results are up to Kṛṣṇa and not up to us. You just do as best you can and that is good enough. If you come in first, that is the Lord's mercy, and if you come in third, that is the Lord's mercy. But no lower than third. (June 27, 1991)

The next time you find yourself attached to the results of your work, and thus creating a disturbance in your distribution, you should think as follows: "I shall not be attached to the fruits of my labor. I shall not see the people as merely another statistic. I shall look at the next person I meet as a spirit soul requiring my help. I do not even care if he takes a book or not. I only care that he is helped somehow by me. I know that it is best for him to take a book, but it might not be possible due to my contaminated consciousness at present. I pray to Kṛṣṇa that the living entities will take these books for their own benefit.” While praying like this, think of how Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master are pleased when you hand the people these books. Picture how the person will become enlightened by taking home this book and reading it. Thinking like this, you will surely give up the frui&shy;tive mentality. (April 19, 1989)

</div>
<div id="pp889" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
<em>Māyā</em> is also a good warrior in her own right. She creates the frui&shy;tive mentality among our <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> heroes, so that they start thinking that they are the doers of action, which are in actuality carried out either by the material nature or the spiritual nature, depending on the consciousness of the performer; never are these actions created by ourselves alone.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp890" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
During the “normal” year of distribution, you can clearly see that you are not the doer and you are glad to allow Kṛṣṇa to lead people to you. However, during the marathon times you become frui&shy;tive and forget Kṛṣṇa and think that you are a very strong and able <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee; therefore, why can't you do more? I would suggest that you just forget the fact that it is marathon and just go out as you normally do.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp891" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
The marathon aspect should be taken up by others and not by yourself. You are always on marathon. You are always working at peak efficiency-more or less; I mean, you know that you are not giving one hundred percent, but the ninety-five percent that you are giving is quite acceptable. Since you are always engaged nicely in this service, if you try to artificially do more than what you can, you will fall apart and fall in <em>māyā</em>. This is very dangerous, and therefore you should carefully avoid all pretensions and just accept that you can only do what you can and no more, so long as the Lord is not sanctioning your increase. In other words, when Kṛṣṇa wants that you increase, you will, automatically, whether it is marathon or not. Then you will understand that this service is really only depending on Kṛṣṇa and not on you. When you see things like that, you can go on marathon and simply expect that Kṛṣṇa wants you to do more, and therefore, He will arrange that in the same way that He sends people during the “normal” <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> times. In other words, just place yourself in the arms of Kṛṣṇa and He will arrange everything. That means that you should still endeavor by going out and meeting the people, but for the results, you should simply surrender to Kṛṣṇa and see what He wants from you. (March 23, 1989)

I am pleased that you are doing distribution and preaching steadily throughout all these years. You may not be doing a lot of distribution, and you may not be doing it with the perfect consciousness of compassion toward the conditioned souls, but at least you are doing it and that pleases me. You can please me more by developing the proper consciousness in distribution and engaging yourself more purely in devotional service, that is a fact. So please just continue with your service as you have been doing steadily for years now, and try to develop a more compassionate understanding of the people on the street. I can understand that it is difficult, because the people are so foolish sometimes, but if you keep reading Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books, you will start to see them with a transcendental eye and you will understand that they are following the dictations of the three modes of material nature. If you give them Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then they will advance beyond the influence of the modes and become transcendental. It is up to you to give them a chance to advance beyond the lower modes of nature and to taste a bit of the higher platform of spiritual life. Please just go on with this <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission and just by doing it, however imperfectly, you will please me and Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da. (November 3, 1991)

Regarding the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men's feeling of frustration at not being able to freely express themselves as devotees—I think that problem was solved by their doing some street chanting each week and short distribution. That should be sufficient to overcome that feeling. But they should not fall into the trap thinking that there is some service that is higher than this street book distribution. No one should ever forget for a moment that this is the most important method of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness and no other method is as important. One who is distributing books is simply paving his way back to the spiritual world. (November 12, 1980)

Single-minded intelligence means that you are determined to execute the instructions of the spiritual master without deviation.

As a general rule, I think that it is better that you remain on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> until you absolutely cannot go further. Then you can take up these other programs one after another. In the meantime, you should fix your mind on the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission and not be disturbed with other ideas. The <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission is our life and soul and it should not be disturbed by mental speculation. This is a problem with many devotees. They are already doing the highest service, and then they want to do something else that completely destroys their determination to do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Please do not become a devotee like that. You are already doing the nicest <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and often you are the top distributor, so please do not change that for doing some other program. When you are older and cannot do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> anymore, then you can do many programs and we shall be happy to see you preaching in that way.

At least you should do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> during these years, while you are still young enough, because later on when you will get older it will be very difficult to continue. Older devotees cannot go on distributing in the same manner and they generally take to managerial positions. So I would suggest that when the BBT service is finished, that you continue with <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> until you cannot do it anymore and that will help you in your endeavor to become purified. Otherwise, you will have to stay around the temple and always be disturbed because of this and that problem with overcrowded devotees. (July 16, 1990)

It is not good to be so mental on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is a service that mainly utilizes the heart.

To properly go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, there must be a certain peace and balance in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee. This can be attained over longer periods when one is advancing in devotional service. Sometimes a devotee is immature and when he goes on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> it is difficult for him. But when a devotee is mature, then he can easily approach people and naturally be compassionate toward them and give them Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. When you understand that the distribution of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books is the means to change the world and make a revolution in the hearts of the misguided mankind, then you can distribute with determination. If you have that revolutionary fervor to change the world and make it a better place to live in, then you become eager to distribute our books. These books are the key to success in spiritual life; therefore, you should be eager to get them in the hands of the materialistic people who have no understanding of spiritual life. This understanding can grow in you as you advance and mature in devotional service. So please advance more and more in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; then gradually, your appreciation of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> will increase and you will become a mature and advanced devotee. This may take some time, so just go on and naturally it will come. (July 8, 1992)

I become enlivened just by hearing of your <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> results. This makes me most inspired. It is nice to see how much every devotee is doing.

It is wonderful to hear that the people (at least some of them) are interested to hear about Kṛṣṇa and the soul. This is because they are naturally His servants, otherwise why would they have this interest? I would also be happy if you would devote yourself to full-time <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, but then how would everything go on? You can do the needful, whatever is required to be done, whenever you get a chance. But the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is the most important mission. (July 6, 1985)

Kṛṣṇa is pleased with a manager who does the needful and He always protects such a devotee. Kṛṣṇa will be pleased with you, and also I am pleased that Kṛṣṇa is pleased, when you are doing the service that must be done in a nice way. It is not that only book production or distribution pleases me; any service done with faith and love and devotion pleases me. I am pleased with the temple managers, who take care of things even though there are so many problems. It is much harder to be a temple president than to be a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee, and therefore, the temple president gets a lot of mercy from the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa when he does his job nicely.

It is all right if you cannot do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. You can still surrender to the Lord and become Kṛṣṇa conscious doing <em>pū&shy;jā&shy;rī</em> work. Please do it with devotion. You may also serve the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees by cooking and cleaning for them and helping them. Not everyone is qualified to do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and some, after trying it for a long time, cannot succeed. So then take up some other work and be happy with that work for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa accepts all work, although the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> work satisfies Him quickly and very quickly brings His mercy to you. But you will also get His mercy in due course of time by serving Him nicely on the altar. So do it nicely and be happy. (May 15, 1992)

I think it is fine that you are cooking and then one week a month going out on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Both services are very much needed, and it is wonderful that you are able to get away at least one week a month and go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>.

Yes, cooking or doing anything in the temple is difficult, since it is easier to be attacked by <em>māyā</em> in the temple where everything is so nice and easier than on the street. On the street one is more peaceful from the material desires than in the temple. But on the street there is another form of austerity, and the temple has its own form of austerity, so you should surrender to your service in the kitchen. Perform it as an austerity and make greater advancement doing that service. And for a relief you will go out on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> one week a month. That is very nice. I do not think that you have anything to worry about. (September 15, 1991)

Also you can train the <em>bhak&shy;tas</em> in the temple for two months and then, when they are ready, send them out on full time traveling <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> or out from the temple selling books. Every new devotee can go out and sell books, after a training program of a few months in the temple, learning in a <em>bhak&shy;ta</em> program.

Generally most new devotees should stay in the temple at least two months before attempting to go out on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> with books. Of course, they can go out on the chanting party from the first day in the temple, since that is blissful. They should start book distribution gradually, going out with an older devotee every day from the temple and learning what to do. Then after a few days of learning, they can do it on their own near an older devotee. Then when they can stand on their own two feet, they are ready for traveling <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. This is the general rule, but there are of course exceptions; some may be faster and some may be slower to go out on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. (May 15, 1990)

I am also glad that you are doing better on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Do not be attached to the results. Just go out every day and try the best you can. Every <em>bhak&shy;ta</em> and <em>bhak&shy;tin</em> should do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> for purification for at least two years. Then, if you have not surrendered to it by then, you can do other services that are also needed. But for now, just surrender to the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission and just do it every day steadily. It does not matter whether you are doing big one day and bad another; what counts is that you are serving with love and devotion. So just go out and do not worry about the results. The results will depend on Kṛṣṇa and He will grant you the results as He desires. (July 13, 1991)

I have previously demanded that the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees have the morning programs and that they read at least one hour each day if not more. They must never eat food prepared outside. They should get bread from the temple and they can cook something for themselves with a stove and a pressure cooker. They should get to rest early and rise properly. They may take seven hours of rest a day (or more if they need it). If one comes and is not very serious, then he should become serious through a study of the philosophy. Then he may become qualified to go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>.

I do not think that it is good that you go out at 6 a.m. and stay out till 8 or 9 p.m. This is too long—maybe not in the marathon times, but normally. You will burn yourself out both materially and spiritually by doing that. You should chant all or most of your rounds before you go out in the morning and you should also have <em>kīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and read Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books as well. Best would be that you read one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. You must study these books and get out of the mode of passion. You can then go out around 8 a.m. and stay out for ten hours with the break for lunch. If you follow your program of fourteen hours a day of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, you will not last for long.

If you read more and have a proper morning program, then you will not be attached to the results of your work.

You seem to be very much situated in the mode of passion. Then naturally you will be attached to the results. You should elevate yourself to the mode of goodness and work without attachment for the results. Then you will never be frustrated. Frustration is a symptom of the mode of passion or ignorance. Please rise above these modes and be situated transcendentally without attachment. Please study Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books and develop your spiritual intelligence.

So you have your ups and downs on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>? So you are not a pure devotee yet? So you sometimes have a fall&shy;down? So what to do? I do not really understand the problem. Do you think that anyone is free from problems? As long as you are in the material world there will be problems. You are no exception. We have to tolerate. Toleration is the key to success—<em>tāṁs ti&shy;ti&shy;kṣa&shy;sva bhā&shy;ra&shy;ta</em>. Tolerate and gradually you will develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness and not fall down. Do not get discouraged because you are sometimes weak; just keep trying and this will give strength over longer periods of time. Stop trying to be a perfected devotee immediately.

It is not "wrong” to ask why you are having problems on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. It is not against any Kṛṣṇa conscious principle. You may ask; however, asking might not be the most advantageous way to solve the problem. Even if you know that you are having a particular problem, the solution to all problems is the same; that is, you should surrender fully to Kṛṣṇa and pray to Him for His mercy, so that you can overcome the problem. Therefore, when there are problems it is advised to immediately go to the point of depending on Kṛṣṇa and asking Him to help you, instead of wasting time in deep psychoanalysis, trying to find out the various ins and outs of the particular problem you are presently experiencing.

Sometimes it might help if you understood your problem better, so that you can avoid in the future going down the same path that put you in the same problematic situation in the first place. From that point of view, it is important to know why you have fall&shy;downs and why you become disturbed. If you know why these things happen to you, then you will avoid doing those same things in the future, and this will help your spiritual life. In conclusion, it is sometimes good to know why some bad thing is happening to you, but not all the time, and basically on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> one should just depend on Kṛṣṇa all the time and pray for His mercy. And don't forget that all the <em>anar&shy;thas</em> in our hearts are the real cause for loss of enthusiasm, because as we become enthusiastic for material life we lose our enthusiasm for spiritual life.

<em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is sometimes difficult. Sometimes one does really well, especially in the beginning, but then, as the time goes on, it gets harder. This is a test from Kṛṣṇa to see how determined you are. Every <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee has gone through this test. It always comes at one point. Therefore, you should remain on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and do it with great determination. Do not give up. Just try harder and harder to get the books into the hands of the people to save them from the miserable condition of material life. Only the devotees can save them, yet they are so foolish that they do not know that. Therefore, you are doing the greatest welfare work. You should never think that there is some other service that you should do. There is nothing more important than this <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement.

You may not be able to continue on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> if you are materially engrossed. But this is a temporary state and can be quickly changed by taking a little vacation for a few days, hearing, chanting, and serving within the protected environment of the temple. If this is necessary, it should be done (not whimsically, however, for that will make us weaker and sicker if overused). Then when the raging senses calm down, then we can again battle <em>māyā</em> with strength. It is not easy to continue on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> like this without having the realization that we are doing a service that is most pleasing to the Supreme Lord, most important for the saving of the fallen souls, and the only means of even continuing our own devotional advancement. No one can continue in Kṛṣṇa consciousness without having the preaching spirit. Unless we are concerned with the spiritual advancement of others and work to help them spiritually, we will not have the energy, will, or strength to continue ourselves. Therefore, the most advanced devotees never relax or give up their preaching services; they have made it their life's work. (July 10, 1981)

It is sometimes true that one may temporarily have trouble owing to the nature of the material body. Our bodies are lusty and lazy; therefore, there are troubles to go out and do things for the sake of others. <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is a completely selfless service and one that is best done by those without any personal motivation. Of course, it is also possible that one can do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> with personal motivation, but it is not so blissful. If you are truly having problems to do that service, then you can also make a vacation by taking over the cooking duties from those in the temple, for example, and let them go out on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>.

Read Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books every day for a minimum of two hours (ABSOLUTELY!) and engage the rest of the day in devotional service, according to the advice of the temple president. This will help you. Then, when the break is over, again take up this <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> service with determination. I think that this should take care of the problem nicely. Do not worry.

If you require more rest after marathons, then take it. Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da used to say, “If you are tired, take rest; if you are hungry, eat.” In this way, we satisfy the demands of the body, but not overly. After you have worked so hard to satisfy Kṛṣṇa during the marathon times, you deserve some break and a rest. Do not feel guilty in taking it. However, this should not go on forever, since it will degrade into the mode of ignorance. You must learn to judge for yourself how long you require to rest and then break it off when it is becoming sense gratification. I think that you can do this.

Sometimes it is difficult to continue <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>.

Therefore, you have to directly counteract this <em>māyā</em> by carefully engaging in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission despite this disturbance. You have to tolerate these disturbing conditions and become very fixed in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission.

To answer your question about distribution during colder or wetter days, I can simply say that any place that is legal, or at least not going to get you or the movement in too much trouble, and where it is possible to distribute is fine. There are no restrictions as to where you can distribute these wonderful books of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da. Some devotees only go to these places. It is purely a matter of taste and of legality. Sometimes it gets one in great trouble to go into these offices or shops, but in other places there is no problem at all. So you all there in Finland know your own country far better than I. Therefore, you can all decide on your own where to distribute and where not to. I am not at all qualified to say.

Even if the book is somewhat esoteric, like the <em>Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya-ca&shy;ri&shy;tā&shy;mṛ&shy;tas</em>, for example, the person who gets the book is benefited, simply because he has touched it and paid a donation for it.

I recommend for <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees a stay in India not longer than three weeks, even if they have not been to India for five years, and in some cases, where the devotees might get sick or are liable to get spaced out, two weeks.

We do not have tourism in spiritual life. They should always go under authorized programs. The best program is one week in Maya&shy;pur, one week in Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na, and some days transiting either Bombay or Delhi.

It is Kṛṣṇa conscious to accept things as they come without your asking for them and also to ask the temple to supply you with something you need, if you are giving all your collection to the temple.

For example, if you want to go to India for the festival one year and you have no other means of getting a ticket, you can ask the temple president to let you keep a percentage of your collection, which is over the normal collection for the temple, or allow you to do something else which is agreeable to you both.

This is the duty of the temple president. The temple president might arrange that the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees make a special collection just for the cars, but that is up to him.

It is not exactly a material desire to want a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> van to do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> with. But I think that such a decision, whether to collect for a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> van or not, should be made by your temple president. Since you are here now in Germany, you should discuss this with your temple president. I think that it is not required, and you should just depend on your authorities, wherever you are, to tell you when it is required to collect for a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> van.

It is good to distribute a lot of books for the satisfaction of Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya and the spiritual master. All spiritual authorities become pleased when you distribute a lot of books. It is not good to think that you are the doer of this service and that it is to your credit that you are distributing so many books. You should understand that it is the credit of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is actually the one who is distributing these books and all credit should go to Him. Never take credit yourself for anything that has gone on in the past, and you will live happily beyond all material desires. (September 15, 1991)

I am very glad to hear that you are dedicated to rebuilding the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission there in France. However, you should get in the practice to distribute the books for twice the BBT price, so that the temple authorities will see book distribution as a viable means of supporting the temple economically. <em>Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is a good means to support the temple and it is the means which Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da wanted ISKCON to use to support the temples, so you can also do like that.

I think that in your letter you yourself have come up with a very nice solution to the problem which you, and perhaps others, are facing. That is, to always go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> together with others. I have also personally distributed with both methods, alone and with others. Although there is a certain type of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> ecstasy that comes when one is alone and completely depending on Kṛṣṇa, I would still prefer to go with one other. We used to perform <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> on the subway trains in New York this way: one devotee on each end of the train meeting in the middle.

There is strength in numbers. When one must go alone all the time, that is gradually weakening one. It is generally better to go with others as much as possible. If you are alone, then your mind takes over and starts to speculate. But when you are with others, it is much harder for the mind to do that, and therefore, it does not like the idea of you going with others and it rebels. Therefore, there is initially some trouble in this system. However, this can be overcome if you try to stick to it for some time. Please continue your service nicely and things will definitely get better. This seems to be a test from Kṛṣṇa, but certainly you can pass it. (May 30, 1986)

<h3><em>Real Renunciation</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp959" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I do know that the major activity for preaching in Los Angeles is book distribution. The distribution of the transcendental literature of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da is considered by spiritual authorities to be the highest form of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Indeed, it was the way in which you became interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness! So you can have practical realization of the potency of this mission.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp960" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Throughout the world, this movement in its various affiliated branches distributes many millions of books. This is a very big venture. Sometimes we cannot collect back the printing cost of these books, since the people of Kali are so unfortunate and impious that they cannot even see fit to properly donate enough for the books. It is obvious that because of this, some temples might be forced to subsidize their book distribution by either doing some business or perhaps by asking people to donate for other things.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp961" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Of course, such activities seen by themselves could be taken to be materialistic, but when seen in relationship to the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> means of distributing books, it is a perfectly spiritual activity. Certainly such distribution, when simply done to further one's own bodily maintenance or further one's own opu&shy;len&shy;ces, is not very spiritual, and this type of activity is to be avoided according to the instructions of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp962" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
There is a verse in Rūpa Go&shy;svā&shy;mī's writings that speaks about real renunciation. He says that simply renouncing something because it seems to be material is not sufficient renunciation, it is false renunciation. And after all, almost everything that we deal with in the world can be seen as material, since this world is a product of the external potency of the Lord, <em>māyā</em>. So where do you find spirit in this world of material names and forms? Through spiritual practice and advancement one can see the spiritual energy working everywhere, but when one becomes advanced, he will see that everything is usable in the service of the Lord by one with the pure spiritual motive to please. We do not use everything that exists in Kṛṣṇa's service, since there are many things that are exceedingly impure and unusable for us. But we can say that there are many things that can be used without compromising our spiritual principles.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp963" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
For example, one cannot build a temple of Kṛṣṇa with good intentions only. It would be wonderful if we could simply go on the street, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and people would come forward desirous of building a temple for Kṛṣṇa, but alas, it is only a dream at this point. In this modern world of opulence and material enjoyment, if one is a spiritual beggar, he is not listened to! It is sad, I know, but that is the fact. People only stand up and take notice of you when you have something wonderful to present to them. Books are certainly the most wonderful thing, but some people are just dull and cannot appreciate them. For that class of men—perhaps eighty percent of the population, if not more—wonderful temples and dioramas are the key to bringing them closer to Kṛṣṇa.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp964" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Therefore, the best preaching program is one that nicely balances the need to distribute a mountain of transcendental literature, and the need to create wonderful temples for people to see. To this end, some temples have had to resort to other propositions rather than just straight book distribution and chanting on the street. Of course, this program is risky and perhaps some have forgotten about the books, but certainly not all. (Undated)

It is very nice that you are enthusiastic about book <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. It is the actual mission started by Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da. Doing paraphernalia is not <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, but a business activity. Because it is helping to maintain the temple, it is also devotional service, but it is not <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Therefore, you may go on and perform your devotional service as you have been requested by your temple authorities, but always try to engage in book distribution as much as possible as well, for this is the life of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

<h3><em>Farm Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na<br /></em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp967" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Farms are not really a place for new <em>bhak&shy;tas</em> and <em>brah&shy;ma&shy;cā&shy;rīs</em>. Farms are meant for householders. The brah&shy;ma&shy;cā&shy;rīs and especially the <em>bhak&shy;tas</em> are meant to go to the city centers on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. This is why you are having so many troubles there. Your farm is not really what it should be. Maybe there can be some <em>brah&shy;ma&shy;cā&shy;rīs</em> there on the farm, but they will be the type of person who can neither do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> nor wants to. He would rather be on the farm. That is the best thing; to have on the farm only those who really want to be there. You should also have a traveling <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> party that works out from the farm or from the nearest city where book distribution can take place. In this way, you can engage devotees according to their propensity. According to their qualities and activities, they should be engaged and then they can be happy. It is not good to try to push them into a certain mode of action if they are not fit for it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp968" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
So at your farm you should have a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> party that travels and sells books. I think that there are enough books now to insure that they have something to distribute. All those devotees who want to do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> should go on the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> party, and whoever doesn't want to go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> should stay back and work in the temple and the farm. We would never, at least in the West, force a person who wants to do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> to serve in the farm or in the temple, for that is completely against all principles of <em>var&shy;ṇā&shy;śra&shy;ma</em> management. Besides, it is against the principles of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> management. Since we are a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement, every available man and woman, who wants to be engaged in the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement, should be given facility to distribute books and preach to the people.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp969" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
But we should not fill our temples up with useless neophytes, who are not at all fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. We should also take some time to train the new devotees. But new devotees should be trained in a city center, not a farm. The way in which devotees should get to the farm is as follows: First a person joins in the city center. He learns from a <em>bhak&shy;ta</em> program in the city and simultaneously he goes on the chanting party in the city and learns how to distribute <em>pra&shy;sā&shy;dam</em>, magazines, and small books with the chanting party. A little later, when he is more fixed up—perhaps in two to four months time, depending on the person—he will join the full-time <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> for some years until he learns the art of preaching well. He remains on the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> party for as long as he can. Perhaps later on he will want to come and work on the farm, and he can do so, after he has done his <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> duty, like one must do his military duty in the <em>kar&shy;mī</em> world. Also there are some who are not fit for <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. They are not good at it and some don't want to do it either. They can move to the farm right away. You see, we send people to the farm when it is seen that they cannot do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. We give everyone a chance to do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, since that is the most important service, but those who cannot do it go to the farm. This balances the population of devotees out nicely after a while, and it also makes sure that no one at the farm feels frustrated. The farm should only expand with these members of ISKCON who are voluntarily joining the farm community.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp970" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
It is also possible that sometimes a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotee would rather be associated with the farm than the city center. They are interested in the farm, but they would rather do <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. Such devotees should go on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> from the farm and return to the farm during the weekends. In this way, they can feel part of the farm community and the farm development, yet at the same time they can feel that they are part of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> movement, which is the most important service.

<h3><em>Dedication to the Mission</em></h3>

It is essential that you attract people to this movement not by tricks or by the force of your so-called intellect but by your pure and dedicated example. One sincere preacher is worth a hundred <em>jñān&shy;īs</em>. Please dedicate your life to spreading this movement more and more.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp973" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Never forget that the goal of this movement is to produce and distribute Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books. Practically this is our most important work. This requires manpower, not just someone to fill up the <em>bhak&shy;ta</em> pants, but someone who is dedicated to the mission of his spiritual master. To attract such a high quality of man, you have to yourself be the same quality. This is difficult, but well worth the struggle. (October 10, 1984)
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp974" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Some devotees lose their taste for book distribution, because they have allowed their material desires to overwhelm them and they have decided to enjoy some material facility instead. This comes sometimes with age as well. When one gets older, he wants to have more material facilities. This is called material attachment. One has to conquer that with spiritual detachment attained through knowledge of devotional service as it is given by Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da in his books.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp975" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
You should not push or force anyone to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but rather convince them through the philosophy. Proper preaching about book distribution should be enough to persuade them to surrender to it nicely. You can inspire others to distribute books by doing it yourself and being happy about it. This is the best way that you can serve book distribution.

If you are on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> and every day attending the morning programs, it is not always required that you attend the evening programs in the temple and it is probably better that you read as you have suggested. You must read Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books and learn our philosophy completely. (March 19, 1992)

<h3><em>How to Preach Saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp978" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
This point about book distribution preaching is very important. I have heard your class when you were here in Kors&shy;näs over the speaker system. I thought it was a good class. There were some points that could be mentioned that might help you understand more about the problem of preaching in a temple about the urgency and importance of book distribution.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp979" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When you were speaking about the transferal of the books from Vṛn&shy;dā&shy;va&shy;na to Na&shy;va&shy;dvī&shy;pa, that was nice. It was a means by which the importance of the books could be emphasized without overdoing it. Just consider: Sometimes I very clearly speak about book distribution. I do not do it so very often, since the basis for this understanding has been nicely established in this zone.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp980" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
When I do it, I do it clearly and strongly. There is no doubt what we are talking about. I usually do this when there is a need due to some degradation of the book distribution spirit. In other times, when things are going as well as could naturally be expected, I do not hammer home this point again. In fact, such overemphasizing a point can work against one.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp981" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
For example, if one continuously preaches in class that one should follow the principles, gradually no one will be interested in the class since it is the same thing. Furthermore, due to the rebellious nature of the psychology of the conditioned souls, some of them might even think that they don't want to have anything to do with it. Do you understand? If there is no need to push something, then pushing it can have the exactly opposite effect than the one that is wanted.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp982" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
For example, in your class you were directly pushing <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> as one would normally do in a <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> class. Consider the audience. There were some <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> men there who already knew about the need to do it, since they were doing it already. There are also a majority of BBT devotees who do nothing but make books all day. They are not distributing the books, but making the books. This is their life and soul. Then there are a small handful of temple devotees who support everyone else and who also cannot sell books. So the point of the class, although nice, was lost on most of the people, since they were either already totally absorbed in the service or they could not do it due to supporting it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp983" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Such devotees would like to hear about Kṛṣṇa. So it was nice that you told them the story, which was related to book distribution, yet was a pastime of the devotees of Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya Ma&shy;hā&shy;pra&shy;bhu. The real point in preaching is that one has to learn how to attract someone's mind to Kṛṣṇa and then, when the person understands Kṛṣṇa's glories and can appreciate the knowledge, you gradually reveal that it is all Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's mercy that comes from these books. Naturally, when one understands the importance of the books through study of the books, he will also want to sell the books as well. This is a natural consequence of good preaching. It is subtle in many respects, but it is more powerful, since it works on the level of intelligence. One should bring the hearers to the point of them making their own minds up about the importance of the books, rather than attempting to program them to think in that manner. I think this is what I have tried to do. Now you have to learn the art as well.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp984" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
I can be much more direct among my own disciples, since this is the direct order of the spiritual master. However, you are not the <em>guru</em>; therefore, you cannot be so direct as I sometimes am. You have to be more subtle in the presentation to avoid getting anyone upset.
</p>
</div>
<div id="pp985" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph agttsd">
<p>
Speak about Kṛṣṇa, and attract people to hear about Kṛṣṇa. Naturally you will bring them also to the books. One who is totally convinced about something does not need to continuously wave it about. For him it is second nature. Be convinced yourself and sure, then there is a good chance that others will become infected with your realization. (June 27, 1988)

Your stories of the glories of distribution are very nice, and I pray to Kṛṣṇa that He empowers you more and more with His full mercy to preach. We do not care about big numbers.

My initial experience with <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> was on the streets of New York City, doing <em>Back to Godhead</em> magazines with the <em>ha&shy;ri&shy;nā&shy;ma</em> party. This was the only form of <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> at the time. Later on, I was with the old “Road Show," and we continued the sale of <em>Back to Godhead</em> on the street, as well as selling a few <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books at some programs. In the spring of 1972 I went to India, where I was engaged by Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da in selling books through the life membership program, which I did for some time. Later on, I returned to New York for a short time and also distributed from the temple on the subways and the malls.

I have always understood from the first days on the street the extreme importance of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. Without performing <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>, no devotee can be happy. Real happiness comes when one is connected with Lord Cai&shy;ta&shy;nya by pleasing Him through the performance of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na-yajña</em>.

Sometimes neophyte <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> devotees become somewhat discouraged in their service because of having insufficient knowledge as to what is the point of their service. One has to know our whole philosophy quite well and then he can understand the importance of the <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> mission. It is not really an engagement for the ignorant, but is mainly meant for those who have a thorough understanding of the process of devotional service. Therefore, all your doubts and difficulties could be answered if you were to systematically study Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books while you are on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em>. One of the reasons why the devotees in my zone are so steady on <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is that they all read Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da's books at least two hours a day, and that gives them the strength to go on in this service forever. Hear lectures by Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da and read his books. Take shelter of those who have taken shelter of Śrī&shy;la Pra&shy;bhu&shy;pā&shy;da, and you will never be at a loss what to do in spiritual life.

It is a fact that your sincerity will be tested before you can attain the platform of steadiness. Sometimes Kṛṣṇa will allow you to distribute a lot in one day, and the next day, after you have profoundly congratulated yourself, you do next to nothing. This kind of up and down is a type of test given by the Lord. Initially, He will inspire you with a big success, and you may think, “Oh, this is easy!” but the very next day you will find out that it is not so easy as you thought. Actually <em>saṅkīr&shy;ta&shy;na</em> is neither hard nor easy, rather it is an austerity like all services and it must be met with determination and conviction. (March 7, 1990)
