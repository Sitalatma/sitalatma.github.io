<h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy
ṃonkeys</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 30<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br><p class="txt">Rama's exaltation of <font color="#B3003A">sharad ṛitu</font> post-rainy or pre-autumnal season is the theme here. This season, which
will be conducive to lovers, is painful to Rama in the absence of Seetha. This agony is compounding and turning into his ire, since Sugreeva's
efforts in searching for Seetha are neither seen nor heard. Hence, Rama sends Lakshmana as an envoy to Kishkindha to decide whether Sugreeva's
support is there or liquefied in the spree of his drinking and merrymaking.</p>
<p class="tat">
A word about this chapter. Readers acquainted with critical version of Ramayana may find some 35 verses in this chapter that are
unknown to them. They occur in all the other traditional versions and they carry the blemish of interpolation. They are inescapable in traditional
versions, as age-old commentators have commented on them at length.</p>

too is being lost irretrievably, and thus he became highly impatient and even swooned. [4-30-1, 2, 3]</p>
