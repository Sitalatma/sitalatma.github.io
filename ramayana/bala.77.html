Again this &#39;receiving bride&#39; is an elaborate variety of fun and games of womenfolk will take place, at which place there 
is almost no entry to men. For example, name telling. An Indian bride, or the later time wife is supposed to not to call 
her husband by his name. It is a sacred taboo, and her addressing shall be in genderless, person-less, and numberless hooting, 
cooing or calling like <em>e jī - o jī - emanDī - ennango - shuniye</em> so on. To cite one such ceremony it is &#39;naming 
game.&#39; Here the bride is compelled to tell the name of her husband, and she will be hesitating to do so, because of her 
newness to this house or to her husband. After some teasing attempts, she mutters her husband&#39;s name, and then only she 
will be admitted into certain chamber or room. But dwindling are these games, and dampening is that fun, in these days of 
readymade marriages. Then why Dasharatha shall be overjoyed at these womanly functions, they do all those womanish things... 
because, Dasharatha wanted his palace to be in festivity, with just one son. But four are forced on him and they too obtained 
four brides in one go, hence fourfold is his happiness. It may be observed that Kaikeyi is the lone queen with &#39;beauty&#39; 
as her attribute, and the problem with her is seeded here alone, saying that enchantment of Dasharatha towards her outweighs 
his affection to Rama, later.</p>
