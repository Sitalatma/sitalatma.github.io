<p class="comment">The text varies with other mms. <em>kratu madhye upa nītām</em> will change to
<em>kratu madhye apa nītām</em> in ṃaheshvara Tīrtha's version, then it translates as 'an animal
led out of the ritual half way through the ritual...' meaning that 'the animal unbefitting for
sacrifice...' And that is to say 1] an animal not prearranged and sanctified right from the
beginning, but brought in the middle of ritual; 2] or, one that is brought for ritual which has to
yield without being aggressive <em>pratikāra hīna shakti</em>; 3] or, <em>paryagni kṛitā na
araṇyām utsṛijyam a himsāyā</em> 'unsanctified or wild animals brought from wilds are to be let
off, unhurt...' 4] or, one that which is not at the sacrificial post - it is not to be
sacrificed...' and Lakshmana says addressing Rama as 'oh, king, you have to let off those beasts,
but not this beastly demon who is aggressive and contemplating a regicide...'</p>

<p class="comment">This compound <em>su sam hṛiṣṭau</em> is as per the text of Govindaraja and
ṃaheshvara Tīrtha states this as <em>su sam vignau</em> meaning 'very highly agitated...' agitated
at the short time available to cut off his hands, before falling into his well-head like mouth. And
this expression 'very highly gladdened' is for the righteous advice given by Lakshmana,
circumspectly.</p>
