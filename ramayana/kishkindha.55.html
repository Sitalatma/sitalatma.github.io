<h3>Book IV . Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy Monkeys</h3>
<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 55<br>Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>

<p class="txt">
Monkeys decide to fast unto death as they failed in executing Sugreeva command. Sugreeva already said that anyone 
returning after timeframe might deem himself as dead. Thus, Angada casting aspersions on Sugreeva and his ruthless 
commands, takes this decision on many counts. All the other monkeys follow the suite.</p>

the mouth of the cavity to fightback the demon Dundubhi if he tries to escape, all the more when his own brother

<p class="comment">
For this statement Hanuma may retort saying &#39;Sugreeva has not overlooked Rama but otherwise engrossed in material 
comforts. He sent all of us all over to search for Seetha in requital to the help rendered by Rama... is it not 
the upright conduct of Sugreeva?&#39; For that Angada is ready with an answer as.</p>

act of eliminating my father, and unmindful of tradition in usurping my mother and throne, and unthankful in requiting 
Rama by himself, instead of using us as pawns, and changeful in ignoring his promise to Rama, but in fearing for 
Lakshmana? Will it be possible especially for one like me belonging to his family? [4-55-7]</p>

<em>maam katham jiivayiSyati</em> = me, how, let live.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;Whether a son is honest or dishonest he alone is investable in the kingdom. How then can Sugreeva let me, the 
one from the family of his enemy, live on? [4-55-8]</p>

<p class="comment">
This is in reply to Hanuma&#39;s advise, &#39;he establishes you only in kingdom, as before...&#39; as at 4-54-20. But Hanuma 
cannot rebut Angada for he has no valid proof to show to Angada about Sugreeva&#39;s goodness towards Angada, as sermonised 
by Hanuma in the earlier chapter. Hence, &#39;better to follow the leader, than to argue...&#39; is the only option left 
to Hanuma.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;My slyness in planning to live in Black Hole has backfired, I am now culpable in not finding Seetha being the

Kishkindha, like caitiff turned into a wretch. [4-55-9]</p>

Those best ones among fly-jumpers on discerning the words of Angada, the son of Vali, and agreeing to what all 
said by Angada as appropriate, they positioned themselves on the sacred grass after touching waters sacramentally. 
The sacred-grass is spread as sacred beds to cast off their lives. The edges of grass blades are positioned southward. 
As they are on that northern shore of southern ocean, all those best monkeys who are bent on to self-immolation, 
they became recumbent facing eastward. [4-55-19b, 21a]</p>

<p class="comment">
Here Maheshvara Tiirtha says that &#39;an apprehensive dread swept over them subconsciously...&#39; not because of the 
past episodes, but due to some future events, where their becoming pray to some unknown carnivore, namely Sampaati, 
is apprehended. Thus, their fasting unto death, as per scriptural sanction is going to fail.</p>
