<h3> VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of
<br>
chapter [Sarga] 94<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">The female-demons lament over the death of their husbands and kinsfolk in battle. They further rebuke Surpanakha, for being the prime
cause to bring Seetha to Lanka forcibly by Ravana and for all the combat occurring with Rama thereafter. The female-demons feel sad that Ravana did
not heed to the appropriate advice given by Vibhishana. They further lament on perceiving bad omens and predict the annihilation of Ravana. They
recollect an instance of celestials praying for Shiva and getting a boon that a woman (Seetha) will be born to cause the destruction of demons.</p>
