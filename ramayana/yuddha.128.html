<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 128<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">At the request of Bharata to take back the kingdom of Ayodhya, Rama accepts the offer and sits on a seat. Bharata and Rama take their
bath and get adorned for the occasion. Rama, mounting on an excellent chariot, sallies forth on a procession in the city accompanied by Bharata,
Shatrughna, Lakshmana and Vibhishana. Nine thousand elephants follow the procession, with Sugreeva and other monkeys mounted on them. Some attendants
and musicians with their musical instruments walk in front of Rama's procession. The citizens of Ayodhya host flags on every house. Rama returns to
his paternal palace in Ayodhya. Sugreeva orders four of his monkeys to bring water from four oceans in jars given to them. Some monkeys brought water
from five hundred rivers, as also from the four oceans for the purpose of the ceremony. Vasishta along with other brahmins as priests caused Rama to
be consecrated with that water. The virgins, ministers, warriors, merchants, the four gods as well as other gods sprinkled sap of all kinds of herbs
on Rama. Vasishta and other priests officiating the coronation-ceremony adorned Rama with an auspicious and charming crown. Then, Rama gives away
presents to the priests as well as Sugreeva and Angada. Rama presents a pearl-necklace to Seetha and Seetha presents that necklace in turn to Hanuma.
Rama further gives away presents to Vibhishana, Sugreeva, Jambavan and others on the occasion. Rama bids farewell to monkeys. The glory of the epic
is complemented in the end by Valmiki.</p>
