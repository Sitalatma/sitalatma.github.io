Jute-cloths that are befitting to sages and saints are brought in for the three at the behest of Kaikeyi. Rama and Lakshmana accept
and wear them. But Seetha, as a par excellent princess of ṃithila, is baffled in wearing them and when she is irksome as how to tie and toggle them,
Rama goes to her and demonstrates how to wear them, on her silken robes. Seeing that situation, all the womenfolk in the palace chamber wail for the
hardship befallen on Seetha.</p>
