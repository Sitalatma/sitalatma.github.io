<p class="comment">
The words <em>pradāsyate putravantam</em> are read in some translations as &#39;Rishyasringa 
who already has a son...&#39; while others read it as &#39;a sage who endows progeny by <em>putra 
kameṣṭi</em> ritual...&#39; But in ṃaha Bharata father Vibhandaka says to Rishyasringa to comeback 
after begetting a son, which Rishyasringa did not concede. So taking this some say Rishyasringa 
has a son. But it is generally accepted that <em>putravantam</em> as <em>āhitāgni</em>, 
Vedic ritualist of eminence, according to: <em>jāta putraḥ kṛishṇa kesho 
agnīn adhīta...</em>according to <em>shruti</em> scripture.</p>

[1-11-8,9]</p>

<p class="comment">
Heavenly abodes are dependent on begetting sons:<em> aputrasya gatir nāsti 
svargo naivaca naivaca</em> There is no way out [in other worlds] for those without sons...
<em>shruti</em> scripture. Hence the request of Dasharatha is that way.</p>

<p class="comment">
&#39;Sons and Paradise are intimately connected in Indian belief. A man desires above every thing 
to have a son to perpetuate his race, and to assist with sacrifices and funeral rites to make 
him worthy to obtain a lofty seat in heaven or to preserve that which he has already obtained.&#39;

<p class="comment">
While the chief priest Vashishta is officiator of all rituals no king can invite another priest 
to perform something without the consent of the officiating priest. Hence the consent of Vasishta 
is obtained, after asking Sumantra to reiterate what all was said, to sage Vashishta also.

Vishnu, into heavens, and thus those citizens felt that their human lord Dasharatha vies with 
divine lord Indra. [1-11-27b, 28]</p>

<p class="comment">
The simile of Indra to king Dasharatha is in two ways. Dasharatha ruled kingdom like Indra 
who rules Heavens. The word Indra <em>karmaṇa</em> also refers to the deeds of Dasharatha, 
in helping the gods&#39; forces combating the demonic forces. Thus the deeds performed by Dasharatha 
are like those of Indra&#39;s. Here Dasharatha is bringing Sage Rishyasringa to Ayodhya. Earlier 
Indra led Vamana, the dwarf-boy to heavens. Vamana is the incarnation of Vishnu in early ages 
and after Vamana suppressed Bali, the Emperor to netherworlds, Indra took Vamana to heavens. 
Thus Dasharatha is like Indra on earth, both by his virtue and deed. Incidentally, Vamana 
i.e., Vishnu, is the son-incarnate to Sage Kāshyapa, while sage Rishyasringa is the grandson 
of the same Kāshyapa. Thus Sage Kāshyapa is instrumental to these two incarnations. Through 
the divine grace of Sage Rishyasringa, the same Vishnu is going to take birth as Rama, while 
Sage Kashyapa is a grandparent of Rama in this era, and while he alone was Vishnu&#39;s father 
when Vishnu incarnated as Dwarf boy Vamana.</p>

The Riwik is not just a reciter of Veda-s but more a director or conductor of whole orchestration 
of the Vedic ritual, which involves lots of rules, in reciting hymns, in performing deeds 
and all in their exactness. The whole lots of works that need be performed have the order 
of precedence like prime, auxiliary or adjunctive in their ordinance. A Ritwik is the elated 
scholar who keeps track of these activities while other scholars recite hymns as directed 
by these Ritwik-s. Hence, Ritwik-hood is the highest.</p>
