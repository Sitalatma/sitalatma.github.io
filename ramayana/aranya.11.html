			<p class="txt">
			Rama comes across lake from which divine music is heard. Surprised at the musical notes 
			from beneath the waters of the lake he enquires with the sage who is following, and that 
			sage narrates the episode of Sage ṃandakarni. Then Rama proceeds on wondering at that lake, 
			and he visits all the hermitages about there and thus elapsed are ten years. Again Rama 
			returns to the hermitage of Sage Suteekhsna, and after staying there for some time, takes 
			leave of that sage and proceeds to see Sage Agastya. And on the way he visits the brother 
			of Sage Agastya also. Rama, on the way narrates about the great deeds done by Sage Agastya 
			in protecting humans from demons, and also depicts the propitious nature of Agastya&#39;s hermitage.</p>

This verse is commented specially by the ancient narrators. It is said that <em>Om, praṇava</em> is 
reflected in this verse. The Om is the compound of three letters <em>a + u + ma</em>, and the first 
letter in the verse is <em>a</em> , in <em>a +</em> grataḥ. The second letter of Om, i.e., <em>u</em> 
is <em>u</em> in <em>su sobhanā</em>. Other versions may read this as <em>su madhyamā</em> , even 
then this <em>u</em> is there. The letter before last word <em>ha</em> is <em>ma</em> , as in <em>jagā 
ma</em> . These three letters put together are Om. So the three, Rama, Lakshmana, Seetha are compared 
with these three letters of Om.</p>

Vishnu/Rama is in letter a and he is coursing ahead, <em>agrartaḥ prayayau</em> , followed by u, Lakshmi/Seetha, 
who is an embodiment of the Absolute&#39;s <em>karuṇa</em> , benevolence, as said at <em>lakshmyā kāruṇya 
rūpayā</em> And she is the illusory aspect of that Absolute, ṃaya, <em>yāmā ye m�</em> , and being 
so, she will be the veil in between that Absolute and Innate Soul. The last letter <em>ma</em> is
<em>makāro jīva vācaka, makāro dāsa vācaka</em>, is the sign for the servitude of the Innate Soul 
to the Absolute. That is what Lakshmana is.</p>

And <em>anu jagāma</em> means that which follows without any I-ness or ṃine-ness as a total surrender,
<em>kainkarya</em> . This <em>agrataḥ prayayau rāmaḥ</em> is said to be the leadership quality of Soul, 
or Rama, where he does it himself without preaching, like Krishna. Previously when they entered forests, 
Lakshmana was leading and showing the way, as a dutiful servant. During next phase all three walked 
in line. Now, Rama wanted to wage war with demons, thus he leads the way, keeping Seetha in centre, 
followed and guarded by Lakshmana. This is the view point of the sages following them, for they the 
sages always meditate about that Absolute, in terms of <em>Om</em>, and these three appeared as the 
three letters of Om.</p>

As per the above the counof monthst comes to sixty months, i.e., five years. But it is said that ten 
years are elapsed comfortably. There are a good number of arguments counting the months said above and 
the point of ten years, said finally. Dharmākūtam puts it as ten years only:
<em>tataḥ paryāyeṇa nikhila muni jana
nilayeṣhu nītvā dasha samvatsarān punarāgamya tīkṣhṇatapasaḥ sutīkṣhṇam||</em>  Thus ten full years are

Rama has seen hundreds of flowered forest trees that are battered by the trunks of elephants, that are 
adorned with monkeys, reverberated by hundreds of lusty bird folks, and that are enriched by the flowered 
climbers whorled around them. [4-11-75, 76]</p>

The name Agastya is derived from a famous act of this Sage. ṃt. ṃeru is the highest peak on earth. By 
its nature it grows day by day, and stands first to be saluted by the rising sun in east every day. 
Jealous of this ṃt. ṃeru, ṃt. Vindhya started to rise to exceed the height of ṃt. ṃeru, thus obstructing 
the sun&#39;s path. Then the day changed for night and the travel of Sun and ṃoon, the performance of Vedic 
rituals, which are bound by the solar lunar movement, went topsy-turvy. Then the gods prayed Agastya 
to do something to decrease the height of ṃt. ṃeru. Agastya and his wife then were coming to ṃt. Vindhya 
and seeing its height, he requested ṃt. Vindhya, &quot;Oh, ṃountain King Vindhya, myself and my wife are 
going southward, and we are not able to climb this much height... kindly lower yourself, so that we 
old people climb you and go to the other side...&quot; ṃt. Vindhya being an ardent worshipper of sages and 
saints immediately lowered his height to the ground level, so that the old couple need not climb but 
just walk over him. Agastya and his wife on coming to the southern side of the mountain again requested 
ṃt. Vindhya to be at this height only, for they will be returning soon to north. ṃt. Vindhya readily 
agreed for that also, and it is lying like that even today. Because Agastya did not return to north 
on coming to south ṃt. Vindhya is still believed to be at ground level. Thus the solar and lunar movement, 
seasons&#39; revolve, Vedic calendars etc. are again put to normalcy. Thus the name Agastya, <em>aga stha</em> 
mountain, stopper, <em>agam sthāsyati</em> or, <em>stabhnāti iti agastyaḥ</em>. He played an important 
role in uplifting southern regions of India, namely Dravidian cultures. Hid wife is Lopāmudra, the 
saintly lady will be quoted in Lalitha Sahasra Nāmāvali. The thousand name of ṃother Universe.</p>

This is an important point of Rama&#39;s speaking to Lakshmana for a protocol to enter the hermitage. Earlier 
all the three used to enter together, releasing bowstrings and in all their submissiveness. But here 
Rama wants to follow an imperial protocol to announce his arrival there. Rama is said to have asked 
Lakshmana to inform the sage that <em>karta</em> subject to eliminate - himself; and the object, or 
the instrument to eliminate Ravana, namely Seetha have come. Rama says in above verses that he would 
like to spend rest of the exile here in this hermitage. But Sage Agastya later asks him to proceed to 
Panchavati, i.e., towards the dominions of demons. For that and for keeping the sage informed about 
the arrival of time to eradicate Ravana, Rama seeks this protocol.</p>
