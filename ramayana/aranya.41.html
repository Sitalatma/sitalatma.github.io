<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 41<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">ṃāreecha dissuades Ravana again and warns him of the fatal consequences if Rama is irked by the wrongdoings of Ravana. In every
utterance, ṃāreecha repeats that not only Ravana but the entire demonic race is also going to ruin due to Ravana's impertinence. Finally when Ravana
is heedless of these advises, ṃāreecha prepares himself to die by the arrow of an enemy, namely Rama, rather than by his own clansman, Ravana.</p>
