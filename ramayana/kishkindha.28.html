The atmosphere bears pregnancy of rain water drawing through the sunrays, keeping that essence in air consolidating 
them to become watery clouds for a nine month period from the month of <em>kārtīka</em> to <em>āṣāDha</em>.

not at his side. Govindaraja.</p>

The duty of young scholars of Vedic studies is to wear black deerskin and sacred thread as their initiation into 
Vedic studies. In these rainy days, there will be no other activity to them than sitting tight to recite their 
texts. The caves of mountains are its own mouths and they are replete with air and air gives out a din, and even 
the Vedic recitation gives out a din of its own kind. Thus, the mountains appear to be like humble young-scholars 
of Veda-s, voicing out their chanting like the hum of the air in caves.</p>

This verse speaks about the one who is blessed by the Supreme Being by way of
His beneficence in the form of rain. For such a blessed soul <em>rajaḥ</em> which also means
<em>rajo guṇa</em>, 'over-activism...' apart from the meaning of 'dust..' is silenced. This is one
among the three attributes <em>sattva, rajaḥ, tamo guṇā</em>-s 'purity, activity, stolidity...'
and thus <em>rajaḥ prashāntam</em> 'the quality of over-activity is quietened, along with the
quality of stolidity...' thus, only 'purity' is evident in him in his worldly activities. <em>sa
himo vāyuḥ</em> 'with, coldness, is air...' the word 'air' denotes 'breathing humans' and those
blest human's heart breaths a cool breeze, rather than fumes and fires, that which is the attitude
of a person who is dominated by <em>rajo guna</em> 'attribute of over-activity...' Thus, they the
blessed souls have no evil effects of searing or scorching of summer. The compound <em>nigadha
doṣa... prashantāḥ</em> means worldly affairs, are silenced, where vile of summer is the
personified vile of worldly affairs. And even their worldly expeditions to conquer, to possess, and
to become significant etc., are stalled for the blessed souls <em>sthitāḥ... adhipānām</em>.
They have nothing to do here on earth because they are immigrants onto earth. So, they are
returning to their own country, quarters, or abode, <em>pravāsino... sva deshān</em>. Their own
place <em>sva desha</em> is <em>vaikunṭha</em>. Thus the divine rain blesses them with

The swans do not like muddy waters so they aspire the clear waters of Lake
ṃānasa in Himalayas. The great sages, averse to muddy worldly affairs, are also called 'swans,
supreme swans' <em>hamsa, parama hamsa</em> for they wander all over acquiring and disseminating
spirituality to world. But they take break in rainy season in a vow called <em>cātur māsyam</em>
and contemplate in their own <em>manas</em> 'mind' about the Supreme Being. If the swans tend to go
to Himalayan ṃānasa Lake, these sagely-swans tend to gain entry into their own mind in search of
Supreme. And, like swans that can search and separate milk from water to drink milk alone, the
sages can search for their being. The compound <em>sam prasthitā</em>, indicates a journey towards
Supreme. And <em>priya anvitā</em> indicates involvement in worldly affairs, nominally indicated
here as 'together with their lovers'. Contrarily, those ruddy gees bound by attachments do not flee
away, but they will stick to their worldly interests. Thus, this rainy season is sagely, to enable
the seekers to seek the Supreme, without any bickerings due from the world.</p>

The flowers and mineral ores are mingling in waters and flowing as one with the
waters. This is indicative of purposeful devotion, <em>sātvika guṇa prathāna bhakti</em>
