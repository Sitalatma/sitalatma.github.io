<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Hearing Guha's words about Rama, Bharata fell unconscious. Bharata eases himself thereafter and asks Guha to report further details
about Rama. Guha informs that eventhough he offered various kinds of flood to Rama, the latter refused it. He adds that Rama Seetha and Lakshmana
observed fasting for that night. Guha also informs Bharata that Lakshmana laid a bed of grass for Rama as well as Seetha to sleep theron and
Lakshmana stood guarding Rama during the night, along with Guha and his kinsmen.</p>
