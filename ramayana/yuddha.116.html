<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seetha gives a taunting reply to Rama, saying that why she was not abandoned by the latter, even at the time when Hanuma came to see
her in Lanka. Then, Seetha requests Lakshmana to prepare a pile of fire for her to enter. When Lakshmana prepares a pyre, Seetha prays the fire-god
and enters into it, in order toprove her conjugal fidelity.</p>
