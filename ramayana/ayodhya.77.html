After having passed the tenth day of the death of Dasaratha, Bharata having himself purified, performed Shraddha* rites on the arrival
of the twelfth day.</p>
<p class="comment">* Shraddha rites are in the honor and for the benefit of dead relatives observed with great strictness at various fixed periods
and on the occasion of rejoicing as well as mourning by the surviving relatives. These are performed by the daily offering of water and on the stated
occasion by the offering of Pindas or balls of rice and meal to three paternal forefathers i.e. Father, grandfather, and great grandfather. It is an
act of reverential homage to a deceased person performed by relatives, most desirably by a son of the deceased.</p>
