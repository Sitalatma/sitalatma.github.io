Almost every <em>purāṇa</em>, mythological treatise, deals with the sanctity of 
Ganga. It is therefore queried and counter-queried as to why and how she is sanctifying. 
ṃany treatises have detailed about it. This river emerges from the nail of the left 
foot&#39;s big-toe of Vishnu as said in Vishnu Purāna: <em>gangā deva anganā angānām 
anulepanā api pinjarā | vāma pāda ambuja anguṣhṭa nakha sroto vinirgatā | visṇor 
bhibharti yām bhaktyā sirasā ahar nisam dhṛivam - sivaḥ</em> Hence she took 
landing on Shiva&#39;s head. <em>sankarasya sirasi bhraṣhṭam patitam kalmaṣha apahā 
- mahesvara tīrtha</em> &#39;the one who plunged onto Shankara&#39;s head and the very 
same is the remover of sins.&#39;</p>

Even if that river has fallen onto the head of Shiva at a later time, her original 
birth place is at the feet of Vishnu hence that river is sacred. After falling on 
the head of Shiva she is released and she rapidly flowed onto earth. Hence, her 
speed and rapidity alone are the sanctifying factors. <em>nadī vegena sudhyati 
- govinda rāja</em> &#39;a river cleanses itself by its rapidity.&#39; As such, after incarceration 
by Shiva she flowed rapidly and thus her sanctity is kept up, by her very rapidity.</p>

On bearing these sanctifying waters on his head, Shiva became a sanctified Shiva 
as said at <em>sarit praparodakena tīrthena - candra- mauli vidhṛitena sivaḥ sivo 
ābhūt - bhāgavatapurāṇa</em>. Shiva presumed that he is honoured for the falling 
of Ganga on his head as said at <em>tat ambu patitam dṛiṣhṭvā dadhāra sirasā 
haraḥ | pāvanārtham jaṭā madhye - mahā bhārata</em> Even in <em>ādhyatma rāamayaṇa
</em>Sage Vashishta says to Vishnu <em>tvat pāda salilam dhṛitvā dhanvo bhūt 
girijā patiḥ - ādhyātma rāmāyaṇa</em> &#39;on bearing your foot&#39;s waters Shiva 
became pious.&#39;</p>

In the legend of <em>Trivikrama</em>, dwarf-ascetic-boy, at one place it is said 
that due to the pressure of the foot of Vamana, the incarnation of Vishnu, the shell 
of the universe is pierced and water available outside has gone in and that water 
belonged to the Divine Ganga. At another place it is said when Brahma washed the 
feet of Vishnu that water from his <em>kamanDulu</em>&#39;handy vessel&#39; flowed as Ganga. 
Still at another place it is said that the <em>dharma</em>itself flowed as Ganga 
at the behest of Brahma. These three are correlated and said that &#39;when Brahma washed 
the feet of Vishnu the waters were not sufficient enough to drench, then Brahma 
ordered <em>dharma</em>to flow like water, but that too was not enough, and when 
Vamana pierced the shell of universe then <em>dharma</em>flowed as Ganga.</p>

The <em>yoga</em> takes yet another viewpoint of Ganga. Their great <em>guru </em>is 
Shiva, and hence yogis say that every fraction of second Ganga, or <em>cetana</em>, 
vitality, flows in ones own body. <em>tat pāda padmajam ga~Ngām nipatantīm sva 
mūrdhani | cintayet brahma randhreṇa pravishantīm svakām tanūm | tayā sa~Nkṣhālayet 
deham bāhyam abhyantaram malam | tat kṣhaṇāt virajo mantra jāyate sphaṭika upamam 
||</em>According to the six-plexus theory <em>cetana shakti</em>, power of vitality, 
flows through <em>brahma randhra</em>&#39;the hole in the mid of the pate&#39; to <em>sahasrā 
kamala</em>the multi-petal-lotus, the Internal Capsule or the Reticular Activating 
System and from there to <em>ājñā cakra</em>&#39; plexus of discrimination&#39; back at 
the third eye, and from there the vitality flows down the lines of the three spinal 
nerves, viz., <em>iDā, pingala, suṣumna</em>sympathetic, parasympathetic and central 
spinal cord. These three are the three replicas of <em>Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati</em>. 
Their confluence occurs once at <em>ājñā cakra</em>&#39; third eye&#39; and again at the 
perineum and having gone to the perineum this Ganga activates the dormant particles 
of vitality to raise them up the spinal system. Thus, the Supreme Yogi Shiva ordains 
the vitality called Ganga to flow up and down the plexuses, from grey matter down 
to the perineum, only to activate the system. ṃore Information than this will become 
unjustifiable here.</p>

Ganga is ever holy because she does not have any womanly stigmas. <em>dvi māsam 
saritah sarvā bhavanti rajasvalāḥ - mārkanDeya - - simha karkāṭakayoḥ madhye 
sarvā nadyā rajasvalāḥ - vyāghrapāda</em> &#39;for two months all the rivers menstruate&#39; 
ṃākandeya Purāna. &#39;When sun in Leo-Cancer all rivers menstruate.&#39; that is due 
to monsoon and new waters, as such bathing in them at that time is prohibitive. 
But River Ganga perennially draws its river water from Himalayas thus she has no 
such blemish.</p>

For all these diverse opinions the reply is given in Ramayana itself as said in 
Ayodhya <em>vishṇu pāda udbhavām divyam - ayodhya</em>and also at 1-43-7 of Ramayana
<em>sā tasmin puṇyā - puṇye rudrasya mūrdhani - rāmāyaṇa</em>which imports 
the meaning: &#39;she that pious River Ganga, fell onto the pious head of Shiva,&#39; i.e., 
&#39;without any mutation, both Shiva and Ganga are the sanctifiers by themselves, while 
helping each other, i.e., Shiva helped Ganga to gain a foothold on His head, while 
Ganga helped Shiva to become the root cause to bear and release her brunt, and in 
turn, both of them helped the humankind.&#39; Thus, what more can be sanctity than helping 
the created beings with one&#39;s own <em>dharma</em>?</p>
