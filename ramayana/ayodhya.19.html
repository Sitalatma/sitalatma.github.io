<p class="txt">Rama on hearing the harsh and cruel words of Kaikeyi remains unruffled. He asks Kaikeyi sorrowfuly about the reason the king did not
speak to him directly about the matter. He then immediately decides to leave for forest after duly saluting the king and Kaikeyi. On the way to
forest He desires to visit his mother and Sita and inform them of his decision.</p>
