<p class="txt">
The dust raised by Rama's chariot having disappeared for a while, Dasaratha feels dejected and fell insensible on ground. When Kaikeyi
comes forward to support him he scolds and asks her not to touch him. Kausalya then lifts him up and persuades him to return to their house. His
personal attendants take him to Kausalya's apartments and seeing him plunged in grief, Kausalya seats herself beside him and began to lament in
various ways.</p>
