title=Preface

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is an ever-expanding ocean of transcendental nectar. <em>Saṅkīrtana-kathā</em> is the ripened fruit of the realizations gained by those who constantly swim in that ocean. Relishing this fruit inspires both speaker and hearer to dive still deeper into those ambrosial waters.

This book is a compilation of <em>saṅkīrtana-kathā</em>, specifically excerpts from lectures, letters, and assorted writings of His Holiness Harikeśa Swami, who is known for his aquatic dexterity within this nectar ocean. It is not meant to be a definitive work, but simply a dip into that nectar for which we are always anxious.

The prototype for this publication was a collection of unedited, roughly typed, and photocopied transcriptions entitled <em>Śri Viṣṇupāda Saṅkīrtana Nectar</em>. Compiled by Scandinavian devotees during the early eighties, it proved to be a constant source of inspiration and strength for book distributors and devotees in general for over a decade. Updated and refined over those ten years, the prototype has now evolved into the present book, <em>All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees</em>.

This publication is an attempt to spread the benedicting rays of the effulgent <em>saṅkīrtana</em> moon to every corner of this world. We hope to contribute to the raising of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> consciousness, which is a definite and practical step toward putting Śrīla Prabhupāda in the center of all activities, both individually and collectively. We want to encourage and support all of those who directly or indirectly engage in this glorious <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, and we want to increase the chances of those coming into contact with Śrīla Prabhupāda's emotional ecstasies through his wonderful books. Anyone who touches these books will be benefited.

Our editorial policy has not been to convert the inspired words of the exemplary <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee into formal prose but to retain the lively, emotive mood in which they were originally presented. We hope that the seriousness of the subject matter will be taken into consideration and that the reader will accept this honest attempt to glorify Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His illustrious <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

title=Introduction

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

Despite freezing cold, scorching heat, relentless rain, and maddening wind off the sides of frozen mountains, Śrīla Prabhupāda's <em>saṅkīrtana</em> warriors bring the mercy of his books to every door. Tolerating the constant changes in weather, drinking water, sleeping places, and food, they go from town to town, village to village, bringing a gift of love rarely seen in this world, and even more rarely attained. Tolerance is their regulative principle: tolerating the taunts and shouts of ignorant and trivial onlookers; tolerating being pushed, shoved, beaten, or spit upon; tolerating needless police interference; tolerating the pains in the back or feet; and above all, tolerating the mind. Such tolerance is found only in the greatest of yogis who have practiced their mystic art for so many years. The mercy of the Lord on His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> warriors is hard to describe, but He is inspiring me to do so. May He help me in this endeavor.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

Without concern for their bodily comforts or care for the whims of the constantly complaining mind and senses, they are promptly on the street early in the day and remain there, till all the materialistically minded people have gone home for the night. When they think of the so-called pleasure of the fruitive workers, their lips curl in disgust and they spit on it. But remembering their spiritual master's warning not to be too proud of their renunciation—for that can lead one to falldown—they regret this spontaneous external display of their higher taste and again fix their minds on the preaching mission. Who can maintain attachment to the material world after having tasted the nectar of the Lord's mercy? O devotees of the Lord, hear me well. If you wish to remain attached to home, family, nation, society, and the rest, do not go out preaching the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, for on the streets of the cities, towns, and villages, the flute sound of the Lord may be heard, even today, inviting His devoted followers to return to the shelter of His holy lotus feet.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

Some of these transcendental warriors have been distributing for years, without stop, day in and day out. They are fully dedicated to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service of their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Although such souls are rarely to be found in this world, the materialists cannot imagine that there are only a handful of them. "I see you people everywhere. How many of you are there anyway, thousands?" Due to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee's intensity of endeavor and boundless enthusiasm, the materialists cannot imagine that such an impact comes from a handful of dedicated men. This is the potency of one <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee; he can deliver a whole country by his spiritual determination to bring the books of Śrīla Prabhupāda to every door.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have the greatest association in the universe, for Kṣīrodakaśāyi Viṣṇu, the Paramātmā, the Supersoul within the heart of all living beings, is also a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. Caring for all living beings as the eternal spiritual guide within the Supersoul is always inducing the conditioned soul to walk in the path of the waiting distributor, hear what the devotee has to say, reach into his wallet, and take out the biggest note he has. All <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are glorious, for they know well that without their transcendental partner, the Supersoul, no one would take a book. Because of His constant transcendental association, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have forgotten the meaning of the word "loneliness," although they can see it on the faces of the people on the streets. And remember, only a devotee knows the real meaning of the word "love."

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

The concept of mercy can be understood only by examining the mercy the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees pour on the seemingly undeserving souls lost in an ocean of ignorance. Only by carefully studying this mercy can we know how Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda poured Their divine grace on the conditioned souls five hundred years ago. No need to wonder how it happened then, for it is happening again now. Only the most fortunate persons are born at this time, for they can accumulate piles of pious activities and acquire the seed of devotional service by purchasing a book of Śrīla Prabhupāda's. If they simply read it, the seed of <em>bhakti</em> will quickly sprout in their hearts. We look through the many letters of appreciation from the readers of our books, and we sit stunned, unable to fathom the unlimited mercy of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

The householders who remain at home with their economic problems, family encumbrances, and needs secretly lament that they cannot join these liberated <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and women who wander freely, without restriction, throughout the three worlds. Although the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are fully capable of enjoying their senses to the greatest degree, they are averse to doing so, for they only wish to please their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Family life, household affairs, children, problems, housing bills, <em>gurukula</em> costs, and all the other unfortunate "requirements" in a world covered by <em>māyā</em>'s unique power seem distant and unreal to those desiring to shower the rain of mercy on souls burning in the fire of material existence. They cannot discriminate between the cries of some living entities posing as their babies and those of the conditioned souls on the street who are lost and bewildered, without anyone to care for them. Considering themselves the real protectors of the living entities who stand before them, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees nurse these lost souls back to life with the milk of kindness and the all-powerful drug, the holy name of the Lord.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

Even if they win the weekly <em>saṅkīrtana</em> competition, they still know that the real victory is to conquer the senses and the mind. The sincere and enthusiastic cheers of the devotee audience, honestly ecstatic to hear the wonderful results of their worthy heroes, only add another burden to the sincere distributor's struggle, and therefore the experienced "winners" inwardly laugh, fully aware that this sophisticated snare of <em>māyā</em> is waiting to find some subtle weakness and ruin their <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spirit. Who in the three worlds can give up attachment to the fruits of their results? No one. But even the demigods learn a good lesson in renunciation by secretly observing the Sunday meetings of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men in the temple. They are amazed at the submissive attitude of these devoted souls, completely devoid of the concept of self glorification. Indeed, such great souls push off all attempts to glorify them as if they were avoiding disease personified. Who can understand their own minds besides themselves? We can only pray to associate with such selfless personalities life after life. A birth as a bug in the book bag of such great souls is superior to becoming Brahmā devoid of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spirit.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

They are gentle souls who are kind to all. Who can be more gentle than the devoted <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees who only think of the advancement of the fallen conditioned souls devoid of all understanding of spiritual life? Who can be kinder than they who profusely distribute the greatest gift in the universe?

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are like a wish-fulfilling tree, for they know the real desires of people: to be happy, peaceful, and eternally situated in their natural, constitutional positions as parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. Because the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are displaying their kindness throughout every town, we can understand something of the vast mercy of Lord Caitanya; otherwise, it would remain a mere theory. I offer again and again my humble obeisances unto the feet of such exalted Vaiṣṇavas as these, and pray that I may assist them in any way I can.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

Because of their devotion and dedicated endeavors, Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are all over the world. From Nome, Alaska, east to Tokyo, Japan, Śrīla Prabhupāda's books have been distributed in massive numbers and have found Their way into nearly every town and village. Where no books could conceivably go, these books go, for They are transcendental living entities, capable of intelligent and directed motion, wishing to bestow the greatest mercy on the conditioned souls throughout the world. These books are creating a revolution in the hearts of the people absorbed in a misguided civilization seemingly bent on self-destruction. It seems that there are people everywhere interested in the <em>Bhagavad-gitā</em>, <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>, and any literature from Śrīla Prabhupāda they can get their hands on. None but the rich, proud, and arrogant avoid the nectar of this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. And now the Soviets are importing our books and encouraging their translation. Need I say more than this?

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

Someone once said that some demigods have appeared as human beings to distribute these books in great quantities. Although this sounds nice, a real <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee does not believe it; for after all, he knows he was saved by his spiritual master. We were lost in a pit of ignorance and knew nothing of the higher realms of reality, when the spiritual master saved us from the eternal doom. We were fallen then, and outside of the mercy emanating from this transcendental literature, we would still be fallen now. A <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is intelligent and knows that he is personally nothing but the mercy of his spiritual master. And he is happy in this understanding. All <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are happy simply being instruments in this great mission. They know that the books distribute Themselves when we surrender to Them and Their mission. Actually we have been picked up from the lowest platform of existence and elevated to very high positions simply because we are associating with the supremely opulent Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and we are happy simply knowing Him as our master. As the servants of the king live on the same level as the king, so the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are glorified and living nicely as servants of the supreme controller. Is it possible to attain more opulence than this?

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

They drive their vans with great care and attention, filling up with petrol, regularly changing the oil, and checking the water, the anti-freeze, and the tires, for they consider their <em>saṅkīrtana</em> vehicle as reverential paraphernalia of the Lord. They take care of their vans as if these vehicles were members of Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental family, representatives of Garuḍa. Every <em>saṅkīrtana</em> warrior knows well that without these faithful carriers of the book Deities, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission would quickly grind to a halt. Never driving too fast, although always impatient to bring knowledge to every town, the saṅkīrtaners depart at the proper time to reach their destination without hurry. Even though Kṛṣṇa is protecting them, they never want to disturb Kṛṣṇa's transcendental pastimes by forcing Him to catch their van as it is rolling off a slippery road. They are models of safe and cautious driving, since they know that their cargo, the empowered <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and these transcendental books, is more valuable than piles of gold and jewels.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

They are so humble and meek that although they know well that they are engaged in the most important devotional service of all, the direct preaching mission of the Lord, they never demean the service of the other devotees who live in the temple and support the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Thus they are glorious in the eyes of all. They are devoid of the stain of false pride, for they know that without the support of the devotees in the temple <em>saṅkīrtana</em> could not go on. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are thankful to those dedicated souls taking the responsibility of washing the floors, worshiping the Deity, and cooking the noon offering. Every <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee knows perfectly well how hard it is to live in the temple, for without having to struggle in the preaching mission, control of the mind and senses is most difficult to achieve. Therefore, out of humility, like trees overloaded with the burden of ripe fruits, they bend low during their weekends in the temple, offering their respects to even a tiny ant. Having seen enough materialists during the week, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees know how rare it is for a devotee of the Lord to be fully engaged in devotional service in the temple.

sub=All Glories to the Saṅkīrtana Devotees!

They care about the people to whom they distribute. Not considering numbers more important, they really want people to read and understand these transcendental gifts. If they did not care about the fallen souls, how could the devotees go on, year after year, day in and day out, sustained by the satisfaction of the Lord! These <em>saṅkīrtana</em> warriors want to die on the battlefield. They wish to continue to distribute this literature in some form or another throughout their whole lives. They know nothing else than this intense and gratifying mission. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees know an open secret: if they can just continue distributing, they will get the mercy of their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and, in this very life, go straight back home, back to Godhead. Keeping this dearmost secret close to their hearts, they only wish that all other living entities would also take up devotional service and become auspicious and glorious too, for it is easy, sublime, and beyond the material world.

title=The Saṅkīrtana Tradition

sub=Worshiping Saṅkīrtana Devotees Is a Tradition

All service is based on the same point: In the heart you have to be attached to <em>Kṛṣṇa</em>. With some service you can fake it to a certain degree. You can go on for some time gardening, sweeping the floor, or typing correspondence without love of Godhead, but you cannot fake it when you are preaching. You must have some genuine attachment to <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> within your heart, because every day you are exposed to <em>māyā</em>. You may consider yourself glorious at doing a particular preaching service, but as soon as somebody criticizes you or a demon gives you trouble on the street, the glorious illusion is shattered and you reconsider, thinking, “Maybe I should become a cook.”

The fact that one continues <em>saṅkīrtana</em> proves that one has attained love of Godhead. Therefore we worship the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. Sometimes a foolish polemic arises if someone dares to say that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are the greatest, because others think, “What's the matter with you? Don't you understand that everything else is just as important?" Yes, it is true—the point is love of God—but a preacher must have love of God; otherwise, he sinks back into just taking care of himself. Therefore we worship the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

In Bengal, if you do a <em>harināma</em> on the street, all the people come out with <em>lotās</em> of water and try to throw it at your feet. They know you will probably jump away, so they are satisfied if it just lands on the ground in front of you. Then they bring out a plate of colored rice and cracked coconut, and they start offering you <em>ārati</em>. Everybody—every householder, every villager—comes out to worship the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. This is tradition.

It is a tradition in Lord Caitanya's movement to worship <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. It is not a concoction of fanatics. It is a <em>sampradāya</em> tradition coming to us through the <em>paramparā</em>, and it cannot be whimsically given up. It must be continued, because love of God comes in this age through <em>saṅkīrtana</em>—glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> we do nowadays is absolutely <em>paramparā</em>. Although book distribution is criticized by some persons of little knowledge, it is Lord Caitanya's mission without even the slightest deviation. It is the authorized means of attaining love of God. <em>Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair/yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</em>—if you have brains, you will join in the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> and become a lover of God. You will understand and appreciate the association of anyone fully absorbed in this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement.

sub=The Birth of the Saṅkīrtana Movement

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement appeared when Lord Caitanya began to preach in Navadvīpa. At that time, there was only the chanting of the holy name of the Lord. Book distribution developed later on, when Lord Caitanya encouraged the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana to write books. Some people ask, "Why didn't Lord Caitanya Himself start the book distribution?” The answer is simple: There were no books. First He had to make the devotees who would write the books. Then He could inspire others to produce and distribute them.

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's foremost representatives, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, received direct instruction from Lord Caitanya to reveal the principles of devotional service in written form for the benefit of all Vaiṣṇavas. When the Gosvāmīs first went to Vṛndāvana, it was a jungle. The many places of pilgrimage we can visit nowadays had not yet been excavated and restored. Lord Caitanya instructed Rūpa and Sanātana Gosvāmīs to rediscover these places, but their main business was to write books. Sitting under the trees, they would dip a quill pen into some ink made from pressed flowers and write on special leaves (there was no paper at that time). On one leaf after another they wrote the wonderful books that form the foundation of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement-books such as the <em>Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</em> and <em>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</em>, which give all the necessary instructions for devotional service.

The intention of the Gosvāmīs was never sectarian. They wanted all the people of the world, regardless of their languages, to get the essence of Vedic knowledge. Prior to this, Vaiṣṇava philosophy—so perfectly extracted from the <em>Vedas</em> and <em>Purāņas</em>—had not been systematically written down. But for the benefit of the followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, book production was begun by Śrīla Sanātana and Rūpa Gosvāmīs and later continued by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, who was the most prolific author among the Gosvāmīs. The writings of the Gosvāmīs turned out to be the most important form of saṅkīrtana, because they were writing books that were soon to be distributed.

After the disappearance of Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī and Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī became the Vaiṣṇava <em>ācārya</em> in Vṛndāvana. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī was convinced by Śrīmati Jāhnavā-devī, the wife of Lord Nityānanda and head of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, of the need to send <em>bhakti</em> literature from Vṛndāvana to Bengal. Some years earlier, she had visited Rūpa and Sanātana in Vṛndāvana and was well aware of the abundant spiritual literature the Gosvāmīs were producing. To comply with her wishes, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī sent Śrīnivāsa Ācārya and Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura to distribute the books that had been written to the intellectuals of Bengal. From the precedent set by the Gosvāmīs, book production has been the basis of spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement right up to the present time.

sub=Bolo Kṛṣṇa Bhaja Kṛṣṇa<br />Koro Kṛṣṇa-śikṣā

When Śrīla Prabhupāda began preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West, he used the example of Jagāi and Mādhāi to demonstrate the incredible mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, because wherever he looked he saw Jagāis and Mādhāis. By using this example, he clearly implied, “Don't worry, by Lord Caitanya's mercy even you can be saved.”

Jagāi and Mādhāi were members of a wealthy and learned aristocratic family that had been respected in Navadvīpa for many generations, but these two men were extraordinary, for they were the greatest debauchees, murderers, drunkards, and thieves. After stealing someone's belongings, they would burn down his house. They would rape women and even kill people. They were very big, very crazy, and could not be stopped. Even the law was afraid of them. They were total outcasts—black sheep in society—and their family had rejected them long ago. They constantly wandered the streets of Navadvīpa in a drunken state, making big scenes. Whenever one of them was not paying attention, the other one would beat him with his fists. One moment they would embrace each other in brotherly love, and the next moment they would pull each other by the hair and fall to the ground, fighting. They were completely mad—more or less the way we were before joining Śrīla Prabhupāda's movement.

One day Lord Caitanya told Nityānanda Prabhu and Haridāsa Ṭhākura, “I have a new program for you. I want you to go out and preach. Just tell everybody, '<em>Bolo kṛṣṇa, bhaja kṛṣṇa, koro kṛṣṇa-śikṣā</em>—chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, worship Lord Kṛṣṇa, and live according to His transcendental instructions.”

Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura would go out every day, knock on every door, and say, “Chant Kṛṣṇa's name, worship Him, and accept His instructions into your life.” Śrīla Prabhupāda often cited Locana dāsa Ṭhākura, who described how Lord Nityānanda cut a canal from the ocean of mercy, which was blocked on all four sides. Taking that canal to the door of every house, He would flood everybody in the house with love of Godhead.

Seeing the effulgence coming from the bodies of these two wonderful personalities, the pious people would say, "Yes, I will do it from today on. Welcome, please come in and take something to eat.” But Nityānanda and Haridāsa would reply, "No, we have no time. We are busy preaching, and we have to go to the next door.”

At some houses, however, the impious people would shout at them, saying, "What are you doing here? You are simply frauds and imposters. If you come back again, I'm going to call the law!" Other rascals would say, “You only come here to get something to fill your bellies.”

"This Nimāi Paṇḍita has ruined many good persons, and now He is ruining you as well.”

"Can't you understand that you should only chant 'Kṛṣṇa' softly? Don't you think your God is going to be disturbed by all your screaming and howling?"

When Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura came back every night and told Lord Caitanya about the rascals they had met, Lord Caitanya would say, “Do not fear, I will cut off their heads with My <em>cakra</em>. Anybody who does not accept what you say, I will cut to pieces."

But Nityānanda Prabhu would pacify Him, saying, “Please wait. We want to continue, and we haven't met everybody yet.”

Once Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura were out preaching, and they saw a big crowd of people. Lord Nityānanda asked what was going on, and some of the bystanders replied, “Oh, it is those hooligans Jagāi and Mādhāi.”

“Who are they?"

"They are terrible persons, Gosāin. This is no place for You. For Your own safety, You should leave this place immediately.”

But Lord Nityānanda's interest was aroused. “Tell Me more,” He said. "Who are these two, Jagāi and Mādhāi?” After the people explained the whole story, Lord Nityānanda continued, “Oh, I want to go and save them. If these persons are saved, then everybody will worship My Lord, Gaurāṅga. Everybody will understand that His mercy is supreme in this world, and they will all sing His praises. What a wonderful opportunity!”

In response, the well-meaning people cried out a warning: "Don't go near these fellows! They will harm You or even kill You! They are crazy, don't You understand? Take our words seriously!”

Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura ignored them and went near the two brothers. Approaching from the side, out of the brothers' vision, Lord Nityānanda called out, “Listen, dear brothers! Chant Kṛṣṇa's name, worship Him, and take His instructions into your life. If you just chant His holy name, you will be happy.”

In one respect the sinful brothers were all right. They were not <em>aparādhīs</em>. They didn't understand how to offend Vaiṣṇavas, because they were always too drunk. But now two Vaiṣṇavas were standing in front of them. When the brothers heard the request that they surrender to Kṛṣṇa and chant His name, their eyes turned blood-red with rage, and they started chasing Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who went racing off in full flight. The two monstrous brothers drunkenly stumbled along after them, screaming, “Wait! We'll show you what we think of your chanting! Why don't you stay here and get to know us better?”

Then Haridāsa Ṭhākura said to Lord Nityānanda, “Another fine mess You've gotten us into. We came here to preach, and look what's happened now! It's all because of Your magnanimous nature.”

Lord Nityānanda replied, “It's not My fault! It's your Lord Caitanya's fault. He's the one who sent us here."

Arguing as they were running, Haridāsa Ṭhākura complained, “I don't know why I keep coming out with You! You're always getting us into trouble. You jump into the Ganges and start wrestling with the crocodiles. You chase after children playing on the riverbank, screaming frighteningly, and I have to console the angry parents who want to beat You, trying to explain to them that You're an <em>avadhūta</em> and You think You're a cowherd boy. You ask girls to marry You. You milk cows and drink all the milk. You steal buckets of butter and cream, and when the bewildered cowherd men come to beat You, You run away, leaving me alone to ward them off. I don't know why I come with You all the time. This preaching gets us into so much difficulty!”

In this way they ran down the road toward Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita's house enjoying a mock argument. Finally, Jagāi and Mādhāi became so confused that they just fell down on the street, and Lord Nityānanda and Haridāsa Ṭhākura slipped out of sight to recover. Breathing heavily and looking back in the direction of their fallen pursuers, Nityānanda and Haridāsa began to laugh, joking about the two drunkards and embracing each other in ecstasy.

Upon hearing about everything that had happened, Lord Caitanya angrily exclaimed, “I will chop them to pieces immediately!”

But Nityānanda Prabhu implored, “No, give us a chance to save them. If You will kindly offer Your mercy to them, they will surely be saved.”

At this Lord Caitanya said, “If You want them to be saved, then they are immediately saved. It has already happened by Your desire. Soon we shall see them in our company as Vaiṣṇavas.” When the associates of the Lord heard this decree, they all started to jubilantly chant “Hari bol!"

Soon, by divine arrangement (Lord Caitanya's desire), Jagāi and Mādhāi set up their den on the Ganges where Lord Caitanya took His bath. The rogues were so nasty—rolling around drunkenly and doing all kinds of horrible things—that nobody wanted to bathe in the Ganges anymore. Lord Caitanya would keep His distance, but when Jagāi and Mādhāi saw Him, they would mockingly request Him to conduct a Durgā-ārati, because they liked to dance drunkenly to the sound of the sweet <em>kīrtana</em> coming every night from the Lord's house.

Shortly thereafter, Lord Nityānanda thought, "Now is My chance.” He stood before Jagāi and Mādhāi peacefully and said, “My Lord Caitanya wishes that you be blessed with love of Godhead. Please kindly accept the lotus feet of the Lord and render devotional service unto Him.”

"Who is this?” Mādhāi asked, “What does this guy want?” In reply Jagāi sneeringly drawled, “He's an <em>avadhūta</em>.” When Mādhāi heard this, he picked up a piece of a broken earthen wine pot and threw it at Nityānanda Prabhu. It hit Him in the forehead and blood came pouring down all over His body. Mādhāi raised his arms and moved forward, wanting to attack again, but Jagāi grabbed him and protested, “What are you doing? Are you mad? He's innocent! He didn't do anything wrong. Why are you threatening Him like this? You should protect Him.” The townspeople witnessing the incident quickly ran to Lord Caitanya and told Him what had happened. When Lord Caitanya came and saw blood all over Nityānanda Prabhu, He raised His index finger in the air and cried out threateningly, “<em>Cakra!</em>" Summoned thus, the Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> immediately appeared, spinning on His finger. The brothers were struck with amazement and fear, for they knew that this <em>cakra</em> was ready to chop them in half.

Nityānanda Prabhu appealed to the Lord. “Stop!” He cried, “You have appeared in this incarnation to save them, not to kill them! Your mission is not to kill the demons but to flood them with love of Godhead. Jagāi was trying to protect Me. It's all over now; it was just an accident, and I don't feel any pain. There is nothing to worry about and I am not disturbed."

When Lord Caitanya heard this He immediately embraced Jagāi, saying, "Oh, My dear Jagāi, you are so wonderful for protecting My Lord Nityānanda.” Jagāi immediately fell over unconscious in love of Godhead, shaking and rolling on the ground. Since Jagāi and Mādhāi were practically like one soul, Mādhāi also became purified. Realizing what a fool he was, he threw himself at the feet of Lord Caitanya, saying, “Please purify me too! Why only him?”.

Lord Caitanya replied, “I cannot deliver you. You were responsible for shedding Nityānanda's blood.”

But Mādhāi begged, “You cannot say this, my Lord. How can You act against Your own religion? In Your previous incarnation You even gave liberation to demons who pierced Your body with arrows. And they were big demons, whereas I'm only a little demon! Why shouldn't You accept me?"

Lord Caitanya was firm. “That may be good logic,” He said, "but you have offended Nityānanda Prabhu. Go and surrender to Him!” Mādhāi immediately clasped the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, and then he too became mad in love of Godhead.

Afterward they all went back to Lord Caitanya's house. When the other devotees saw how Jagāi and Mādhāi had become the personal associates of the Lord and were rolling on the ground in love of Godhead, they could not believe it. They asked, “How did these drunks become devotees?"

Lord Caitanya answered, “Don't call them drunks! They are Vaiṣṇavas! Accept them as your brothers.” Everybody was amazed.

In an equally amazing way, Śrīla Prabhupāda transformed sinful wretches like us into blissful devotees of Lord Caitanya and engaged us in the Lord's eternal <em>saṅkīrtana-lilā</em>.

sub=Bṛhad-mṛdanga

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement took birth with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, but its rebirth took place when books became an important and powerful means to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness to everyone. After Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu left this world, Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism diminished. The Vaiṣṇavas either went back to Godhead or went on different preaching engagements throughout the universe. Only a few were left. The world filled up with dull souls engaging in fruitive activities.

Over a century ago, Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, the leader of the Vaiṣṇavas in Mayapur, declared to Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura that he should spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in an organized fashion. On that order, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura personally reconstructed the basis of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism. He reestablished the places of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's appearance and pastimes in Mayapur and wrote hundreds of books and articles. But this reconstruction was a hard task, so he begged the Lord to send “a ray of Viṣṇu” to help him. Kṛṣṇa was merciful and sent an assistant, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda, whose preaching was so powerful that all over India, Māyāvādi philosophy and caste gosvāmism were smashed.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī started a society of Vaiṣṇavas known as the Gauḍīya Maṭha. He had thousands of disciples, and some of his representatives went as far as England and Germany. His mission was a great one. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta established the method needed to cut the hard knot of material attachment in the heart, <em>hṛdaya-granthi</em>. The way to cut this <em>hṛdaya-granthi</em> is with <em>grantha</em>—the books of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or <em>śāstra</em>. <em>Sāstra</em> means not only "book” but also "weapon.” This relationship is significant, because the books are our weapons.

Prior to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta's time, books were distributed to scholars, but not in a systematic way to people in general. Lord Caitanya recommended chanting and <em>prasādam</em> for the masses and philosophy for the scholars. But as Kali-yuga progressed, people became so fallen that they were unable to accept the chanting and <em>prasādam</em>, and they required understanding to go forward.

Therefore Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta put so much emphasis on publishing books. He called book publication the <em>bṛhad</em>, or big, <em>mṛdanga</em>. The little <em>mṛdanga</em> may be heard for one block, but the big <em>mṛdanga</em> can be heard around the world. In the marble temple Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta had built in Bagh Bazaar, Calcutta, he installed the Deity on one side and the printing press directly opposite, across the courtyard. To him the printing of books was so important that he considered the beat of the press to be <em>kīrtana</em> and wanted it to sound in the temple all day. Listening to that <em>kīrtana</em> and having <em>darśana</em> of the printing press, the Deities were very happy.

sub=Lava-mātra

The <em>śāstra</em> declares that one should associate with a saintly personality, even if just for a moment, a <em>lava-mātra</em>. (A <em>lava</em> is one eleventh of a second.) This association can change one's entire life. Śrīla Prabhupāda used his own life as evidence of this statement. Śrīla Prabhupāda was not interested in hearing from some ordinary <em>sādhu</em> when he first went to see Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, because Śrīla Prabhupāda had experienced the different <em>sādhus</em> who came to his father's house. They were engaged in illicit activities like smoking <em>gañjā</em> or eating meat, and he was not enthusiastic to meet another one. But his friend practically brought him by force.

At first Śrīla Prabhupāda started to argue with Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta a little, saying, “How can India take interest in spiritual practices if it is a nation subordinate to the British? First we must gain our freedom, and then we can have Kṛṣṇa consciousness.” But Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta did not accept this argument. He said that winning independence from the British was a material affair; it had nothing to do with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Rather, one should depend on Kṛṣṇa and serve Kṛṣṇa, and then all material problems of life will cease, including the problem of dependency on a foreign power.

Śrīla Prabhupāda realized that this <em>sādhu</em> was right and that Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission was safely in the hands of an expert. Although it was not a long meeting, Śrīla Prabhupāda was completely convinced and took the mission to heart.

sub=If You Ever Get Money

When Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura organized a large <em>parikrama</em> of the Vṛndāvana area, Śrīla Prabhupāda met him at Rādhā-kunda. While they were walking and talking together, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta stated to Śrīla Prabhupāda confidentially, “I regret that I have built this temple in Bagh Bazaar, because there will be fire within these walls. Already in my presence they are fighting over who will get which room in the temple, and after my departure everything will be ruined. I would rather take down the marble from the walls and floors, sell it, and print books. If you ever get any money, print books."

Distributing books in India at that time was difficult. If a disciple went over to Navadvīpa and distributed even one magazine, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta would heap praise upon him. It became obvious to Śrīla Prabhupāda that books were more important to his spiritual master than temples, and he became fixed on what was important, although he was living outside the Gauḍīya Maṭha. From the outside he could observe what his spiritual master was constantly stressing. The others living inside were thinking about the politics and sense gratification concerning their residence and surroundings. There were many problems. That is why Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta called it “fire within the walls.” But Śrīla Prabhupāda, watching his spiritual master act, could see that printing books was the real point. Later, when Śrīla Prabhupāda was expanding his Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, again and again he always repeated, “Print books! Print books! Print books!” because that is what he had learned from his spiritual master. That is called <em>paramparā</em>—learn the most important activity from your spiritual master and make it your life's mission.

sub=Taking Up the Mission

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī made the mission of his father, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, his mission and spread that mission throughout India. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda took up that mission and spread it all over the world. The mission was tenderly passed down from one <em>ācārya</em> to the next. Others may claim that they too were responsible for wonderful things in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but we don't see it. We see how one pure devotee can create another, how one <em>nitya-siddha</em> awakens another, and how the mission is given from <em>guru</em> to disciple.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta told Śrīla Prabhupāda on their first meeting, “You are intelligent. Preach this mission in the English language for the benefit of the world.” Śrīla Prabhupāda had not even been to the temple yet, but the instruction that eventually led to Śrīla Prabhupāda's coming to the Western world was already given. He just walked in, bowed down, listened a little while, made some argument, and got the mission of his life. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta cut out the formalities and got to the point, because he knew he was talking to a <em>nitya-siddha</em>.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta was pleased with Śrīla Prabhupāda. When Śrīla Prabhupāda did the preaching that established the Bombay temple in 1935, the devotees said, “He is expert. He should be the temple president.” But Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta replied, “Do not push him for this now. In the future he will do everything." Nobody understood the meaning of this statement. Some thought Śrīla Prabhupāda was too attached and could not do it, but they did not know that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta knew Kṛṣṇa's plan. He used the word "everything." What did that mean? It meant exactly that Śrīla Prabhupāda would do everything needed to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls all over the world.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was so powerful that after his disappearance, nobody was there to replace him. So many problems arose, because his disciples were not working together for the preaching mission. Śrīla Prabhupāda once wrote in one of his Vyāsa-pūjā offerings, “The world looks empty in the absence of you.” The world looked vacant, for his spiritual master was the only one who could tie together the disjointed forces.

Śrīla Prabhupāda tried to bring these forces together, but he could not, so in due course of time he took up that mission by writing and publishing books. Śrīla Prabhupāda was producing books twenty years before he came to America. In the 1940's he started “Back to Godhead," an English magazine that presented the philosophy in an understandable way. He started to translate the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, which he printed serially in his magazine. He wrote more than one thousand pages of commentary on the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, which were unfortunately lost somehow. His grand opus was <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>. When he finished the first three volumes of the First Canto, in which he included everything necessary to make one Kṛṣṇa conscious, the time was ripe to fulfill the mission of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and go to the Western countries.

Śrīla Prabhupāda was having dreams in which his spiritual master would come to him and say, “Come with me! Take <em>sannyāsa</em>!” Śrīla Prabhupāda would wake up from the dream and think, “Take <em>sannyāsa</em>! Oh, how terrible!” But after a while he realized that this might be the only means to preach. One of his Godbrothers, Śrīla Keśava Mahārāja, told Śrīla Prabhupāda that unless one becomes a <em>sannyāsī</em>, it is not possible to preach everywhere. Therefore Śrīla Prabhupāda entered the renounced order of life, started producing the <em>Bhāgavatam</em>, and prepared to go West.

sub=Law Books For the Next<br />Ten Thousand Years

Regardless of where you are in the line of followers of Śrīla Prabhupāda, it is your responsibility to print and distribute his books in mass quantities throughout the world. This was his desire, the desire of his spiritual master, and the desire of all the <em>ācāryas</em>, and therefore it is also our desire. Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are not just for one generation. He said that he was writing these books as the law books for the next ten thousand years. That doesn't mean you put them on the shelf in some lawyer's office; it means you give them to everybody.

Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote these books to be read by all people, in all places, and at all times. They are eternally relevant because they contain all the instructions necessary for spiritual life from the <em>mahātmās</em>, and thus they will be the basis of the future Kṛṣṇa conscious civilization. <em>Mahat-sevām dvāram āhur vimukteḥ</em>—if you associate with a <em>mahātmā</em> and read these books, the door to liberation is thrown open to you.

sub=Symptoms of a Sādhu

During the Kārttika festival of 1972, Śrīla Prabhupāda lectured daily at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple from <em>The Nectar of Devotion</em>. He sat under the same tree the Gosvāmīs used to sit under and discuss topics about Kṛṣṇa and how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that once he was sitting in front of Rūpa Gosvāmī's <em>samādhi</em> and Rūpa Gosvāmī personally told him to go and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries.

At that time, Śrīla Prabhupāda was already into the retirement years. Nowadays, they retire people at the age of sixty or sixty-five and give them retirement benefits, because they can no longer work efficiently and earn their pay. But Śrīla Prabhupāda was writing <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> and performing <em>bhajana</em>-hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord under the direct inspiration and instruction of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. And now in his old age, he was going to America.

By going West, Śrīla Prabhupāda displayed the symptoms of a saintly personality, a <em>sādhu</em>. A real <em>sādhu</em> is <em>titikșavaḥ kāruņikāḥ suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>. <em>Titikṣavaḥ</em>—tolerant; <em>kāruņikāḥ</em>—merciful; <em>suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>—the best well-wishing friend of all living entities.

Śrīla Prabhupāda was so tolerant. While following the order of his spiritual master and going to America, he tolerated much suffering and difficulty. First, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean by boat. I know what it means to be on a boat. Once I took a ferry from Sweden to Poland. It took twenty-seven hours. I spent the ferry ride as sick as ten dogs. After that, I swore that I would never take a boat again as long as I live, and I haven't. If you just mention a boat, I get seasick. Śrīla Prabhupāda, on the other hand, was on a cargo carrier for thirty-eight days. While at sea, he tolerated severe seasickness and several heart attacks. But he was assured of Kṛṣṇa's protection. Kṛṣṇa and all of His incarnations appeared to him in a dream. They were in another boat, pulling him through the water and encouraging him onward with the words, “Yes, you must go to America.”

After arriving in America, he first stayed with a family who didn't know anything about Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then at a YMCA. Then, without friends, money, or facilities, he went to the most degraded place in New York City—the Bowery. In this hellish place, as well as in the equally hellish Lower East Side, there were many obstacles, but he went on with his preaching. He worked hard, even cooking for the devotees and distributing <em>prasādam</em> to them, because he was <em>kāruņikaḥ</em>—merciful.

We are all made of Śrīla Prabhupāda's mercy. Without his great tolerance and mercy, we would never have received this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Who in the history of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism or before that ever even thought of going to the Western world and preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura had introduced Kṛṣṇa consciousness by sending books to the West, but nobody had ever gone there to preach to the <em>mlecchas</em> and <em>yavanas</em>, live among them, and make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. We can never glorify Śrīla Prabhupāda enough, because if he had not come, none of us would be here today. We would still be rotting in the material world, performing obnoxious activities. We all know perfectly well what we would be doing if it had not been for Śrīla Prabhupāda. We owe our lives to him. Therefore we should completely surrender our entire lives at the lotus feet of the Founder-Ācārya of this society, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This will make us qualified to satisfy the previous <em>ācāryas</em> and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nothing more is to be gained in the world than this.

Śrīla Prabhupāda's mood was simple to understand. He was in the mood of Prahlāda Mahārāja. Once in South Africa, while Śrīla Prabhupāda was writing the section of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> that tells of Prahlāda Mahārāja, I happened to mention, "Śrīla Prabhupāda, you are always absorbed in the mood of Prahlāda Mahārāja,” and he said, “Yes, I am always thinking of how to save these fools and rascals.” We can read about Prahlāda Mahārāja and try to enter into his mood. Then we will understand the mood of the preacher, whose only concern is to give Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the people of this world.

The disciple should want to share the mood of his spiritual master to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world. That is why we travel from town to town and village to village with Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, expanding Śrīla Prabhupāda's preaching mission and bringing new people to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. By doing this the disciple can become perfect. This is the real meaning of mercy—to only think of the best thing for people's Kṛṣṇa consciousness and to try to help them advance in spiritual life.

To spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness Śrīla Prabhupāda continually traveled worldwide, writing and preaching wherever he went. It was a great austerity, but because he felt love and compassion for all living entities, <em>suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>, preaching was his life. He was preaching early every morning by writing his transcendental purports, he was preaching during the morning walk, and he continued preaching by giving morning class. All day and night, in every activity and at every opportunity, Prabhupāda was preaching. He was always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's philosophy, Kṛṣṇa's words, and preaching Kṛṣṇa's glories. Everything he saw would remind him of a philosophical point, with which he would expand our consciousness and understanding of Kṛṣṇa. It was wonderful to have his association and hear his explanations.

Śrīla Prabhupāda was not only learned, but he also gave us everything in his books. He translated the texts from the original Sanskrit and manifested his emotional ecstasies in incomparable purports. When people open their minds and begin to read Śrīla Prabhupāda's words, his great love and mercy enter and gradually change their hearts.

Śrīla Prabhupāda is so pleased that we are printing his books in all different languages. We just print books and fill up the warehouses, never worrying about printing too many books. We often have a competition between the BBT devotees and the distributors: the BBT devotees are only happy when the warehouse is full of books, and the distributors are only happy when the warehouse is completely empty. We have so much work ahead of us. We have so many books to be distributed

Śrīla Prabhupāda was the first book distributor. He went to America with almost nothing except two wooden cases of his transcendental books. By selling them, he managed to survive. Later, when the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books were printed, he was the first one to distribute them. During the 1970 Ratha-yātrā in San Francisco, Śrīla Prabhupāda was on the stage, and someone brought the first ten copies up to him. Prabhupāda announced: “Now an important moment in history has come. For the first time these beautifully bound <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books are available in the English language. Who will come up and take these books? Ten dollars each. And I will sign them!” Hundreds of people ran up to the stage with ten dollar bills in their hands. The books were sold in an instant, and he didn't even keep a copy for himself. This is <em>suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām</em>.

Nowadays, when we want to start a new project, we need a pile of money in the bank and so much paraphernalia before we can do anything. What now takes many of us to do, Śrīla Prabhupāda did by himself. He is the personification of Kṛṣṇa's mercy, and he descended into this world just to perform this most ecstatic mission. Therefore we want to develop attachment to his lotus feet and go on with his mission.

sub=The Tradition Continues

The mission that Śrīla Prabhupāda has given us originally came from Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya says in the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, <em>Adi-lilā</em>, Chapter Nine, “I order every person within this universe to take up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and spread it everywhere.” If you do that - and it is not difficult to do—then Lord Caitanya is ready to throw mercy all over you.

I can remember a graphic illustration of this mercy, as it descends through Śrīla Prabhupāda. We were smuggling books into the former East Germany, an activity for which one could go to jail for at least fifteen years. We went through the border in two vans. I went through with entry status and the other van went through with transit status. We both had the same model of van, old Hanumag Henschels, which we used at Schloss Rettershof for book distribution. The transit van was filled with boxes of books, and I was alone in the completely empty entry van. The border guard got suspicious when he looked into my van because there wasn't a single thing in it except the car papers. I didn't even have a suitcase, because there would not be enough room for anything else in the van when we filled it with books.

According to our plan, we would meet at the first rest area that was open. The other van arrived before me because going through transit was quicker than going through entry. We met and parked the two vans right next to each other. We were just going to take the books out when a police car came into the rest area. Trying to look calm and innocent, we took some apples and sat under a tree. The police were looking at us and the vans again and again. They could plainly see that one van was empty and the other piled up with boxes, but they must have thought that it looked innocent, because they went on their way.

When they left, we immediately piled all the books into my van, and I drove off. After about five kilometers, I saw the police car by the side of the road and one of the policemen, standing by the car with a walkie-talkie. When he saw me, he started waving his hands for me to stop. I thought, “Now I am finished. I have entry status and not transit, and the van is filled with illegal books. This means the end." I figured that it would be better to outrace these people than it would be to go to jail for fifteen years. After all, it looked as though I would go to jail anyway. Pretending not to see the policeman, I looked straight ahead and just kept on driving. As soon as I went over the first hill, I pushed the gas pedal to the floor and went full speed ahead, 130 kilometers per hour, down the East German autobahn, waiting for the flashing light of the police car to appear in my rear-view mirror.

Then, all of a sudden, Kṛṣṇa, out of His extraordinary mercy, started pouring down a thunderstorm bigger than had ever been seen in the history of mankind, and it had been so hot that day that the rain immediately caused steam to rise from the autobahn. Steam was everywhere, thunder was booming, lightning was flashing, and I was surfing down the road as fast as I could go. I pulled off at the first exit, which was illegal with my entry status (I was supposed to use only the exit designated for my destination), and I screamed down the road toward Leipzig to deliver the books. By Kṛṣṇa's arrangement, the police car must have been caught in the midst of the storm, and no one was following me.

I arrived in Leipzig at about nine-thirty at night. It was dark. I ran up to the house of the devotee who was to receive the books. I banged on his window, and he came out all groggy. I said, “I have some books. Are you ready for them?” He said, "OK,” and I ran back to unload the van. Although the books were so heavy that two men had had to load each box into the van, I was so full of adrenaline that I picked up a box all by myself, ran up to the house, and threw it through the window. It hit this devotee in the chest, and he fell, moaning, to the floor. I kept running back and forth as fast as I could with boxes of books from the van, which was under a street light because there was nowhere else to park. I kept throwing the boxes through the window, and he kept falling to the floor. Finally his little room was so full of books that he had no more place to stay, and I said, “Good-bye. See you tomorrow, if I can.”

I ran to the van and drove off, thinking, "I have done it. I'm safe. There is no problem.” Then, after driving around until two in the morning to get to a campground, I went to sleep. I was sleeping dead away, when around five-thirty in the morning, I heard on the window: Knock, knock, knock. “Oh, no," I thought. “It's not happening!” I heard it again: Knock, knock, knock. And someone said my name. I had to get up. “This is it,” I thought. “They have found me out. They took my license plate number, found out at the border who was in the car, and tracked me down to this campground. I'm finished. This is the end." Then I opened the door, and a man said, “You have a telephone call.” I replied, “Oh, really, how nice!" I got up and went to the telephone. It was Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami, who was then Sucandra dāsa. He knew where I was because I had told him where I planned to stay. He informed me that Śrīla Prabhupāda had called from America and wanted me to meet him in London the very next day to become his secretary. I could understand that just because we tried to do a little service of smuggling books, Kṛṣṇa was directly offering His transcendental mercy.

sub=An Echo Throughout the Universe

The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to come to the topmost platform of love in separation from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu brought this understanding along with the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement for the benefit of all living entities. Lord Caitanya Himself was absorbed in this mood; therefore His devotees are following in His footsteps by continuing to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world with love in separation.

Kṛṣṇa enjoys in the spiritual world, but He also has some feeling of suffering. This is a wonderful thing. How can Kṛṣṇa suffer? Kṛṣṇa cannot suffer. Lord Caitanya cannot suffer. But He feels suffering in the sense that He wants to give His mercy to all the fallen souls. He is thinking, "Why are these foolish living entities suffering in the material world? When are they ever coming back to Me?”

Once Lord Caitanya lamented in this way to Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who intelligently replied, "My dear Lord, You already delivered all the living entities when you were in the Jhārikhanda forest.” When Lord Caitanya was walking around in the Jhārikhanda forest, He made all the animals dance. Tigers, lions, elephants, birds, and rabbits were dancing and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa together. Even deadly enemies, like tigers and deer, were hugging and kissing each other. This vibration of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> set in motion by Lord Caitanya echoed throughout the universe. Soon all the living entities, both moving and nonmoving, were vibrating the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em>. In this way, Lord Caitanya delivered living entities all over the universe and sent them back to Godhead. Then immediately those living entities who had not had manifested forms took such forms and filled up the spaces in the universe.

So now, as Lord Caitanya's devotees, our business is to continue that process and again clean the living entities out of the universe and send them all back home, back to Godhead.

title=The Life of All Transcendental Knowledge

sub=Planting the Seed of Bhakti

By the extraordinary mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the conditioned souls get the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em>. <em>Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</em>. We cannot imagine how fortunate such souls are nowadays when we are distributing so many books. We are giving them the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> after they have been wandering throughout the material world for millions of lifetimes. They may not know it, and we may not even realize it, but whoever agrees to take a book about Kṛṣṇa begins the process of <em>bhakti-yoga</em>. The seed is planted, but we don't even think about it when we distribute books, because it is too amazing—it is the most wonderful thing. The book distributors are the most magnanimous souls because they plant the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> in the hearts of all sorts of people who otherwise never would have a chance of going back to Godhead. Totally unfortunate souls become totally fortunate by the mercy of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

We are like farmers planting seeds, and some of these seeds will grow within our lifetime. But sometimes <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees become fruitive and ask, “We've been distributing so many books. Why isn't the temple filled with devotees?” The answer is, “Because that is not the way it works.” You have given a book about Kṛṣṇa to a completely conditioned soul who has been wrapped up in ignorance since time immemorial, and he has given you a donation. His spiritual life has started, but he may not complete it in this lifetime.

When you become a devotee and move into the temple, practically speaking, you are close to going back to Godhead. You have conquered over material nature to such a degree that you understand the only hope is to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and you dedicate your life to surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. This means you are close to surrendering fully; you are in the last stage.

In the beginning people should understand they are committing sinful activities. That is the first stage. They should at least understand that they are doing something wrong, but they don't even understand that. They think that slaughtering and eating animals and getting drunk is fine. They are steeped in ignorance. They don't know what is right and what is wrong.

But once people get in touch with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their spiritual lives will gradually begin. They will start to understand that they have to make a change. They will understand that the material world is not a nice place to live. Maybe they will visit Kṛṣṇa's temple. But guaranteed in the next life or in some lifetime, they will again do something Kṛṣṇa conscious and gradually advance further. Even if it takes one hundred lifetimes, this is nothing compared to the millions and millions of lifetimes they have undergone searching for Kṛṣṇa. They don't know they are searching for Kṛṣṇa, but that is what they are doing. Therefore <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is glorious because it gradually attaches all these people to the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Maybe they will take it now, maybe they will not. We cannot say. But we can say that they will become devotees some time, whereas before we met them and gave them a book they had no chance.

Book distribution is a long-range program to bring all conditioned souls back to Godhead. It also has short-term goals, namely, to distribute more books so that we can produce more books in other languages as well. The more book distribution goes on, the more people will understand about Kṛṣṇa. If only one percent of the people we give books to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, that is a lot of people. Planting the seed of <em>bhakti-yoga</em> is important work, because it gives people a chance to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

So much can be said about planting the <em>bhakti-latā-bija</em>, but you should meditate on it yourself when you are on the street. We should plant more and more seeds without stopping. Everything becomes lifeless when book distribution stops. But when book distribution is going on, everything is full of life, vigor, energy, and happiness. It is the life of all transcendental knowledge; it is an ocean of transcendental bliss —<em>ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam</em>; and it increases that ocean and gives us the taste for which we are always anxious.

We should be determined to continue this process because it is the best possible means to please Kṛṣṇa. There are so many living entities that Kṛṣṇa is not very happy with, but Kṛṣṇa becomes happy with you—the individual distributor—when you go on distributing this literature. Therefore we should never forget what we are doing, not even for a moment. We should always remember that the goal of this mission is to give every conditioned soul on this planet a chance to buy Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. If we can do this, we will be blessed by Kṛṣṇa's pure mercy and go right back home, back to Godhead.

sub=The Literary Incarnation

Love of Kṛṣṇa, the highest love that one can possibly have, is directly manifesting in Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. When the living entity gets one of these books, the perfection of his life is fulfilled because he gets Kṛṣṇa in his hands. Of the many incarnations and forms of the Lord, the most important one in this Age of Kali is the literary incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>.

In past ages, there were no books—there was only transcendental sound vibration. These sound vibrations are still vibrating—they are eternal, and they do not deteriorate—but because a gross body doesn't understand the eternal <em>Veda</em>, Śrīla Prabhupāda has captured the transcendental sound vibration in his books. His books contain the same eternal message that Kṛṣṇa explained to Arjuna, that Śukadeva Gosvāmī explained to Mahārāja Parīkṣit, and that the other <em>mahājanas</em> have explained to the devotees of the Lord since time immemorial. When these deep concepts from Kṛṣṇa go into the hearts of the living entities, the living entities become absorbed little by little in love of Godhead.

The <em>Bhāgavata-māhātmya</em> explains that one who gives away <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> on a full moon night gets liberation. Thus we will attain liberation by performing this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> activity, for we are giving out so many <em>Bhāgavatams</em> (not only on full moon nights but in other phases of the moon as well). No activity is greater. It directly connects us with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

sub=Putting Śrīla Prabhupāda in the Center

Our Kṛṣṇa conscious connection with Śrīla Prabhupāda is through his books. Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “I am living forever in these books.” So how can you not have a connection to the author if you read these books and distribute these books? You have him in your hands all day, every day.

One person accused us of not worshiping Śrīla Prabhupāda very nicely in this zone. He said, “Śrīla Prabhupāda is not in the center.” I rarely get angry, but when I heard that, I became very angry and said, “What does it mean to put Śrīla Prabhupāda in the center?" In every temple Prabhupāda is on the <em>vyāsāsana</em>, and we offer him <em>guru-pūjā</em>, flowers, and prayers. What does it mean to be in the center? That you offer a bigger garland? More flowers? Does it matter if you offer a bigger garland? Does that mean that you are a better devotee or that you have more love for Śrīla Prabhupāda? Maybe he didn't like wearing big garlands. What does it mean? To put Śrīla Prabhupāda in the center means you produce and distribute his books in every language of the world. If that is your main service, how can  Śrīla Prabhupāda not be the center of all your activities?

However, Śrīla Prabhupāda said that his books are not just for distribution—they are for reading. Therefore you should read these books. If you read Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and expertly learn the philosophy within them, Śrīla Prabhupāda will always be in the center of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

sub=How to Please the Spiritual Master

Śrīla Prabhupāda once explained, “The business of the spiritual master is to serve and please his spiritual master, and the business of the disciple is to assist his spiritual master in doing this.” If you want to please your spiritual master, you have to understand your position as a disciple. The disciple is simply meant for serving the spiritual master. What is that service? It is to become a perfect assistant in fulfilling the mission of the spiritual master's spiritual master.

The <em>guru</em> is only one person—what can he do alone? Although Śrīla Prabhupāda did everything alone, we personally are useless alone because we are not Śrīla Prabhupāda; we are just insignificant particles of dust, trying to offer Śrīla Prabhupāda something for his pleasure. Thus we are fully dependent on the mercy of our disciples.

Of course, the disciple is fully dependent on the mercy of the spiritual master. Without the mercy of the spiritual master, no one can make any advancement. If you don't spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by distributing books, I cannot please Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he will say, “What's wrong with you? You're not doing anything!” I will be as useless as you, and I will have to yell at you, "What's wrong with you? Why aren't you doing anything?" I will have no connection to Śrīla Prabhupāda and his mercy. If I cannot get Śrīla Prabhupāda's mercy, I cannot give you his mercy. Thus we will all remain in the material soup, wondering what is going on.

Therefore, if you want the mercy, you have to accept the mercy. The mercy is to serve the spiritual master by serving his mission and distributing as much Kṛṣṇa conscious literature as you possibly can. As soon as you accept that mission and endeavor to accomplish it, the mercy will immediately come. You cannot sit in a corner and wait for someone to plug you into the wall so that you can get juiced up with energy. Rather, as you utilize your own insignificant power, more energy comes.

All activities begin with desire. If you desire to engage in material activities, material nature helps you according to your karma. If you desire and endeavor spiritually, spiritual energy helps you according to your surrender and how much you please your spiritual master. And you please your spiritual master by endeavoring to serve the mission of his spiritual master. Śrīla Prabhupāda's mission is clear. It is for all of us. We have to take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement seriously, and we have to take the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books very seriously.

sub=Books Are the Basis

“Books are the basis” is not an idle phrase. If book distribution is not going on because some people have the idea in their heads that something is wrong with it, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will suffer and collapse. This movement will be strong again, like it was when Śrīla Prabhupāda was still here, when we understand that we are not proper disciples unless we distribute books.

Whatever preaching we do verbally is praiseworthy, but without book distribution talking is a waste of time. For example, we wrote a book about <em>varņāśrama-dharma</em> only because Śrīla Prabhupāda's books were being distributed. If books are not distributed, <em>varņāśrama-dharma</em> is mythology and to talk about it or anything else is worthless, because our connection with Śrīla Prabhupāda and the potency of our preaching comes from book distribution.

To consider yourself a disciple of mine, you also have to consider yourself a disciple of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda is the grandfather <em>guru</em>. Now, when the grandfather is so much more qualified than and superior to the father, the child looks up to the grandfather and takes inspiration from him just as the father does.

Naturally father and son have affection for each other, but in spiritual relationships the father has more affection for the grandfather. I have more affection for Śrīla Prabhupāda than I have for anyone else. All my feelings for the whole mass of my disciples don't compare to my feelings for Śrīla Prabhupāda. Every disciple should feel that way about his spiritual master.

sub=Close Down the Temple

Nothing is more important than book distribution; nothing comes even close. All cooking, cleaning, preaching, or managing is subordinate. If we go to sleep in the <em>māyā</em> of thinking that book distribution is inferior, we should lock the temple and go out and distribute books. The only thing that counts is this Kṛṣṇa conscious book distribution.

In 1974 Śrīla Prabhupāda sent everybody out to distribute books. In a famous letter, he told Śrī Govinda in Chicago to shut down the temple and leave one man to do the <em>pūjā</em> and manage. That year Prabhupāda told everyone to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> until we finally got it into our thick skulls that he wanted us to distribute his books. Only then did he tell some to stay back and do the <em>pūjā</em> and other things.

Thus we began to understand there must be a balance. At first we just chanted day and night on the street. Then we made temples and devotees. Then Śrīla Prabhupāda sent everyone back on the street to distribute books. And now we have a whole range of Kṛṣṇa conscious activities that we think are so important. But what did Śrīla Prabhupāda do every time we got such foolish ideas in our heads? He would say, “Stop everything you're doing, it's all nonsense! Go out on the street and preach!” He did this because we want to shut down our energy and take it easy in a comfortable living arrangement. But no one is happy in such living arrangements. We gradually sink into the mud and only get more distressed, because comfort in the material world means <em>māyā</em>, and as soon as you are in <em>māyā</em> you are miserable.

Therefore we have to get out of <em>māyā</em>, and the way to get out of <em>māyā</em> is to go out the door and distribute books! If you try all day and night as hard as you can and you only manage to do ten books, that is better than sitting around, thinking, “Oh, my ten books don't mean anything anyway.” This negative mentality anchors the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to the ground. But if everyone thinks, “I have to do it, I have to try, I have to struggle,” the whole movement takes off and flies, because this movement is worth nothing more than the members who make it up.

sub=Don't Get Out of Balance

We all have the responsibility to become perfect followers of our spiritual masters. Many have talked as if they were following properly, but in fact they were never following Śrīla Prabhupāda's instructions. One may say whatever one likes, but if one cannot follow the regulative principles and chant sixteen rounds a day, what is the use of such talk? Talk is cheap. Anyone can claim to be a disciple, but one must act like a disciple by having discipline. Disciple means discipline—it means we discipline our lives according to the instructions of the spiritual master.

Śrīla Prabhupāda has given us plenty of instructions, and we should follow all of them. He said that books are the basis, but he also said that purity is the force and utility is the principle. We cannot say that books are the basis and accept impurity, because purity is the force that maintains and expands the basis. We cannot say that utility is the principle and reject books as impractical and sell paraphernalia instead. We cannot talk about purity and not understand that without books there is no basis to purity. Without distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books we are not connected to Caitanya Mahāprabhu's plan to expand His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Utility and purity are useless without the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Thus there must be a balance between purity, utility, and the basis.

Therefore we accept all three. Continue to distribute books and push on this mission. Maintain the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Chant your rounds and hear them. All these principles must be practiced. Don't get out of balance! You can only maintain your activities within a structured Kṛṣṇa conscious society when you are properly balanced.

sub=The Vedānta of ISKCON

The only thing you must do in this life is know Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books and induce others to know them. Therefore we distribute books. Some may think that book distribution is a passionate activity that should not be talked about, but book distribution is the <em>Vedānta</em> of ISKCON.

You can only appreciate this activity of producing and distributing books when you understand the conclusion of the <em>Vedas</em>. The conclusion of the <em>Vedas</em> is to be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa, but one cannot be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa if one does not know Him. Knowing Kṛṣṇa can take many lifetimes, <em>bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate</em>. But when a person knows Kṛṣṇa, he will see Him everywhere, <em>vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti</em>. Such a person becomes like Prahlāda Mahārāja, unconcerned with bodily pleasures and pains. He is only interested in producing and distributing the Vedic literature in all the languages of the world, because he wants others to come to the same platform he has attained. This is an elite position, <em>sa mahātmā su-durlabhā</em>, the topmost platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Occasionally when I lecture on such points, some devotees become disturbed. For instance, they think that because I am such a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> fanatic I am against <em>gurukula</em>. That is foolish because I am also a <em>gurukula</em> fanatic. But what are we training the <em>gurukula</em> students for? To become first-class Vedāntists and first-class book producers and distributors, so they can break the teeth of the Māyāvādīs.

Everyone in ISKCON is trained to become a Vedāntist who can give <em>Vedānta</em> to others. For example, when a devotee who works with machines buys a machine part, he gives <em>Vedānta</em> to the man who supplies the parts by giving him a book. Also the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are experts at giving <em>Vedānta</em>; when they buy gas for the car, they pay with a book. Therefore, although a Vaiṣṇava devotee may go out to accomplish a <em>śūdra</em> activity, he goes out with <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spirit, and everyone he meets advances toward the path of <em>Vedānta</em>.

sub=Crystallization

Book distribution has unimaginable potency. Because of this book production and distribution, one of the biggest problems in the world is becoming crystallized.

Even if one is not able to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can understand that a separation is taking place between those with a demoniac nature and those with a leaning toward the divine, and the gap is widening. More people are gradually waking up and looking toward the mode of goodness - even in countries where they were oppressed.

Each book that goes out is another weight on the back of the demons, and they don't like it. Demons cannot tolerate glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They don't mind Bibles because nobody takes the Bible seriously, but our books really bother them because they see that our books have potency. “Where are those books?” they say. “Let us burn these horrible books that are ruining everything!” They confiscate the books, but the person in charge of destroying them steals a few and distributes them. The public censor, who reads the books to make sure they don't contain something that will pollute the minds of the people, likes the books and gives them to his children. The books are going everywhere, and the demons cannot stop it.

People addicted to the materialistic way of life cannot become Kṛṣṇa conscious. <em>Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram</em>: they are progressing toward the hellish regions. Such people may be friendly with you as long as it gratifies their senses, but they change as soon as you bring out a Kṛṣṇa conscious book. They take one look at it and scream and flee down the street like ghosts confronted with the cross of a priest. In the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, Arjuna says, “Your holy name is so potent that, upon Your appearance, the demons become afraid and flee here and there.” Sometimes devotees lament when these demons become angry, but that is the glorious proof of the potency of our books.

sub="You Are Brainwashed!”

Somebody may say that I am brainwashing you. But if you don't like to be brainwashed in this way, the door is over there. We have come together to be brainwashed. The brain is dirty. It has been filled with material contamination for many lifetimes. We take out bleach, ammonia, heavy detergents, and brushes, and we clean the brain. Then, after a lot of work, some rascal comes up and says, “You're brainwashed!” To that we should immediately reply, “You're a stool brain! If my brain is clean and you don't like it, that means you like filth and are in the mode of ignorance.” What is cleaner than a clean brain absorbed in the book distribution mission? Nothing! Therefore we don't mind being brainwashed.

Only those who are brainwashed can brainwash others. For example, if you ask a completely filthy person who has been outside in the dirt, mud, and grease to clean your room, he can attempt to clean it, but he will just leave streaks of filth everywhere. How can someone dirty clean anything? Those who scream, “You are brainwashed,” are just jealous because they cannot brainwash anybody. Still these envious rascals try to brainwash you by saying something like, “Those who sell books out on the street all day are zombies." But they are only throwing stool on the brain, and the first thing that happens when you listen to them is that books don't get produced or distributed.

sub=The Words of a Pure Devotee Are Always True

Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda, has said that simply by distributing these books we can change the world. His words will not prove false. Kṛṣṇa has proven time and time again that the words of a pure devotee are always true. Kṛṣṇa Himself always makes them true. So how can these words be untrue?

Śrīla Prabhupāda has said that these books will spark off a revolution in the impious hearts of a dull humanity. Revolution is a big word. It means an uprising against <em>māyā</em>. People will finally say that they don't want this garbage material existence anymore and that they want spiritual life.

Śrīla Prabhupāda once wrote in a letter to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, “Kṛṣṇa can give you the whole country in eighteen days if He wants, but you have to be qualified to accept it.” When we are all qualified Kṛṣṇa will give. He doesn't even need eighteen days; He can do it in eighteen minutes if He wants. It depends on whose desire is stronger, ours or the demons'. If the demons' desire to enjoy is stronger, they will keep these places; and if we can distribute books and change people's desires, Kṛṣṇa will help us more.

One must have faith in Śrīla Prabhupāda's words. So many rascals pretending to be devotees have made big words yet have no faith in Śrīla Prabhupāda's mission. They neither produce books nor distribute them. They say that they are great, and if you look for results, they have no results. But if you look for results from those who have faith in Śrīla Prabhupāda's words, they are producing and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Although there are many services besides book distribution, these services are usually done by persons who cannot distribute books. Our organisational principle is that everyone who can goes out to do battle and whoever is left over does everything else. Then those left in the temple lament because they also want to participate in this wonderful mission that brings the topmost perfection of life.

sub=The Purpose of the Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Movement

The purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not to grow food or produce children. It is not to make offices and telephone calls. It is not to fix cars or cut the grass. It is not to program computers, put wires on walls, or build machines. The purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to use these things to make and distribute books.

Some may think that "advanced” is when you become a householder, do some moneymaking business, and worship the Deity; but no, that is <em>vaiśya</em> class, and we want to train up <em>brāhmaṇas</em>. A <em>brāhmaṇa</em> knows Brahman, <em>brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇah</em>, and he teaches and gives Brahman to others. Brahman is Parabrahman, Kṛṣṇa, and this <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> is Kṛṣṇa. <em>Kṛṣṇe sva-dhāmopagate dharma</em>. We are distributing Kṛṣṇa in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>.

Don't think that only <em>bhaktas</em> should do book distribution. Besides, if after so many years you are not a <em>bhakta</em>, then what are you? You are in <em>māyā</em>. Everybody is a <em>bhakta</em> all the time. <em>Bhakta</em> means devotee of Kṛṣṇa; a devotee of Kṛṣṇa is always interested in distributing these books.

Sometimes people say, “If you only produce and distribute books, then Kṛṣṇa consciousness doesn't expand.” But we have seen that even if you don't do anything else but distribute books, the movement expands automatically. And if you distribute books and do something else, the movement also expands. But if you do something else and don't distribute books, it doesn't expand at all. Therefore the purpose of everything we do is to expand the book distribution.

sub=Saṅkīrtana-yajña Is the Yuga-dharma

In Kali-yuga, when three quarters of irreligiosity has been introduced and the remaining one quarter of religiosity (truthfulness) is quickly being diminished, the only prescribed method of sacrifice is the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Through this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission mankind will be able to obtain grains, the proper food for human society. Nowadays so many places on this planet do not have enough food because people are not engaged in the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>.

Only by the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> can one get free from the disturbances of life. It is the primary benediction for humanity. Hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa, remembering Kṛṣṇa, and distributing His transcendental literature transforms one's life. We have seen that whenever somebody is having difficulties, if he goes out and distributes books, especially during a marathon, his whole life immediately transforms into a blissful <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>. One cannot speak enough about the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>. It is so refreshing and relaxing, and it frees one from intense problems.

sub=The Service Is the Reward

This book distribution mission is a lifelong mission. It is not something that you only do during the marathon so that you can read your name in the newsletter and think, “Look at me! Eighty million points." You should not expect everybody to scream your name from the rooftops, nor should you expect a prize. This is a mission, and you simply participate in the mission.

When Kṛṣṇa returned to the <em>rāsa-lilā</em>, He told the <em>gopīs</em>, “My dear <em>gopīs</em>, I am not able to repay My debt for your spotless service. Therefore, kindly let your service itself be your reward.” For a devotee the service alone is payment; a devotee does not do business. Had Kṛṣṇa told the <em>gopīs</em>, "My dear <em>gopīs</em>, you are serving Me spotlessly; therefore you can all have golden bangles," that would be like being a prostitute: "You give Me pleasure, and I give you golden bangles.” Had Kṛṣṇa even made such a proposal, the <em>gopīs</em> would have been deeply insulted. But they were thankful, because their service alone was the reward.

The fact that you, out of millions of people, are engaged in the topmost ecstatic service in existence proves that you are greatly blessed. To take some other reward would be business. We do not accept salaries. A salary would be an insult to pure devotion. We engage in the service to satisfy the Supreme Lord, and that itself is the reward.

sub=Paramātmā Is Also a Saṅkīrtana Devotee

<em>Paramātmā</em> is within the heart of the conditioned souls, waiting for them to turn to Him. If even in the slightest way He sees some sincerity in a person's heart, He responds by telling him, "All right now, go there, do this. See, there is a devotee. Go to him. Ask him something." All of a sudden the conditioned soul has some deep inspiration in his heart to want a book, and he is drawn like a magnet to it. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out money that he would ordinarily waste on sense gratification. He gives it to the devotee. He would normally never give money to someone he doesn't even know. Why should he trust or buy anything from someone he meets on the street? Because the Supersoul within the heart has mercifully ordered him to. He sees the neatly wrapped book and thinks, "At least it's a new book," and he takes it.

sub=Saṅkīrtana Pleases Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī

By distributing books, we are working to help bring the conditioned souls in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the same service Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī engages in with Her devotees. She is always getting great bliss from making arrangements for the other <em>gopīs</em> to meet Kṛṣṇa and become blissfully engaged in His personal service. It brings Her even more pleasure than directly serving does. This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> activity is therefore glorious—by connecting people with Kṛṣṇa we are performing the activity most pleasing to Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

Of course, the whole Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is  <em>saṅkīrtana</em> activity. Chanting the holy names of the Lord and preaching His glories in schools and universities are part and parcel of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> activity. Therefore we should go on increasing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> by increasing book distribution, preaching, <em>prasādam</em> distribution, and distribution of the holy name of the Lord. These activities are all extremely pleasing to Śrīla Prabhupāda, the previous <em>ācāryas</em>, and, ultimately, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

sub=Street Samādhi

<em>Samādhi</em> means to be fully absorbed in one's worshipful object. For a devotee, <em>samādhi</em> means being fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa. The more he can do this, the more he falls into the category of being in <em>samādhi</em>. <em>Samādhi</em> is not something impossible to attain if one is always absorbed in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord. A book distributor can enter into this stage of <em>samādhi</em> even on the street. He enters <em>samādhi</em> when he is fully absorbed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. When it becomes his only thought and meditation, he enters <em>samādhi</em> because of his sincere dedication.

But there is no way to stay on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> unless you become purified, and there is no way to become fully purified unless you do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is the means and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is also the end. It is the means by which you can best serve and glorify Kṛṣṇa, and it is the way in which you can become glorified and glorious as Kṛṣṇa's servant. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is an amazing service—you become purified by just continuing. I can guarantee that any person who does <em>saṅkīrtana</em> for ten years has the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa fixed within his heart. I can also guarantee that if you engage in the Kṛṣṇa conscious <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement for this one lifetime, you will go back to Godhead. Stamped and guaranteed!

title=Print Books!

sub=The Original Book Production Marathon

Śrīla Prabhupāda was producing the first volumes of his <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> as he was writing them at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. He had to oversee the production at every step, beginning with buying paper at the market. In India, it is not possible to simply order paper and expect that it will be delivered by truck to your front door. You must go to the manufacturer and choose from eight million different varieties of paper. You must see it being put on the wagon and walk with it to the printer yourself—or else that which arrives is guaranteed to be different from what you have ordered, much less than what you have paid for, of a lower quality, and completely dirty and messed up.

Therefore Śrīla Prabhupāda went to the paper merchant, chose the appropriate paper, bought what he needed, saw it being put on a hand cart, walked with it to the printer, delivered it, and got written confirmation. Then he would watch the first sheets being run off, and he would even correct them, being the writer, editor, and proofreader himself. Then he would buy the binding material and bring it to the bindery. In India, a book is bound by a group of old ladies who sit together in one room on the floor. They fold the pages by hand, and then, holding the loose pages with their feet, they sew it all together. Then these handbound books would have to be brought to another place for the covers to be put on. Again, the fabric for the cover must be bought beforehand. Then the fabric is handstretched over a piece of cardboard and the title is stamped on by hand. Finally, the cover is stuck onto the book with glue that has been brushed on by hand and a dust jacket is printed.

Nowadays we produce Śrīla Prabhupāda's books with a staff of ten to fifteen people—a translator, an editor, proofreaders, typists, composers, typesetters, layoutmen, cameramen—but Śrīla Prabhupāda produced his books alone, with a technology that was primitive. The type was set with single-lettered lead type. They didn't even have Linotypes, which produce one line at a time. How Śrīla Prabhupāda went through all these different stages is beyond the understanding of those of us used to making books with machines.

And at the same time that he was producing his books, he was writing a topical newspaper, the original <em>Back to Godhead</em>, wherein he made relevant comments on the hot news of the day. He would sell his newspaper to people while they sat in cafés and restaurants sipping their tea. He once told me that the Delhi streets were so hot that he was swooning as he walked along. One time he fainted from the heat and was almost run over by a car, but he was saved by a well-wishing passerby. Despite these difficulties he would go out and distribute his books and newspapers; and with the donations from these sales and a few other sources, he would buy more paper and gradually go on printing his books.

He went on printing his books even though he didn't have a clear idea how to sell them. He tried selling them through bookstores, but they were not moving very fast. He placed them in libraries and universities. And he presented them to the Prime Minister, who greatly appreciated them. From a mundaner's point of view, this was pure pounds, shillings, and pence business and had nothing to with spiritual life. But amazingly, Śrīla Prabhupāda was working just for Kṛṣṇa and his spiritual master, who had given him the mission to preach in the English language so that all the people of the world could benefit.

sub=Śrīla Prabhupāda's Request

We want to do everything according to Śrīla Prabhupāda's plan. He said, “I have given you the framework of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Now it is up to you to expand it by filling in the structure.” Therefore we like to fill in the framework with walls of books. Floors are not made out of books, for we don't walk on them. But walls of books are very nice, and we fill up the rooms with books too. Śrīla Prabhupāda told me in India, “I have many bank accounts. Empty them all out and just print books! Then fill up the temples with these books and bring the devotees together and tell them, “There is no more place to sleep. Now you must distribute a pile of books as big as you need for sleeping before you can take rest tonight.' And while they are out doing that, fill in the pile with more books for the next day.” He was serious. He wanted it done right then on the spot. He told me, “This man in charge of India is a miser. He is not giving out the books. Therefore I give you all my money. Just print and distribute books."

To this day we are using all of Śrīla Prabhupāda's <em>lakṣmi</em> in the same way. Nothing else is more important than producing books, regardless of what someone might say. So many times Śrīla Prabhupāda said what was important. Someone who did not associate very much with Śrīla Prabhupāda or surrender very much may not understand Prabhupāda's deep desires, but we can tell you for certain that we know what he wants it all begins with books, is sustained with books, and culminates with books. He wants the people to take his books, read them, and go back home, back to Godhead.

sub=Wake Up! Make Books!

Although we are concerned with everything, we are mainly concerned with printing and distributing books. Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are more important than anything else because producing and distributing these books is the primary way to worship Kṛṣṇa in the Age of Kali. We also like to worship the Deity and would never give that up, but if you compare the time we spend worshiping the Deity with the time we spend making books, you can understand the difference. A few of us crazy fanatics just make books all day and night, and we don't go anywhere else. I admit that I am a fanatic about making these books. There is no question about it. What can I do? Somebody has to be a fanatic.

No temple in the world is as happy as that temple where everybody is running around making books. Where book production is going on, there is all success; but where no book production or distribution is going on, there is no success. Therefore, in every one of our temples, we either print or distribute books; and where we do both, the ecstasy is doubled.

We love BBT fanatics. Others we love too, but those in the BBT who are not fanatics are traitors. It is blasphemy. Either you are a fanatic or you don't count. That is a radical point of view, but somehow Śrīla Prabhupāda instilled this madness in us; we cannot get rid of it, and we wouldn't even think of trying. He instilled complete, transcendental insanity within this unfortunate soul. “Make books! Make books! Make books!" rings in my head all day and night, and “Print books! Print books! Print books!" bounces off the walls of my skull. If we can produce more fanatics with this instruction constantly ringing in their heads, we will be very happy. We will haunt you. We will stand on your shoulder and scream in your ear: "Wake up! Make books!"

I am not going to be happy until every one of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is available in every language of the world. Do you realize what this adds up to? If at the end of this lifetime we have filled ten rooms as big as this one* with different volumes of Prabhupāda's books, our birth will not have been in vain. BBT devotees should meditate day and night on how to achieve this goal. Nothing else is as important, because achieving this expands every other aspect of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement automatically.

sub=Print Books and Everything Will Be a Success

I say like a madman, “The basis of everything is producing books,” because the <em>rasa</em> of producing books like mad makes you totally insane. You don't do anything anymore the way normal people do. You become crazy. If you don't run around screaming, “Make books!” all day long, you are in <em>māyā</em> to one degree or another. Unless you make so many books that the machines blow up from overuse, you are not doing anything.

Everything good happens when you produce Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. It is mystical. I have seen in Germany that when we are producing books like madmen, the whole place becomes like Vaikuṇṭha. Everything starts developing: people start joining, money comes pouring in, the demons leave us alone. But as soon as <em>māyā</em> manages to trip us up, and book production stops, everything bad happens: the demons become big, we have money problems, nobody joins, people run away. Therefore I have concluded that the secret to success in all things is to make books. If you want to have a successful <em>gurukula</em> or farm, you just make books. And the way to cause disaster is to stop making books.

Śrīla Prabhupāda's program was to just print books and not worry about how they are going to be distributed. As the devotees see all the wonderful books come pouring out, they realize that they have to distribute them. You don't even have to give fired-up <em>saṅkīrtana</em> lectures—it happens automatically. As soon as you start making these books like complete madmen, Kṛṣṇa makes everything happen.

When I read how Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura dealt with Śrīla Prabhupāda in the first volume of the <em>Śrīla Prabhupāda-lilāmṛta</em>, I can see that Śrīla Prabhupāda dealt with me similarly, although at the time I didn't understand these dealings. Śrīla Prabhupāda said to me many times, “You just preach to scholars, religionists, and philosophers. They will benefit, you will benefit, and all of mankind will be benefited. You just go out and preach, and if you ever get any money, print books.” Again and again he would say, “Oh, how my spiritual master was so satisfied just to see books printed!” He would always tell me about making books. He would say, "Your responsibility is to make every one of my books in every language on this planet.”

Therefore I can understand that the production of this transcendental literature is the primary mission, the vanguard of our movement. Everything else follows in a chain reaction automatically. ISKCON is like a big rocket, of which book production is the nose cone and book distribution the fuel stage.

sub=Pile Up the Books

We don't mind that devotees are engaged in many ways; but if nobody is preaching, we become very disturbed. Therefore we always want to be engaged in the only way that we can preach nicely to people—the book distribution mission. Radio preaching is also nice, but what will we say apart from what is in the books? And when people become a little favorable, what is the first thing we do? We give them a set of books! Thus the real potency comes from Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, and all other things are the servants of his books. Prabhupāda emphasized this in so many ways. Maybe I didn't learn very much from him, but I learned this. He drilled it into my head, and it will never go out!

Many personalities do many different services in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Śrīla Prabhupāda appreciated even the smallest service—those who cooked nicely, washed the floor nicely, or whatever the service might be —as long as it was carried out with enthusiasm. But I like to do nothing more than pile up books on his desk, because that is what he said I should do. I would write many letters to Śrīla Prabhupāda, describing my plans to preach in different ways, but Prabhupāda simply answered, “I don't care to hear about all these things. I will simply be satisfied to see the books piling up on my desk.”

Every year we go to Mayapur with a stack of books, and we sneak into Prabhupāda's room and pile the books on his desk without even arranging them nicely, because that is what he wants. I enjoy that moment very much, because to produce and distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books in places where it is strictly forbidden, in corners of the world that we cannot even write about in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> newsletter, is so much work, and there seems to be very little appreciation. But when we pile those books on his desk, it makes it all worthwhile.

sub=We Have No Other Mood

Toward the end of Śrīla Prabhupāda's manifested pastimes on the planet, I brought him an offering of books that was significant then, but nowadays we would not even consider it a month's production. This little pile of books included a Yugoslavian <em>Īśopaniṣad</em> produced in a super <em>mahā</em> marathon.

A theosophist in Yugoslavia, who was not a devotee nor very intelligent, had made a good translation, so we had it typeset in Frankfurt by a nice lady named Becker. This lady made a marathon because I told her that Śrīla Prabhupāda's condition was bad; we didn't know how long he would live, so I wanted to offer him as many books as I could to inspire him to go on living. Somehow she understood and dedicated all her time to typesetting this <em>Īśopaniṣad</em> for Śrīla Prabhupāda. She put aside all other jobs and finished the book in a couple of days.

She was a super pro. Books were not typeset then by computerized typesetting machines. They were done by hand on special composing typewriters that made ink-on-paper copies. When we got a stack of these paper copies from her, I worked the whole night laying out the book. By the time I had finished I could hardly see the pages. Yet the next morning a Yugoslavian boy and I went to the typesetting shop, where we all worked together in one room; he proofread, she composed, and I made the corrections.

Three days prior to this I had been to our printers, Mohndruck. I also had explained to them about Śrīla Prabhupāda's condition, which meant a lot to them since we were big customers. I said that I wanted to produce this book for him but they only had one day to do it. They would get the original draft of the book by five-thirty in the afternoon, but we needed the book back in our hands by seven o'clock the next morning, completely printed. This job normally takes two or three weeks. One must make transparencies, do opaquing or scratching, check it, and make a montage before it can be printed; and one must print the cover and the pages before it is bound. They were scratching their heads because no one in history had ever asked them to do something like this before, but they mobilized their entire company and just did it—the most purifying thing they had ever done in their lives.

The printers were in Bielefeld, but we were producing the original flats for the books in Frankfurt, an almost four-hour's drive away. We had a running car waiting outside with a devotee in it who loved to drive like a madman. We told him, “This time it's authorized and bona fide to drive as fast as you want,” gave him the flats, and he drove off like a madman. The printers, who had been working all night, gave the printed and bound book to our driver, who drove back like a madman, and I had the book in my hand by the time I got on the plane for India.

Meanwhile, another marathon was going on at another printer down south in Ulm. They were printing, in German, three <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books and the Second Canto in two volumes. But they couldn't cut and put together the covers in time. So with a cutter in my office at Schloss Rettershof, we cut and put on the covers ourselves.

Then I flew off to India. When I gave the books to Śrīla Prabhupāda, the mood in the room changed. He focused his attention entirely on the books. He was very appreciative and looked at them for a long time. When he saw the Yugoslavian <em>Īśopaniṣad</em>, his first question was, "Can you distribute this book?” Knowing well there was no way to distribute it, for the Yugoslavian preaching program at that time consisted of myself and one assistant, I said, “Certainly, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we will distribute these books," and he replied, "Good. As soon as you can distribute some books, you should reprint them.”

If you truly love someone, you are only interested in what he wants. Therefore, to please Śrīla Prabhupāda, we constantly push to produce and distribute books. Everything else is just decoration, icing on the cake —but book production and distribution is the cake. This is how we feel. We don't mind if people disagree, but we have no other mood.

sub=How Śrīla Prabhupāda Appears

Śrīla Prabhupāda's disappearance day used to be a horrible affair for me because I had always been dependent on his personal presence for shelter. Once I was lamenting to him because I wanted to have a more loving relationship with my superior Godbrothers, and he told me, “They will never appreciate, no matter what you do, but I have recognized and Kṛṣṇa has recognized; isn't that enough?” I realized then how my relationship with Śrīla Prabhupāda is a personal one; but when he left, where was that relationship?

I have been understanding more and more that the only relationship I have with Śrīla Prabhupāda is through his books. And because his books are his glory, I want to print and distribute these books all over the world. He may have disappeared from this planet personally, but he appears constantly in new languages and different cultures. Śrīla Prabhupāda will live forever in his books. He is his books, and his purports are his transcendental ecstasies. They can change the life of a fallen soul who has had no contact with Prabhupāda and is somewhere far away. Therefore on Śrīla Prabhupāda's disappearance day, I wanted to glorify him by showing how he appears.

Although many ways to glorify Śrīla Prabhupāda are being presented wonderfully on this occasion, I would like to present and explain a little bit about these newly produced books—not only for Śrīla Prabhupāda's pleasure, but also to emphasize the importance of this glorious activity. Prabhupāda always liked to show off to people the wonderful and important message being spread throughout the world in the form of his books.

Today we are offering for Śrīla Prabhupāda's pleasure twenty-two books in eight different languages. The smallest book is the only book Śrīla Prabhupāda ever specifically asked me to make. Six years ago he asked me to make this book. Because of many difficulties it has taken a long time to complete this task, but because Prabhupāda considered this translation important and because he desired it, we have been able to complete it. This book contains, in Russian, the <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> and three other small books from Prabhupāda's lecture series. It is in a small form because it goes to a demoniac place. Nevertheless, KGB agents thought that they would get on our good side if they helped us translate it. We are grateful for their unwitting assistance. They even helped us smuggle the Russian <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> into the country.

Everybody should take up this mission to print and distribute Prabhupāda's books throughout the world. This already is being done wonderfully in many places, but this world is big and we are few. If you really want to grab the mercy of Śrīla Prabhupāda's lotus feet, I advise you to go to a country where Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not yet established, translate Śrīla Prabhupāda's books into the local language, distribute them, and see how many people come to Kṛṣṇa. You can get the spark within your heart and capture the mood that Śrīla Prabhupāda had when he started this movement in the mid-sixties. Giving people Prabhupāda's books and the holy name is the most wonderful way to glorify Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “You can judge the result of your preaching according to how many books are being distributed.” I remember January 1977, when Bhaktibhūṣaṇa and Bhaktivaibhava Mahārājas were distributing books in Poland, Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote, “I have heard about your preaching activities. They are very nice, but I also have heard that you are distributing my books. Now I know everything will be a success because wherever my books are distributed the preaching will be successful.”

footnote=* The room was big enough to hold approximately 70,000 <em>mahā</em> books; thus ten rooms would mean 700,000 <em>mahā</em> books.

title=Saṅkīrtana Management

sub=Saṅkīrtana Devotees Are Especially Dear

All devotees are dear to the Supreme Lord because they engage in His devotional service, but the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are especially dear because they instruct people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees should be specially cared for, because they support the temple economically and spiritually. This means the temple president makes sure that they have the best equipment to perform their mission and that they get nice treatment in the temple.

sub=Śrīla Prabhupāda's Economic Scheme

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted book distribution to maintain this movement. Other businesses are not Prabhupāda's scheme. I heard him say many times how he wanted it done: First the BBT prints the books and charges you one hundred percent more than the production cost. Then you distribute the books for one hundred percent more than the BBT price. You maintain your temple on fifty percent of your income and fifty percent goes to the BBT. Then the BBT uses fifty percent of its income to print more books, so that every book that goes out is replaced. Thus you can distribute unlimited books and the BBT will just keep printing. If followed, this principle makes economic problems disappear, and following it is easy. First make book distribution the sole economic scheme. <em>Gṛhasthas</em> living outside can devise other schemes if they wish, but the temple devotees should make money only from book distribution. If book distribution is the sole means of income, and they sell the books for the right price, twice the BBT price, then they can use half the money for books and half for the temple. The price might be adjusted by the local GBC if the books must go out as fast as possible or the people haven't got enough money to pay for them, but the temple will have some economic troubles because of this and will have to adjust. If a temple manages to live on the basis of book distribution by the fifty-fifty principle, however, then more and more devotees can be persuaded to sell more and more books because nobody needs to do anything else to bring in money. The BBT will become bigger and bigger, the projects in India will come closer and closer to completion, and Lord Caitanya, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and Śrīla Prabhupāda will all be very pleased because Prabhupāda wanted the projects like Mayapur to be built through book distribution. He said that if we kept doubling book distribution every year, we would have enough funds to build a big temple in Mayapur.

sub=Back to the Basics

Sometime in 1975, Śrīla Prabhupāda was in Bombay, and I was sitting in his room when one GBC man came in and presented Prabhupāda with a scheme to distribute all the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛtas</em> being printed at full speed. He said that since the books had a striking appearance and the contents were highly advanced, the devotees would have problems distributing them; furthermore, the BBT needed the capital to print these books and at the same time donate seventy-five thousand dollars a month to the Bombay construction. His scheme was to give out books without regard for the donation size and cover the missing portion of the price with other collection methods. I don't think the forceful presentation of this scheme disturbed Prabhupāda, but he was not happy when he heard that his books would be given away for less than their value. Prabhupāda was adamant that no books should be given away for free. People should pay for them; otherwise they would not respect them. But when the GBC man said, “Well, Prabhupāda, if we don't do this, book distribution will decrease by two-thirds,” Prabhupāda looked down at the floor in what seemed to me to be sad resignation and said, “If it will decrease the distribution, do as you must." In my mind the idea is fixed that Prabhupāda felt somewhat threatened. I have kept this to myself throughout the years so as not to make a scene about it, but the image remains burned into my mind, and Prabhupāda's desire is clear.

We have to understand the desire of the spiritual master: his desire is to distribute books. If his disciples are too rock-headed to understand the whole principle, then his attitude is, “All right, what can I say? After all, you are doing the service.” Since we were sitting right next to Prabhupāda at that moment, and since he expressed his desire in many ways, we want to strictly follow Śrīla Prabhupāda's original ideas without any mental concoction. We are asking you to take up this program because it was Prabhupāda's idea, and if you do, everything will be spiritually and economically solid. Śrīla Prabhupāda saw book distribution as the spiritual and economic basis of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Whenever anybody asked him how he supported this big organization, he would say, "We are distributing three <em>lakhs</em> of books a day. In this way we support all our temples.” He repeated it thousands of times to any Indian who would ask. Yet nowadays what temple supports itself by books? The spiritual master says that it is done by books, but the disciple does it by paintings, bumper stickers, and stamps. So it may be troublesome for you, but we will take the trouble to get back to what Prabhupāda wanted. He said, “Just distribute books and everything will come,” and it is a fact. From book distribution comes money, preaching opportunities, new devotees. People read the books and become favorable. We cannot understand the depth or reach of these books. Therefore I insist that book distribution be our main preaching. It was Prabhupāda's desire and he told me so. We don't need to hear anything else. We will print, distribute, and try our best to maintain our temples with Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

sub=The Best Business

Book distribution is the only hope for maintaining our society, because distribution of paraphernalia—paintings, bumper stickers, or whatever people are distributing nowadays—will not give us strength. People will look at this and laugh at us: “Look at these so-called spiritual people. They engage in all sorts of paraphernalia sales just to make money.” Also the devotees will develop a fruitive mentality and their spiritual life will diminish, because they don't have a direct connection to the preaching mission.

One may manage to collect a lot of money from paraphernalia sales and start an opulent center. But then one depends on a high level of income to maintain it. And this is difficult because devotees cannot continue to stay out late and associate with <em>karmis</em> in unpleasant circumstances. They gradually give up, and one cannot replace them because such activities do not attract new devotees. Then one takes out loans, thinking that they can be paid back later on, but the center just becomes more and more overextended and soon collapses. We have seen it happen again and again.

On the other hand, book distribution strengthens spiritual life. The devotees who go out and sell books become enlivened, ecstatic, and regulated in sleeping and rising. They are able to chant properly and associate with the other devotees. They are not on programs in which they go to bed at midnight or one in the morning and get up at eight or nine o'clock as all the other devotees are walking out the door. All the devotees connected with the book distribution become strong together. And they are interested in reading the books because they are distributing them all the time.

Nobody has gotten on the case of any temple for distributing books. And the money from distributing books has never become the target of the tax authorities or government people as long as it has been collected in a fairly decent manner. Straightforward book distribution never disturbed anybody anywhere in the world, because it is understood that we are selling our books as part of our religion. Money made in that way is secure, because it is untouchable and usually tax exempt.

Śrīla Prabhupāda said that book distribution is the best business. He even said that our householders could maintain themselves by distributing books and could take a commission, fifteen percent or whatever is required to maintain themselves. Of course, that was in Prabhupāda's time. Today it is more like fifty percent. In this way they have a personal income and are not dependent on the temple. They give money to the temple, and they support the BBT. It is the best occupational duty for every householder in the movement. It is the way that all householders can have their own places, do a lot of preaching, and be very satisfied in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

sub=Preaching Against Book Distribution Is Insanity

When we were preaching in Poland, Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “I know your preaching is successful because you are distributing so many of my books.” If someone preaches against book distribution, he must be insane because Prabhupāda's greatest desire was to have his books distributed. Everyone knows it. No research is required. But some choose to remember it and others choose to forget it. We distribute books on the order of the superior authority—the preaching mission depends on it. Therefore everyone giving orders in ISKCON should pass on the order of the higher authority that everyone engage in the preaching mission, of which book distribution is the topmost activity. We should distribute these books like mad, and this will bring people's consciousness to the transcendental platform and change the world.

sub=Creating a Saṅkīrtana Atmosphere

I see my role in the book distribution mission as making sure that all the activities of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in all the temples are directed toward getting out as many books as possible and making sure that all the devotees understand that this is the main goal: we have to bring more and more people to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by giving them Prabhupāda's books. To do this we have to create an atmosphere in which book distribution is seen as very, very important work.

Actually, from the material point of view, nobody wants to go out and sell books. It is strenuous. It is difficult meeting adverse conditions and people. This is an important consideration. Unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he will want to do things according to his material inclinations more than anything else. Therefore inspiring the devotees to go out is not easy if the atmosphere in the temples is unfavorable to book distribution. If all the devotees are busily engaged according to their propensities, a potential book distributor might think, “Why should I struggle to distribute books?” Therefore one has to create an atmosphere in which everyone can understand with his transcendental intelligence that book distribution is the most important activity, that it is going to bring the supreme results and please Śrīla Prabhupāda and take us all back to Godhead. It is the primary purpose of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and Prabhupāda said that enough times so that everyone can understand it.

Yet it is important to preach in such a way that devotees who don't distribute books can feel they are connected to book distribution. Our managers have to help everybody understand this. For example, the <em>pūjārī</em> department worships the Deity and assures us of the Lord's mercy, and we aspire to please the Deities and want to distribute the books for Their satisfaction. Therefore at the end of the week we read our book scores to Them. And the cooks prepare <em>prasādam</em> to give everybody strength and enthusiasm. Especially in December practically all of us simply engage in book distribution just to make sure we keep up the spirit of understanding what the topmost part of preaching is.

sub=Old Distributors Never Die

<strong>Devotee:</strong> If book distribution is the topmost activity, why do most devotees give it up after some years? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> There are many reasons to give up book distribution, and none of them are bona fide. I know many old book distributors who are still book distributors. Sometimes, because the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men are the most qualified, we make an older <em>saṅkīrtana</em> man temple president. Then he becomes not only the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader for a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> group, but for the whole temple. He hasn't given up. He may not be able to go out all the time and distribute books himself, but he inspires everyone else to participate in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. And that is glorious.

One should never give up the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Even if a devotee has to give up direct street distribution because his body is broken down from carrying tons of books, he can still help others to go out and distribute books. Only the form of distribution has changed. To engage everybody else in book distribution is a higher service than to be engaged in it oneself, and only one sincerely committed to the book distribution mission can do it. Someone not convinced may talk big and inspire the devotees for ten minutes or so, but they soon realize he is a nonsense and forget about him. But a real book distributor at heart can inspire hundreds of thousands of people to distribute Prabhupāda's books. Old <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees never die—they live forever in their instructions.

An old distributor can make preaching programs, inspiring people to start <em>nāma-haṭṭa</em> centers and distribute books themselves. He can also encourage the <em>nāma-haṭṭīs</em> to read the books, for the more they read and study the books the more they will want to distribute them. Can you imagine when we have a network of <em>nāma-haṭṭa</em> centers all over the place, and in each of these centers a couple goes out and distributes maybe twenty books a week? It doesn't sound like much, but if you have a hundred centers, that is two thousand books a week distributed by householders going from door to door in their own neighborhoods. Can you imagine, little by little, a huge book distribution network spreading over every country, flooding every place with books?

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees should pray to the Lord for the strength to continue even though their bodies are aging. After ten or fifteen years on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, you should not give up, thinking, “Now I'm too old.” No, you are still not old. Prabhupāda used to say that old is when you are in your seventies. Of course, from his point of view it was like that. So if you are an old man and your hair is gray and you need a cane to walk, you can still preach and inspire more and more people to distribute books. This is actually the way a book distributor thinks. He thinks that his whole life will be engaged in distributing Prabhupāda's books.

sub=Special Delivery

Eating, drinking, and being merry you can do in any body, but only in the human form of life can you go back home, back to Godhead. We want to give out billions and trillions of books, because we don't want people to eat, drink, be merry, and tomorrow die. We want them to eat <em>prasādam</em>, drink nectar, be merry in <em>kīrtana</em>, and tomorrow go back home, back to Godhead. Therefore we will not be satisfied until every house has a full set and a spare set, and we are not going to rest until this has been done. We may become so old that we need a young <em>brahmacārī</em> to carry our book bag, but we will still be giving out the books. We will go on until we drop dead on the street with a book in our hand. Then a special crew with a special van will pick up our dead body and deliver us to a special place where all the <em>samādhis</em> for <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are. We will be put in our <em>samādhi</em> with that last book along with a flower garland on our chest, and a nice <em>samādhi</em> building will be built over us. Isn't that nice? So just go on with this transcendental mission that Śrīla Prabhupāda has given us, and everything will become very wonderful.

sub=Fresh Blood

No matter how well we do, the same devotees going out year after year become old. Of course, old <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees never die, they just go on distributing, but due to the age factor they may do a little less or a different kind of book distribution. Therefore to keep the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement increasing we must always be on the alert to make new devotees. When new devotees are in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> parties, their enthusiasm will inspire all the devotees. But how do new devotees come to the temple? They come through preaching programs. Therefore many preaching programs should be arranged. One or two expert preachers can go around and attract people to visit the temple. The whole purpose of preaching programs is to make new devotees. And when those new devotees are around, we should gradually bring them out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. When the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party increases, we can have really successful <em>saṅkīrtana</em>

Therefore the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have to cooperate with the preachers. If you meet somebody who looks nice—I don't mean an old housewife with a bag of groceries, I mean a seventeen- to twenty-five-year-old person who is not entangled yet with family, house, job, and all of that—get that person's address and make sure the preachers contact him or her. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have to cooperate and collect addresses even though it takes five minutes out of their distribution. It is worth it in the long run. One has to see every person as a potential devotee and gradually develop the base of devotees, so that more and more <em>saṅkīrtana</em> can go on. This is essential, and everyone should be praying all the time to the Lord to increase the number of devotees.

Desire is the main factor in increasing book distribution. The more one desires it, the more one prays to Kṛṣṇa for help to accomplish it. And Kṛṣṇa reciprocates by sending qualified devotees. If these new devotee candidates are properly trained in the process of book distribution and are nicely performing this service, Kṛṣṇa will see that we are serious to increase the preaching, and He will send more <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and women to expand the book distribution even more. Kṛṣṇa is the perfect reciprocator. He showers unlimited help and facilities upon us when He sees that we are using His gifts in a proper way.

sub=The Bhakta Program

Generally no one should go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> immediately after joining. Those who join the temple must undergo a period of purification and training in devotional life. When they are qualified as devotees and trained in the spiritual principles, then the temple president should consider sending them out on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party. The temple president should see that new devotees receive regular training in all areas of devotional life.

The <em>bhakta</em> program must train the devotees to follow the temple programs, to chant and hear, to study the basic philosophy, and to keep the temple clean, and, above all, to understand that the main mission of ISKCON is to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness by printing and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. If the <em>bhaktas</em> are continually pointed in that direction, they will learn the goals of the movement and the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda. This should be preached in the temple classes, in special <em>bhakta</em> classes, and in individual instruction. If the traveling preachers occasionally preach about the importance of book distribution, all the temple devotees will gradually learn to take up the mission themselves.

When new devotees first go out, they should distribute magazines and small books around the <em>harināma</em> party. We should not send untrained people out, because they will make mistakes. But let us say someone joins December 1st. What is he going to do? He should assist a big distributor. That is better than going on his own, because if he gets a bad taste on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, later on he will have trouble learning. It is better to learn the bliss without having to struggle.

sub=The Saṅkīrtana Leader

The primary duty of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader is to organize the <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Properly organized devotees will not waste time having two <em>saṅkīrtana</em> groups in the same place at once and will not burn places out by going to the same place too often. This is especially relevant on traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and may not be so important in the city.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader cares for the devotees' physical needs. They must be properly dressed, and they should eat ample and healthy <em>prasādam</em> that is served on time. When the devotees are properly prepared, he gives them enough books, tells them what to say and what not to say, and sends them to areas of the city or country where their abilities will be maximized. He makes sure the vehicles are properly taken care of —every car is kept clean, serviced regularly, and has working lights and sufficient rubber tread on the tires. And he keeps count of the money, so that the books can be paid for.

A good <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader invests time and energy in training new devotees. He tries his best to inspire them first to improve the quality of their distribution and then gradually their quantity. It is important that beginners get his personal association or the association of another advanced and older distributor. They should distribute right next to him and learn his techniques; although slightly artificial, it is better than doing only a few books a day. They will gradually improve and soon develop their own techniques. One should watch them and correct their mistakes. For example, if you see someone always looking down while distributing, you build up his self-confidence and tell him to look people in the face. But if someone does not improve after a month or so, you may understand that he cannot be helped and you can let him distribute what he can on his own. You practically have to be a psychiatrist in Kali-yuga.

Above all, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader should be surrendered to the order of his spiritual master and cooperate with the temple president. And then he will be a potent force in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

sub=Congregational Preaching

The purpose of sending devotees to open small temples is to attract new devotees, train them, and engage them in book distribution. That is the way Kṛṣṇa consciousness spreads everywhere. But sometimes a small preaching center does not have enough devotees to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Let us say there are only three devotees in the temple. They should go out chanting and attract new people and cultivate these people and make them into devotees. When there are six or seven devotees in the temple, then they can start distributing books.

A small temple is not an excuse to avoid <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. One can distribute books to the temple congregation and encourage them to distribute. Give them thirty, forty, or one hundred books. Although they distribute more slowly, it is a wonderful way to increase book distribution. One can also distribute books through temple shops, mail order departments, and ISKCON membership programs. Programs that include benefits such as sets of Prabhupāda's books are good sources of book distribution as well as income. Our Life Membership program has been popular amongst the Indians throughout the world, and it is a good way to get Śrīla Prabhupāda's books into their homes. As ISKCON expands its congregational preaching programs, memberships will be a good way to bring sets of books into the homes of the congregational members.

sub=Book Production

Our preaching effort begins with book production. First we make the books and then we distribute them. This is especially relevant in countries where not many books are available in the local languages. It is in the best interest of all temples to make sure the book production department is fully staffed to make as many books in the different languages as quickly as possible. The temple president should arrange for any qualified persons associated with the temple to help the BBT speed up the production. And when all Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are produced in all the local languages, the devotees can become learned in the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, remain fixed in their devotional service, and go on increasing the distribution.

sub=Bookkeeping

Every temple is responsible for paying the BBT immediately after books are received and sold. In some BBT areas, temples are responsible to pay within thirty to sixty days after receiving books. If a temple does not pay its bill on time, it acquires what is known as a bad debt, or a debt not covered by a stock of books. Temples must keep inventories, and then they can pay the BBT properly. When books are taken out of the warehouse, the number of books should be noted in a logbook, and then it should be ascertained later that the books are paid for by the distributors who took them.

One has to keep the book distribution results and papers properly, for they are the most important records in the temple treasury. All the income is made through <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Therefore the temple president should always know what is happening in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> department. A proper account of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> results should be done each week. On the basis of that accounting, the BBT must be paid each week or at least twice a month. For example, if a devotee has distributed one hundred <em>Bhagavad-gītās</em> and two hundred <em>Bhāgavatams</em>, the accountant should record that result and multiply the prices of the books times the number of books sold. He does this for all the book distributors and calculates the amount that has to be paid to the BBT that week.

Sometimes books get lost or damaged, or the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees give an improper account of the numbers of books they sold. That is why the inventory is important. One knows how many books were received from the BBT and how many were sold on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. The number of books in the warehouse should be the same number as the number of books received minus the number of books distributed. In fact, that is rarely the situation because of loss and damage or devotees not counting properly, so the temple has to periodically pay the BBT for the missing books. That is best done once a month; otherwise one falls too far behind.

No temple president can be said to be doing his job unless he pays his BBT bills regularly and on time. Not paying the BBT regularly is sufficient grounds for removal of a temple president, according to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Going into debt with the BBT is easy to do: simply don't pay the BBT for a few weeks, and then the temple is in debt. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita  said that three things must be extinguished immediately, otherwise they will destroy one—fire, debt, and disease. Debt is considered as dangerous as fire. Debts to the BBT can ruin a temple. The BBT is Śrīla Prabhupāda's heart, and the <em>lakṣmī</em> is his blood. When a temple is in debt to the BBT, it is sucking Prabhupāda's blood.

The temple president must carefully determine whether he has the money for the expenditures being made. If one does not have the money, he cannot spend it! This is a simple yet extremely important and often overlooked point, because, at least in the West, it is easy to get bank loans or credit cards and to manipulate financing and other things. This type of spending leads to carelessness. One can spend much more than he makes, if he is not careful, and soon he will find himself bankrupt. Debt greatly burdens the temple devotees. They lose spiritual enthusiasm if the temple is in debt, and the management has to push them to collect more. Devotees should be able to feel confident that the managers will prevent the temple from going into debt. When they see debts increasing, they lose faith in the management. Therefore the temple president should make it his first rule never to spend money that he does not have and go into debt for any reason. This will keep the temple financially strong and the devotees happy. Such devotees may not have many material things in the temple, but at least they will not have debts, so they can be spiritually satisfied.

sub=Distribution Zones

A regional management organization, of which all the different temple presidents are members, should come together and discuss issues such as distribution zones. It is not good for our reputation or for the spreading of Kṛṣṇa consciousness if devotees come into another temple's zone and neglect cultivating people properly. Local devotees become disturbed if distributors from other temples come into their zone and burn the place out. Therefore the regional body should make a resolution that nobody can go into another temple's zone without the permission of that zone's temple president. This is Śrīla Prabhupāda's principle, and he even said that they should give that temple a percentage of their collection. Another alternative is to make sure all the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees cultivate the people equally within their region by centralized management. That is the system we use in Germany. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees distribute wherever they like, and they feel like they have to cultivate all the people in the whole country.

sub=Legalizing Saṅkīrtana Spots

It is important for the temple president to get the distribution spots legalized. He may do this personally or through another devotee. By endeavoring through the legal system, sometimes more spots can be legalized through making the case that ISKCON does spiritual welfare work that benefits all the people in the country. A good lawyer can give advice as to whether this is feasible or not. If one is forced to accept what the local authorities give, and if that is not enough, then the devotees can travel from town to town and village to village so quickly that they don't disturb anyone. Thus one can continue distributing without problems.

sub=Traveling Saṅkīrtana

Both city <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> are good, and both expand the preaching. City <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is usually done where many <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spots are accessible by public transportation. But sometimes the temple is not in the city and one has to travel. To spread the mercy of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books not only in the crowded cities but also throughout the countryside, one gets in vans and travels from town to town, village to village. Traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> not only distributes the mercy widely, it also increases the distribution results. The only problem with traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is that one must maintain vans and rent hotel rooms, which is costly. Therefore, it may not always be possible to have traveling parties. But if it can be arranged, it is a wonderful way to spread the mercy far and wide.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees usually prefer traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, because it is easy to become entangled in different aspects of temple life, such as overly long temple programs that run on until nine o'clock or later. Thus the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have a hard time getting out the door before ten o'clock. But when they are traveling they finish their morning program early, and they get out on the street at the same time as the local people do.

Although traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is good, the temple president should make sure that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees don't become estranged from the temple. Sometimes a traveling party develops a separatist attitude and travels throughout the country independent of any temple. Therefore the temple president and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader should be on guard against that.

sub=Saṅkīrtana from the Temple

The secret to successful management is to organize the temple around preaching. Śrīla Prabhupāda stated in the early 1970's that preaching is the essence, and this is as relevant now as it was then. Without preaching there can be no ecstasy in spiritual life. Thus every temple president should organize the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books far and wide. Although he may have a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader, the president should be the super <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader and inspire all the devotees to distribute more and more.

If the temple president is intelligent, he arranges the temple program so that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are ready to go at eight-thirty or nine o'clock. That is possible if the devotees get to rest early and chant all their rounds in the morning. But one may have to accept that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees leave the temple later and perhaps return later. Then, instead of going to the evening temple program, they can read and take rest. It is best to restrict the <em>Bhāgavatam</em> class to one hour from the start of <em>Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava</em> to give all the devotees the best start on their morning activities. Similarly, the <em>Gītā</em> class should end by nine o'clock in the evening to allow everyone to take rest early. The temple president should humbly request the speakers to keep within these time limits, even visiting <em>sannyāsīs</em> or spiritual masters. Otherwise the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission will be disturbed.

The temple managers should engage <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> only. The book distributors should not be distracted by other activities. They should simply go out and distribute books, free of worries or fears about anything else. But if the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are asked to do some service in the temple, they should just do it quickly and then go out. Those supporting the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission also go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, so <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees also have to engage in support activities sometimes. They should not waste time arguing. They are generally asked to help because there are not enough devotees in the temple to do the basic things required. For example, someone has to cook, even when everybody is going on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. If everyone says, “I only go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, and I do nothing else," nobody will eat. Therefore some of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men may have to run in the kitchen and cook. Then, when everybody has eaten, they can all go out. The perfection of management is to get all the devotees, including the temple devotees, out the door.

For the temple devotees, we have instituted the once-a-week marathon. Everyone, including the temple president, goes out the door and distributes Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In that way, along with the Sunday Feast and the December Marathon, the temple is more of a preaching temple. Everyone should be attached to and feel the pressure of the preaching mission. That is very important. Therefore we should go on with once-a-week <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and the Prabhupāda Marathon and go out as much as possible. An even better program is everyone goes out one week a month, because that is seven days a month instead of four.

sub=Marathon Management Strategy

We have seen practically that a well-organized marathon is created before the marathon starts. A marathon that is organized during the marathon is a badly managed marathon. To organize a marathon means to create the parties properly, to inform all the devotees well in advance that there will be a marathon and that they are involved, to pick out the places where everyone will go, to give them vans in proper running order, to give them a stock of books and supplies and arrange to replenish them from various points, and to collect the scores and the <em>lakṣmī</em>. All these things must be organized before the marathon starts. Otherwise there will be confusion, and nothing is worse than confusion to make a marathon a real flop.

The most important item is getting everyone out. One keeps back only those few souls absolutely required to run the Deity services and preaches to them that their austerity is to work like five or ten devotees and thereby allow the others to go out. Now, devotees who are not usually on marathons sometimes feel shy or scared to go out. The thought of meeting people on the street sometimes scares them to death, and they would rather do anything else than go out. Of course, this is due to the ignorant condition of the mind alone, for when those devotees go out, eighty percent of the time they become completely ecstatic within a few days. But the manager has to make their conversion into <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees as painless as possible. So, he starts preparing the devotees at least a month in advance by dropping statements in class and elsewhere, like "Isn't it wonderful that the marathon will begin next month? Everyone will be going out, you know.” Also, one has to make a list that mentions exactly who is going out, and one has to post it clearly at least two weeks in advance for all to see.

Giving the devotees clear information about what is going to happen is the best way to keep devotees enthusiastic and satisfied. The worst thing is to spring something on devotees in the morning announcements and expect them all to surrender. This is the stupidest kind of management there is, and anyone who does that deserves the chaos that follows. Every devotee has plans for what he will do on a given day, and sometimes his plans were made weeks in advance. If the temple president says, “Now we are all going to do this today,” and gives no one a chance to explain why that is impossible, then he is a fool number one, without any respect for people. A clever manager will plan everything out a week in advance and post the activities of the next week (starting from Monday) on the bulletin board the previous Wednesday so that all devotees can plan accordingly how they will surrender.

A marathon is a perfect example of that. Warn them nicely, prepare them nicely, and help them to surrender. Sometimes make funny comments as if you were also a little worried about having to go out and face people on the street, and in this way they loosen up a bit. The more marathon information that is posted on the board as soon as it is ready, the better the marathon is. Suppose you are organizing a van or whatever that some non-marathon party is using beforehand for something else. The best thing is to have a meeting with all the parties and leaders involved three weeks before the marathon and work out all details as to members, vehicles, and supplies. This should be posted for all to see. The effect of this is that everyone gets the point: “The marathon is serious, the managers are already planning it, and I cannot escape.” Another point is that in case there is some objection to the plan, or some sharp soul sees some fault, it can be corrected before everyone goes out. Getting the battle plan perfect before going into battle is the best policy, because lives depend on it.  

Write down all the duties of those who stay back, create a temporary authority to run the minimal affairs left to run, create a backup for that temporary authority in case he falls into <em>māyā</em> alone in the temple, and teach them exactly what they have to do. Post this. Let everyone know who is in charge of what during the marathon and who they should go to and what they should expect from those persons and what they should not expect (such as a lot of money for anything). Order all required supplies far in advance. Have a supply in stock before departure and also have a mid-marathon refill if required. Have stocks of books, food, and supplies waiting at depots around the country and distribute like mad. If you organize everything like this, then there is absolutely no need for the temple managers to remain behind during a marathon. In fact, it is <em>māyā</em> if the temple managers remain behind. The temple managers should beat everyone else in the marathon, then everyone will understand their superior spiritual potency.

Prabhupāda said that the best manager is the best preacher. He who is the most potent devotee is best suited to leading others. He can never tolerate sitting around watching the walls as the others are out getting the bliss. It is simply a question of proper management before the marathon. If this is done, there are no problems. But there may be something from the <em>karmi</em> world that requires the manager to be reached by the temporary authorities. Therefore each manager should always be accessible by telephone or a beeper in emergencies. But the normal appointments should be put off until after the marathon. Usually there is little that cannot be put off to some other date by a phone call.

sub=Quotas

One should perform <em>saṅkīrtana</em> without fruitive desires. Sometimes the temple authorities think that by giving the devotees quotas, it will increase or maintain their level of distribution. But all results are up to Kṛṣṇa, and despite having a big quota, they will not be able to fulfill it without Kṛṣṇa's sanction. Therefore quotas are often counterproductive. They make the devotees fruitive. Devotees think they have to perform in a certain manner for their devotional service to be acceptable. I have heard statements like “Don't return to the temple if you don't do five hundred books this week.” That is not Kṛṣṇa conscious. One should distribute as much as he can and depend on Kṛṣṇa for the results. This is also a quota—to do as much as you can—but it is a natural quota that doesn't create any pain in the heart of the distributor or disappoint him at not reaching the goal. One should not think, “I must do so many books this week, otherwise I'm a failure.” One should simply think, “I'm Kṛṣṇa's eternal servant. In this lifetime my service is distributing as many of these wonderful books as I can. Let me fully depend on the Lord's mercy and pray to the lotus feet of my spiritual master that I can become completely attached to fulfilling his mission to distribute books.” Then he will gradually increase his distribution naturally and become happy automatically.

sub=Homogeneous Preaching

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Someone may accept that books are the basis but not that by just distributing books all the other services will develop automatically. After all, someone has to engage in the other services. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, someone has to do the other services, and we encourage all preaching. Still, if you distribute books, the facilities for all these other departments will come automatically. You just go on distributing, and as soon as you see an opportunity develop, jump on it, and use it to engage someone in preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness more. In this way the whole movement grows. We don't say “just distribute books” and suddenly the other departments spring out of nothing. We are not so foolish. But we do say that by your distribution efforts, all the facilities will gradually come. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes it's said that book distribution is a complete program in itself and doesn't need anything else. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> That's a fact. It's perfectly complete in itself. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Wouldn't we be satisfied by just distributing books and not having any temples?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If there were no temples, you wouldn't be distributing books for long. When you distribute books, people want to join, and temples give them a place to join. Temples are for the devotees who cannot distribute books, especially householders and their families. Besides, they want to maintain temples. Śrīla Prabhupāda personally started the restaurant program for householders. All kinds of programs are needed in ISKCON. We don't say, “Just distribute books and forget everything else." But distributing books is the main program. As long as book distribution is going on, the other programs are safe and secure. They expand the book distribution even more. Every time someone opens a restaurant or a preaching center, more people are attracted who will also go out and distribute books. It is all working together as one homogeneous preaching program.

sub=Book Distribution and Mayapur

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How much is the BBT involved in the Mayapur Project? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The BBT doesn't manage anything in Mayapur anymore. A percentage of the BBT turnover, which right now is around twenty-five percent, is sent to the Mayapur Project Development Fund. All of this money is spent on the Mayapur Project, which includes the temple construction, the master plan development, and the buildings essential for the further development of Mayapur. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Should the devotees meditate on this project, or should they simply concentrate on book distribution?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> They should concentrate on book distribution with their hearts and souls, but they should also understand that one quarter of the value of every book distributed goes directly to the Mayapur Project. Śrīla Prabhupāda said, "First comes Vṛndāvana, then Bombay, and then Mayapur.” He wanted us to fulfill this mission of the <em>ācāryas</em>. He said that if we develop Mayapur, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura will come from the spiritual world and carry us back home to Godhead. Śrīla Prabhupāda considered the Mayapur Project so important that, in March 1977, just before he left the planet, he wanted us to start building the temple immediately, although we had no plan. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How can we increase book distribution around the world? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> I see it as a question of consciousness and support from the higher members of ISKCON. The most influential people in each zone, like the GBC men, should dedicate their lives to preaching about book distribution and the Mayapur Project. In this way they can inspire the devotees to expand their book distribution. The spiritual masters in ISKCON are presently an untapped source of inspiration. All the spiritual masters in ISKCON, whether they are GBC men, <em>sannyāsīs</em>, temple presidents, or just preachers, should give to their disciples Śrīla Prabhupāda's mission to produce books in all the languages of the world and distribute the books profusely throughout the world. The BBT could increase its remittances to Mayapur, and we could build Mayapur City more quickly, because the greatest problem we face is the lack of funds.

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted the Mayapur Temple to be financed by book distribution, and he said that we could do it by doubling every year. If the BBT were running at the normal pace right now without doubling, we could build it in fifteen years. If we doubled, we could do it in eight years. And if we doubled again, we could do it in four years. If we all saw the economic benefits, we could keep on increasing the book distribution, and benefit the BBT at the same time.

The main thing is the preaching work that should be done by the GBC men, the <em>gurus</em> to their disciples, the <em>śikṣā-gurus</em> to their followers, the <em>sannyāsīs</em> to those they influence, the temple presidents to the people in their temples, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leaders to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. Everyone should be encouraged to dedicate his life to the book distribution mission, so that we can accomplish all the goals Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted accomplished in our lifetime.

We can get the credit. Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> to Arjuna, <em>mayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam eva nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin</em>: “This battle is already won. All the men are already dead. All you have to do is become an instrument in this fight, and if you are My instrument, you will accomplish the required goals.” He called him <em>savya-sācin</em>, expert at shooting arrows. Kṛṣṇa appointed Arjuna, who had the propensity to accomplish His mission, and told him, “It's already accomplished. Just become the instrument of My will and become a success.” Similarly, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all the <em>ācāryas</em>, including Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and especially Śrīla Prabhupāda, have given us this project to develop and have desired that book distribution around the world keep doubling. Thus it is already accomplished. We just have to do it and take the credit.

title=The Qualities of a Saṅkīrtana Devotee

sub=A Well-rounded Person

It is difficult for me to say what the most important quality is for a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee to possess, because no one quality is more important than another. A <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee must be a well-rounded person. For example, he must tolerate all kinds of changing conditions: Sometimes it is cold and sometimes it is hot, sometimes people are friendly and sometimes they are nasty, and sometimes he is living in the back of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van and sometimes in some grungy hotel. He is so tolerant because he sees how the people are suffering, and he wants to help them. Thus he is also merciful and kind. Despite disturbing obstacles, he stays out on the street and continues to give Śrīla Prabhupāda's books to the people. To go on like this for a lifetime requires determination, especially if he doesn't do so well. Sometimes a devotee does well in the beginning but later has difficulty accomplishing the same results, and he has to show his determination to please Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master.

He must be dedicated and devoted to the spiritual master because he is distributing books on the spiritual master's order. That order comes from Śrīla Prabhupāda, the Founder-Acārya of our ISKCON society. Prabhupāda has given that order throughout the history of ISKCON, and it applies for all history to come. Therefore the disciple must have a very great love for the spiritual master and his order. He accepts the order of the spiritual master and fulfills that order with his heart and soul. Śrīla Prabhupāda often quoted Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravarti Ṭhākura's commentary on the verse <em>vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana</em>, which says that the disciple must make the desire of the spiritual master his desire. The spiritual master desires to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness and distribute as many books as possible throughout the world, and we have to make this desire our desire because we have so many desires that do not have much to do with the preaching mission. This is natural for the conditioned soul. Therefore a serious devotee engages in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and becomes very happy.

A <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee must be nonenvious because now and then others will defeat him in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> competition. When this happens, he should be pleased that the other devotees are doing so nicely in their devotional service, and he should aspire to follow in their footsteps. He should not think, "I should have done what they did. I'm also very great. Why is everyone applauding them?” This is envy manifesting. Thus a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee must be satisfied with whatever comes of its own accord. For example, <em>prasādam</em> in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van is not very opulent. One cooks on a one-burner stove with a pressure cooker, making <em>kicharī</em> with breadsticks in different varieties, sometimes with more potatoes, sometimes with fewer potatoes. One has to be satisfied with this simple meal.

Thus austerity is required. To always carry around a lot of books is a much harder austerity than to meditate in the forest and perform mystic <em>yoga</em>. The austerity of the <em>yogīs</em> is to sit in a freezing cold river on a freezing cold winter's day and simply experience the coldness. This is a great austerity, and we doubt that we could do it. But we also doubt that the <em>yogīs</em> could stand on a modern city street with a pile of books on their arm, handing them out to the people who come by. Now, of the two forms of austerity, which is more important and relevant to the preaching mission? The <em>yogī</em>, following the path of mystic austerity —sitting alone in the forest and enjoying the fruits of his austerities—may benefit himself, but he is not benefiting anyone else. On the other hand, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is one-hundred-percent dedicated to serving and helping other people, which makes his austerity much more important and valuable than the austerity a mystic <em>yogi</em> performs.

One could list so many other qualities that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and ladies possess. Still, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are sometimes criticized by foolish persons who think that something is wrong with single-mindedly doing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> all the time, that one doesn't become learned or devotionally qualified. That is foolish, because you will find all the best qualities in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. To keep the van clean is a cleaning project like cleaning the temple. Cooking little feasts on their one-burner is also an art. They are serving the Vaiṣṇavas. And they have learned the most important art of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious and distributing that Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others. What more do you want? Everything is there. Therefore to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is the most glorious position within this Kṛṣṇa consciousness mission.

sub=Beaming with Transcendental Consciousness

One who knows <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> and distributes it to others is the most magnanimous of souls because he is distributing the glorious words of Śrīla Vyāsadeva, who presented this transcendental knowledge under the order of Śrī Nārada Muni. And now Śrīla Prabhupāda is bringing this knowledge under the order of the previous <em>ācāryas</em> to all the conditioned souls within this world. These books with their transcendental purports are designed to awaken realization of the Absolute Truth within the hearts of the conditioned souls. Therefore the devotees wander from town to town and village to village just to deliver this transcendental knowledge.

Through these transcendental books the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will ultimately conquer all other philosophies and forms of religiosity on this planet. Who else has knowledge that can compare to the knowledge in these books? The Bible, for instance, gives some knowledge of the Supreme, but it is a short book, containing mainly analogies, allegories, stories, and histories. It contains very little information of the qualities, activities, and pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

To know about Kṛṣṇa you have to go to authorities like Nārada Muni and Aṅgirā Ṛṣi, and they will grant you this knowledge. That is why we distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Here we have an authority granting us transcendental knowledge. They are not just any books. It is not that we like to sell books. If I gave you a set of encyclopedias to sell, you probably wouldn't be able to do it, because you are not interested in them. Even though you might make some money by selling them, you know that such books are available everywhere, they have no value, and you become a fool and a rascal by reading them, not a learned scholar. Therefore we are only interested in distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. His books have the potency to incite a revolution in the hearts of men. A sudden change in fortune is within their grasp. They have the possibility to awaken to their real position as servants of the Lord and become blissful. This is not possible by distributing any other kind of book. Śrīla Prabhupāda wants us to distribute these books because he knows the people have no other source of transcendental knowledge. If they want it, they have to get it from us.

The problem is they don't even want it, so we follow in the footsteps of the saintly personalities and try to inspire the conditioned souls to want something they don't want. It is amazing that you can give a book to a person who doesn't want it. The mundane salesmen can study our technique all day and night, and they will not be able to duplicate it. Many times a day, every day of the year, week after week, thousands of books are given to people who don't want them, because when a person beaming with transcendental consciousness is standing before them, they become attracted and impressed. The devotee is unlike the ordinary people of this world. He is not asking much: “Just take one, two, or twenty of these books home.” After all, people buy so much garbage while they are shopping. Half of the time they don't know what they are buying. But when they take home these books, they become transcendentally blissful. The distributors often send us photos of people who have bought sets of books, blissfully holding the books with big smiles on their faces.

During the Prabhupāda Marathon, every one of us can give others the opportunity to experience that happiness. It is nice that the Christians have this Christmas holiday. The people are a little loose with their <em>lakṣmī</em>, and when they meet a devotee they become enlivened. A devotee approaches them with confidence because he knows he has something they really want. Superficially they may not want it, but deep down they do because they want to be happy, and this is the way to be happy. Therefore they surrender and take the book home. And when they read the books, their whole life changes. They write us letters, saying, “I've read all these books, and now I can no longer live within the material world. What shall I do?" We say, “Wonderful!" Another book has bombed this person's material life to smithereens. Another bomb has blasted the material existence of another materialist into tiny pieces, and now he has become a spiritualist.

sub=Material Qualifications Are Not Enough

Those on the middle-class platform, <em>madhya</em>ma-adhikārī, can engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement because <em>saṅkīrtana</em> means preaching to the innocent. Those on the third-class platform, <em>kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</em>, cannot engage in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> because they lack the faith to do it. You have to have faith to engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. It cannot be done by material means alone. Even if you were an expert distributor of encyclopedias before you came to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you wouldn't be able to distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books on that basis alone. We once hired an expert book salesman to sell our books in the bookstores. “No problem," he said. “I can easily sell these books. They are very nice.” But he couldn't sell a single book. He had to come back shamefaced and admit, “I cannot sell these books. Nobody wants them. How do you do it?" Our devotees do it by having faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Even new <em>bhaktas</em> can distribute hundreds of books a week and leave the greatest salesmen in the dust. Not many people would believe how many books we sell each week, and we don't even tell them, because they would just get bewildered.

The fallen conditioned souls are blessed by this wonderful book distribution mission even though they are averse to Kṛṣṇa.

quote=icchā-dveṣa-samutthena<br />&emsp;dvandva-mohena bhārata<br />sarva-bhūtāni sammohaṁ<br />&emsp;sarge yānti paran-tapa

It is heavy to think about, but we are approaching haters of Kṛṣṇa, who don't want to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The devotee has to convince them that something is wrong with being a hater of Kṛṣṇa. If he nicely explains to them why they want these books, then the people become attracted to the devotee and the beauty of the books, and they take books without even realizing that this is exactly what they didn't want. Later on many of them realize this and ask themselves, "Why did I buy these books? I didn't even want them,” and when they meet the distributor on the street again, they tell him, “I didn't want these books, but somehow you made me buy them.” They bought them because their deepest, most heartfelt desire is to take many books and surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. People surrender to the book distributors because a pure representative of the spiritual master is standing in front of them. They can see that he is more powerful, he has his mission, and his concentration is fixed on one point. Never underestimate the purity and determination needed by the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

sub=Only Devotees Can Sell These Books

No materialist can distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. A true story from Argentina illustrates this point. In 1976, a military coup overthrew Mrs. Perón's government and took control of Argentina. They tried to destroy the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement because the Catholic Church was actually running the whole thing from behind the scenes, saying, “Get rid of these Hare Kṛṣṇas; they're too powerful.” Paramilitary forces fired machine gun bullets through the front of the temple as the devotees were paying obeisances before taking <em>prasādam</em>. They confiscated everything—books, pictures, and everyone's <em>japa</em> beads. The devotees had to flee with the Deities to Brazil. It was a terrible situation.

I was always trying to think of a way to get back the books the military government had stolen. For many years the books sat in a military warehouse. Then, in 1984, when the military government was deposed and a civilian government was elected into power, they opened the military warehouses and auctioned off the confiscated goods, and one professional bidder bought all our books with the intention of reselling them for a profit. The devotees were not aware of this and were convinced that our books had been burned long ago. Every time I asked them, they said, “There's no way they'd keep books for ten years; the books must be already long gone."

Two years later, the bidder happened to run into one of our book distributors on the street. When the man saw the <em>Bhagavad-gīt</em>ā, he said, “Oh, I also have many books with this funny writing. Would you be interested in them?” The devotee, being new and unaware of the situation, wondered what this man was talking about, so he went back to the temple and told Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami about it. As we know, Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami is really smart, so he went to the man and nonchalantly said, “Oh, I've heard you have something we might be interested in. Let's see what you have.” The man showed him <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavata</em>m, and Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami said, “Nobody cares about these books, and certainly nobody will buy them."

The man said, “Yeah, I know. I've been trying for two years to sell these books and nobody wants them. I haven't sold a single book in two years."

“Yes, nobody wants these books. What do you want me to do?”

"Can you use these books?” “Oh, maybe, I don't know.” "Please, take them."

For an insanely low price, Bhaktibhūṣaṇa Swami took back the books, and the devotees sold them in less than two weeks. The funny thing was, because the devotees' money had also been confiscated by the military, they never had to pay the bill for the printing. After ten years, they got the books back for almost nothing because this man couldn't sell one book. From this example we can understand that our books don't want to be sold by materialists. The books stay in their hands and say, “No, we won't go anywhere. There's no love and devotion here.” The distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is a completely spiritual activity that can only be done by devotees.

sub=Saṅkīrtana Identification

Sometimes the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are criticized for strongly identifying with their service. But I think this identification is good because it is so easy to stop being a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee and become a <em>gurukula</em> devotee, a kitchen devotee, a <em>pūjā</em> devotee, a farm devotee, or whatever, because these activities don't demand as much surrender and are not as taxing as going out, walking the streets, and meeting contaminated, inimical, and demoniac people on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> every day.

To come back to the temple and do some other service doesn't mean everything is going to be blissful, because the mind goes with you. The mind becomes agitated in the temple because there is less pure protection in the temple than in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> field. There are all kinds of agitations: somebody tries to push his opinion on you, to show you he is better than you, or to force you to do something you don't want to do. It is just plain old <em>māyā</em>. There are a lot of troubles in the temple; everything is not all peaches and cream. It is much better out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, where you will find the real protection, the real bliss, and the juice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

To identify yourself as a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is a lot better than to identify yourself as a <em>gṛhastha</em> or a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or a this or a that. We are all <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees in Lord Caitanya's eternal <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party, so there can be no fault with this identification. But, of course, if you become proud and think other devotees are something else, more lowly, then you fall down from the platform of purification and become contaminated. Proud devotees usually fall away from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and cannot do it for a long time.

But one who knows, “I'm a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, and I had better stay a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee," and who therefore prays, “Kṛṣṇa, please give me Your mercy so I can remain a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, and all you devotees, please bless me so that I can perform this service all my life”—then it is a good identification, because that makes one humble.

Being a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee means being a servant of all the people. It doesn't mean you are something great, glorious, and wonderful. Of course, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are glorified on the weekends. Someone will get all the roars and “rahhhs" from all the devotees. “Rahhh! You're the greatest! You're number one! Pound the drums! Pound the floor! This guy's the greatest!” Of course, five minutes later everyone forgets it. But, at the time, one is thinking himself the greatest. That is an identification which also destroys everything. You are not the greatest, you are not the smallest. You are just Kṛṣṇa's humble servant. You are supposed to go out and distribute the books and not get hung up on all these things. In a humble state of mind one can perform <em>saṅkīrtana</em> continuously. But as far as the identification itself, it is good to identify yourself as a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. It is better than any other identification. But ultimately we know we are just Kṛṣṇa's servants. We are nothing but the servants of the servants of the servants of the <em>gopīs</em>. Lord Caitanya taught us this, and He is the supreme <em>saṅkīrtana-ācārya</em>. So we should follow in His footsteps.

Anybody with a sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in his heart will glorify the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees, but it is the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees' responsibility to understand that all this glorification is for their service, not for them. If somebody says, "Oh, you're doing so wonderfully,” it is because you are doing a wonderful service. The service is glorious, and you just happen to be doing it. Therefore you are being glorified. Somebody else will do it if you don't, and then he will be glorified. These books are so wonderful that anything connected with them-reading them, distributing them, producing them—makes one glorious. It is the books' credit, not one's own credit.

sub=Transcendental Knowledge

In South Africa in 1975, we were in Śrīla Prabhupāda's room and he had just been given the Fifth Canto of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>. He was very happy to get this book. But as he was looking at the book, and as everybody left, he said, “In America they are thinking these books are for others, that they are simply for distribution. They don't know that I have written these books for my disciples to read. Now I am authorizing you to read my books twenty-four hours a day. I want all my disciples to become expert in this philosophy and then distribute it with great power and potency.”

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted his disciples to distribute millions of books, but he wanted them to do it for their whole lives, not like a comet streaking through the air—running around without really understanding what is going on. One cannot distribute books thinking of big results alone. One can do that for some time. We have personally seen that the motive to be on top of the charts is inspiring, but it doesn't last. One must have transcendental knowledge, <em>vidyā</em>. If it is done for fruitive results, the results will gradually diminish. Or we may maintain big results, but our idea will be, "I can also get big results in the material world. Why do I need Kṛṣṇa consciousness?” Therefore we have been losing some devotees throughout the years. Prabhupāda told us not to be attached to mundane fame, profit, or distinction. What difference does it make if nobody knows what you do, or nobody cares? The spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa know. We may somehow or other distribute by a material arrangement, but that will ultimately go down, down, down, and we will lose so many men. In 1970, when there were 450 devotees in this movement, Prabhupāda announced that we now had enough men and we should teach them to become first-class Vaiṣṇavas. “First class" means

quote=titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ<br />&emsp;suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām<br />ajāta-śatravaḥ śāntāḥ<br />&emsp;sādhavaḥ sādhu-bhūṣaṇāḥ

"The symptoms of a devotee are that he is tolerant, merciful, and friendly to all. He is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime.”

sub=Absolute Determination

Our mission is to simply distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And the best way to do that we already know. We produce and distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books by the millions and billions and trillions, by the tons and billions of tons, until every house has a set and a reserve set. This is our mission. Plenty of people can buy a set, a spare set, and a reserve set for the future time capsule. We should be so fanatical. It is required. And that is renunciation.

Distributing books is the supreme renunciation. One doesn't sit in a nice temple, but one mainly lives in a van, sleeping and eating there too. It is a greater renunciation than a mystic <em>yogi</em> performs in the Himalayas because on the street <em>māyā</em> stares you in the eyes and says, “What, are you crazy?" And the devotee has to stare back at <em>māyā</em> and say, “No! Who's crazy—the one thinking he's the body or the one knowing he's a spirit soul?"

Upon accepting this mission of the Lord, one immediately and automatically renounces all other desires. Simply by being engaged in distributing books or supporting the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, there is no question of maintaining material desires. Who could avoid becoming renounced when engaged in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission? Only the greatest rascal insists on trying to be the enjoyer. Although he is thrown into an ocean of nectar, he crawls out again because he has a hog mentality and doesn't like nectar.

Until one has developed a taste, to simply be in the nectar of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is very difficult. But even if you don't have the taste, the qualification for developing it is to just keep on going. Better yet is to have some brain in the head and understand that in Kali-yuga, <em>yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</em>, Lord Caitanya's <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is the way to worship Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then you will engage in this mission with full, absolute determination.

sub=Devotees Are Kind

Although the materialists are far removed from Kṛṣṇa, they can be brought closer to Him by the kindness of a devotee. Devotees are so kind that they go out in the cold weather and distribute Kṛṣṇa conscious books. The people may not want any books, but they are able to take them, because the devotee's compassionate desire is stronger than their desire. Then, when they take a book and associate with this literature, they are purified and gradually realize more and more about Kṛṣṇa, and they eventually go back home, back to Godhead. If all you kind devotees keep bringing the Lord's mercy to the conditioned souls, everybody in the universe will be satisfied, including the demigods. The demigods are also devotees, and they like to see Lord Caitanya's followers bringing Kṛṣṇa consciousness to every door. If you just go on preaching, then you will realize Kṛṣṇa one day. Kṛṣṇa will simply say, “I am like this," and your life will be perfect.

sub=The Flame of Compassion

A person too much absorbed in himself loses his compassion for others. He doesn't consider book distribution to be very important, or he thinks, “Let others do it.” Such a person will only engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission out of force. You have to put a sword to his back and say, “March!” and then maybe he will do something out of fear. To do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, one has to be devoid of self-interest and only interested in helping others.

In spiritual life, as soon as you discipline yourself and do something you don't want to do, you will immediately like it. Sometimes I see so much fear of going out on book distribution among the ladies. This is mental-platform nonsense. As soon as you do it you will feel fine. As soon as you dive in and splash around in the nectar ocean of Lord Nityānanda's mercy, you will find that you feel good about it. You begin to wake up, you are enlivened, and your vision becomes clear. But for this to be possible, one has to have at least a little flame of compassion for the fallen conditioned souls suffering in this material world. Even if this flame is small, by fanning it, it will gradually grow into a big flame. And when that fire of desire is always burning hotter to serve this mission of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda under the instruction of the spiritual master, it will make a wonderful effect.

If you want to help others, then distribute books. And if you have no compassion to help others, then do it to help yourself get some compassion, because you cannot be a devotee of the Lord without compassion.

sub=The Dog of a Vaiṣṇava

A devotee sees himself as the dog of a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore we wear these beads around our necks. They are our dog collar. They show that we're ready to give the Vaiṣṇava whatever he wants. We're ready to surrender to his every desire and perform whatever service he asks. And sometimes his request is big, as is Śrīla Prabhupāda's request that we spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world by distributing his books far and wide. This is a very big service. The world is big and there are only a few of us. But, by distributing these books, we are expanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness more effectively than we ever could by speaking to people at their doors. We are expanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness in towns and villages where we would not have been accepted in other ways. People accept books because books look innocent.

sub=The Meaning of Surrender

We have to increase more and more. Every devotee can do it. One who presently sells five hundred books a week can easily increase to eight hundred. But increase doesn't mean pushing more or being more materially intelligent; it means to completely surrender to Kṛṣṇa, holding on to the lotus feet of the Lord at every moment and remembering that if we don't surrender now, we may not be able to do it in the future. Therefore we should immediately surrender all desires and aspirations for anything other than book distribution. Increase doesn't only mean pushing more or being more materially intelligent, don't misunderstand; it means being increasingly conscious of Kṛṣṇa at every moment, completely connected with the energy of the Lord. Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna, <em>nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin</em>: “Don't worry. By following My instructions, you will become connected with Me as an instrument to annihilate all these men.”

We have seen that those not surrendering to the book distribution mission fall away, whereas those who surrender become stronger. This is proof—<em>phalena paricīyate</em>, judging the relative value by the results—that we must become completely convinced that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that sense gratification is only worthy of hogs and dogs. All sense gratification culminates in sex life. According to the degree one is attracted to sex life, one cannot hold on to the lotus feet of the Lord.

It is a question of our desire to become Kṛṣṇa conscious; when we understand the urgency of becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything else becomes insignificant. As soon as we become Kṛṣṇa conscious and surrender to the order of the Lord, He gives us the potency: <em>kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana</em>. “By Kṛṣṇa's <em>śakti</em>, the energy of the Lord, one can spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world.” It cannot be done by mundane abilities, by a big show, or by tricks; it can only be done by sincere, one-hundred-percent surrender. Surrender means surrender unto the instruction of the guru, and Śrīla Prabhupāda has ordered book distribution to double this year.

As the material world goes to hell and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement takes hold, we will be the only shelter for the conditioned souls, and the whole world will surrender. Those who have tried to stop us will look back and appreciate the glories of the devotees who kept on distributing books despite all attempts to prevent them. Therefore the most glorious devotees surrender one hundred percent to selling Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. The more one increases, the more the mercy of the spiritual master comes pouring down on one's head. You don't have to believe me—just try it and see. Surrender completely to Kṛṣṇa! Otherwise you can surrender completely to <em>māyā</em>. We are perfectly capable of complete surrender, so why not surrender to Kṛṣṇa and become completely ecstatic? Just give up all dog-eating desires!

sub=Consistency

One should be consistent and not go up and down on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> chart. Many <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have performed their service steadily for many years and are always around the same number on the chart. When the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> results are read in the assembly of devotees, everyone doesn't jump up and down and scream their glories. But they are not concerned, because they know how much Śrīla Prabhupāda appreciates their consistent service. Consistency (maintenance of one's position) is a symptom of the mode of goodness, going up (creation) is a symptom of the mode of passion, and falling down (destruction) is a symptom of the mode of ignorance. That doesn't mean if you get a house and maintain a family for the rest of your life, you are in the mode of goodness. No, we are talking about devotees cent percent dedicated to the devotional service of preaching. They become consistent, remain consistent, and go on to make wonderful results because there is no passion. And the proof is they maintain their position week after week.

Sometimes we get a new rising star on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, who lasts for one year and then burns out. Preaching and book distribution are not a one-year's or even a ten-years' work. They are your life's work. Therefore you should deal with yourself and your environment in such a way that you maintain a consistent position and steadily increase. When you make such a plan, you can understand that you are cent percent heading back to Kṛṣṇaloka.

sub=Book Distribution Is Nobody's Nature

Book distribution, especially when it is done on the pure platform, has nothing to do with the material qualities of <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em>. It is a transcendental activity. If it has any relation, it relates to the brahminical category. It is irrelevant to say, "It's not my material nature to distribute books,” because it is nobody's material nature to distribute Prabhupāda's books. Who was a book salesman before he joined Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Nobody. But if you go out and distribute books, then it is so pleasing to Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and all the great <em>ācāryas</em> that by their mercy you are spiritually lifted to a high level of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now, if you don't feel connected or satisfied with book distribution, then you haven't surrendered to it, because when you surrender you automatically become blissful.

sub=Doubters Have No Potency

The mind of an intelligent person, following in the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is only attracted by His mission. In other words, only those attracted and dedicated to the lotus feet of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa can be absorbed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement of Lord Caitanya. If one has inclinations toward Māyāvāda philosophy or doubts that Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya are the Supreme Personality of Godhead or that the mission of Gaura-Nitāi is the supreme mission, he will not have the transcendental potency to perform this wonderful <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

Your influence on this world is determined by your absorption in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, you cannot affect others. If you are thinking that this activity is materialistic, unimportant, or only for others, or that you will do it for some time but ultimately quit, then you cannot distribute. You must be fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and determined to distribute it. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a temporary manifestation; it is the eternal occupational duty of the soul.

There is no use trying to sit back and enjoy protection within this spiritual movement, wasting life in a lazy way. It is not sufficient to free oneself from material contamination. One has to positively place himself in spiritual service and activity. This spiritual service of transcendental distribution is so important that it is unending. There will always be someone to give books to. Only a fool thinks that everyone already has a book.

It is false to think that what you are doing is not relevant to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. If you are serving in the temple, that is relevant also, because you are supporting book distribution. It is like a house. You may not consider the foundation important, because you cannot see it under the earth, but without a foundation, the building will fall down. All parts of this ISKCON house are important, but some parts are more visible. The book distributors belong to the visible part. They are the representatives of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Thus their personal qualities and characteristics are so important. There is a big difference between receiving literature from a convinced distributor and an uncertain distributor. People get a good and powerful impression from a distributor who is convinced, and they read the book; but people are not inclined to read a book they were sold by material means from an uncertain distributor.

A neophyte distributor may take shelter of methods that are not so Kṛṣṇa conscious. That may be useful in the beginning so that he is able to distribute some books; but ultimately, he should work to develop and improve his consciousness. Although we are one big ISKCON team, we have to develop individually to make the team stronger. We develop by knowledge, a good standard of regulated life, and good association. Above all, we develop by hearing. Hear the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em>, and hear <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, the <em>Bhagavad-gīt</em>ā, and the other books of Śrīla Prabhupāda's! Don't become lazy and decide to stop hearing. Hear! Chant! Remember! Learn our philosophy! Learn good qualities! Then your personal character will develop, and the deep austerity performed on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> will bring out your transcendental knowledge and realizations. Then when you meet people, they will be very happy they met you.

Book distribution is not limited by material conceptions. It is the only preaching that makes a deep and lasting impression on all the people. Therefore we want to flood the world with these books. All other kinds of preaching to attract people to join Kṛṣṇa consciousness and help them perform devotional service are supplementary and complementary to book distribution. Book distribution is the most important service within the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Never for a moment doubt it! Never think other things are more important!

sub=To Stop Distributing Is Spiritual Death

Marathon prevents us from becoming monkeys engaged in activities for material benefit, <em>grāmya-karma</em>. Now that the marathon is going on, we are working hard and losing our attachment to the material body. This purifying atmosphere has to be kept up, even if it is difficult. First, we are not going to let you stop; we will keep kicking you out the door. And second, it is not good for you to stop. Therefore we are going to continue this marathon until it becomes our way of life. When you breathe, think, talk, and act for the sake of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, then you are living.

One cannot just send out a few book distributors in an attempt to avoid surrendering, because the power of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission comes from everyone's cumulative strength. When everyone has the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spirit and stands behind the mission, everyone is a source of power, or śakti, for the book distributors, but when a place is pervaded with a non-<em>saṅkīrtana</em> mood, everyone sucks away the <em>śakti</em> from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

I can implant some desire within you, but the desire that takes off and does wonders comes from you. I can set up a perfect arena for your desire to burn. I set up the bricks, the sand, the salt on the bricks, the necessary <em>yantras</em>, and the fruit around the fire <em>yajña</em>. I put the camphor here and the sticks there. Śrīla Prabhupāda lights the fire, and I pour on some ghee. But you have to pour on more ghee and add more wood. You keep the fire burning. If you don't keep it burning, then what hope is there? If we don't create some strong men and women with a burning desire to please the spiritual master and do something wonderful, then there is no hope. You have to turn around and start accomplishing things for the spiritual master. He should not have to work all the time just to get you to do something. It is about time to accept some responsibility. Each one of us has to take the responsibility to distribute these books. It is a mission! You should not just do it because you are told to do it. The hot flame of desire burning within your heart should impel you to do it. You cannot imagine how blissful and how strong you will become.

How can we increase our desire? Rise early in the morning, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and follow the four regulative principles. These things are important. But deep in your heart you have to realize that unless you stand on your own two feet, you are not going to succeed. At one point you have to grow up and take responsibility. This mission—book publication and distribution—is your mission. Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “It's your movement,” and I am saying the same thing, "It's your mission.” You just have to realize it. Prabhupāda used to say, “I'm an old man. I can die at any moment," and I say, “I'm not so old, but I also can die at any moment." And then what? There is no use having a movement where everyone leans on someone else, because as soon as that someone steps away, everything falls apart. You have to realize that this is your mission. Think about this. Meditate on it. Take that mission and run with it. We want convinced devotees who can preach, save others, and go back to Godhead themselves, not dead bodies propped up with a stick from behind, who fall apart or disappear when it comes time to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

When we are all engaging in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, strong people will be attracted to join our movement— people we don't have to hold up with a stick. Therefore we should use this marathon time as an opportunity to take up that mission if we haven't already done so, to renew that mission if we have given it up, and to keep on going if we have already committed our lives to it. Just don't stop!

My most dear Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava and Sakhīs, and Śrīla Prabhupāda,<br />&emsp;Please accept my most humble obeisances prostrated in the dust of Your lotus feet. All glories to You who are the Lords of the world!

Please accept this report and kindly be merciful upon the devotees of the North European Saṅkīrtana Zone. Your devotees distribute Your transcendental books throughout the year, except for the Mayapur Festival time. Generally distribution starts off humbly in January as the people readjust themselves after the Christmas season and the devotees recover from their efforts during the Prabhupāda Marathon. The normal <em>saṅkīrtana</em> day includes two hours of reading from Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, a class, and six to eight hours of distribution. During the colder seasons the traveling saṅkīrtaners stay overnight in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> flats or hotels, and during the warmer seasons they stay in their vans at night. About one-third of the devotees in the zone directly engage full time in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, while the remaining devotees support the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission through preaching programs in and around the temple.

There are five marathons throughout the year. The first is a Gaura-pūrnimā marathon that lasts for two weeks. The second is another two-week marathon for Nṛsiṁha-caturdaśī. For Janmāṣṭamī/Vyāsa-pūjā there is a three-week marathon, and in October there is a three-week marathon for all the ISKCON <em>gurus</em>. During these marathons, the number of devotees going out may or may not increase, but almost everyone in the zone participates in the Prabhupāda Marathon (formerly called the Christmas Marathon) for the last five weeks of the year. During this most intense <em>saṅkīrtana</em> experience, the programs are shorter and the mood is to increase distribution more and more. The devotees distribute ten to thirteen hours a day and think of distribution even while eating and dreaming.

The mercy of Your Lordships is readily apparent during marathon times. People who would ordinarily never buy a book take one or more. They often dance down the street with the books in their hand, and some even advertise the glories of the books to others, saying, “Look at these books! I have just met a most wonderful person selling them. You too should buy a book."

The standard distribution price is twice the BBT price. These books are valuable and not given out cheaply, because people respect books purchased for the right price. The emphasis in the zone is on mahā-big and big books, for all the devotees are eager to support the BBT's program to translate and publish books in over twenty different languages* and fund the Mayapur Project. Every devotee is fully aware that the BBT sends twenty-five percent of the price of each book to support this most important project of Śrīla Prabhupāda's in Mayapur. It inspires the devotees to distribute more and more books.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men avoid cheating methods. They don't change people up or allure them with stories of starving children. They sell the books on their merit and present the philosophy as it is. This straightforward preaching strengthens the devotees and protects them from the attacks of the demons, who always want to stop book distribution at all costs.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is <em>ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam</em>. For example, Switzerland has a population of only about six million people. In that mountainous land, the small number of regular <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees (approximately eight to fifteen full-timers) have distributed more than two million mahā-big and big books during the last twelve active <em>saṅkīrtana</em> years, and the devotees are confident that they will increase in the future. The more books people get, the more their desire increases to get more. Many positive effects have come from street distribution, and the set distribution program has been steadily increasing. Besides full-set sales, many people buy eight to ten books right on the street, and this enables the distributors to have such high daily scores. Many new <em>bhaktas</em> have joined directly from the street distribution. Our goal is to distribute many millions of books and thus force the demoniac society to change its sinful ways and surrender unto Your lotus feet. Rohiṇīsuta Prabhu once complained to me that every person he approached one day in Zurich already had books, and it was hard to distribute. It is a problem in such a small land.

One of the most inspiring things for the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees is that the temple presidents personally go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> during the marathons. Without the presidents' full involvement in the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>, it is hard to create the proper <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mood in the temple. Almost all the presidents in the zone are former traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men who have taken up the leading roles in the temples in order to expand the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. The presidents and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leaders work closely together. Their combined efforts in preaching and management well support the book distribution, and the devotees on the street feel secure and inspired. Every weekend the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees hold a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> meeting for an hour or more and discuss the latest <em>saṅkīrtana</em> techniques and philosophy.

Your wonderful <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees uplift this ISKCON movement by spreading Your glories everywhere. Please bless all Your dedicated <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and women throughout the world and grant them the mercy available at Your lotus feet. All glories to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees!

sub=Books Are the Greatest Weapons

To serve Lord Caitanya means to deliver His message to the fallen souls all over the world. Whoever we are and wherever we may be, our duty is to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all people, so that they can understand how, why, and what self-realization is. They don't know what it is, why they should do it, or how to do it. Therefore we give them Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, so that they can learn what, why, and how.

When you talk to somebody, he may listen for some time, but then he either argues with you or goes away and forgets everything. Very few people can tolerate even the idea of somebody preaching to them, but taking a book is less of a commitment in their eyes. You say, “Take one of these books home; they are very nice and full of ancient wisdom," and they think,

"If I have to listen to this person, then he's in control. But if I take a book, I'm in control. I can control a book. It's just pieces of paper. It does what I want. I can read it in my armchair at home and accept or reject it as I like. If I want it to sit on the bookshelf, it sits on the bookshelf. When I don't want it to talk to me, I don't look at it. I'm the controller. I can take a book.”

You can even let them know it: “There's no difficulty or commitment. You can read it when you want. It does not demand anything of you. It only gives.” But when they open these books, Prabhupāda is preaching to them and they cannot just put him down. They have no chance to speculate or consider themselves the controller when he is speaking. They are automatically controlled until they finally surrender. But they don't know that, for it is hidden.

These books are the greatest weapons. We are not interested in guns or other weapons; they are not practical—they sometimes make holes in one's head. The best thing is to distribute billions of books, mountains and truckloads of books. Let a rain of transcendental literature fall from the sky, but let not one touch the ground. Distribute the books on their merit. Then each book will be a powerful weapon that will enter the home and destroy the darkness of ignorance in the hearts of the masses.

Nothing can compare to the transcendental distribution of these books. Our book distribution is revolutionary because when people learn about the spiritual quality of life, they will naturally and automatically want to change the way modern society is running.

With these words we lovingly kick you out the door to expand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement by inspired preaching and book distribution, without envy or selfish interests. Don't be a miser, thinking that these books look very nice piled up in your storehouse. Pour the rain of mercy on all classes of men everywhere without any discrimination. Then everyone will get the highest benefit, both yourself and the rest of the world as well.

sub=The Highest Welfare Work for Humanity

Śrīla Prabhupāda's books teach one to come out of the darkness and come to the light: “Come out of the miserable condition of material existence and become Kṛṣṇa's eternal servant! Become free from the material creation and go back home, back to Godhead, where you belong!” By distributing these books we are doing the highest welfare work for humanity at large. Sometimes people complain, "Why don't you go and get a job? Why don't you do something for the people?" But we are doing something for the people. We are giving them spiritual knowledge that frees them from the cycle of birth and death. They don't understand that we are doing the highest service for the people because they don't understand that the supreme goal of life is to surrender to Viṣṇu.

"Distribute books" is not a cheap slogan like "power to the people.” It is a sublime instruction that gives a process for the welfare of a world suffering under the illusory concept of life. The only solution is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. How will they ever know that they should surrender to Kṛṣṇa if they don't get Śrīla Prabhupāda's books? On every page Prabhupāda is saying, “Surrender to Kṛṣṇa. You are not this body; you are a part of the Supreme.” Therefore our duty is clear. We should go on distributing books more and more.

Nothing is lost by distributing books. We have seen in other parts of the world that they collect like mad to acquire places of residence; but in this zone, where distributing books is the primary concern, we have seen at least three different places donated freely. In other parts of the world this is unheard of, but because of our eagerness to distribute these books, Kṛṣṇa says, “Yes. Here, take this place.” Kṛṣṇa can give us the whole world if He wants. We should try to surrender fully to Kṛṣṇa and, under His direction, preach for the sake of the entire world and distribute these books like anything.

Now we are nearing the most glorious time of the year the Prabhupāda Christmas Marathon. It is an ideal time for delivering the fallen souls. Out of sentiment, people save money all year to buy something. Therefore we bring them the transcendental gift of incalculable value. We say, “Here, if you really want to have a happy Christmas, this is the way to do it. Transcendentalize your existence; try to become spiritual.” We give them these books freely, without the mental obstruction: “Oh, will they take it?" We are bold and confident: “Here! Take it! Touch this book, read one word and you will be benefited.” What to speak of reading a few chapters of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>! Even if a person reads a few chapters and concludes that he doesn't understand anything, he has still read a few chapters of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>. That means in the future he will read <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> again and eventually come to the spiritual world.

When we distribute books, we meditate on how it is an extraordinary activity. We are not only doing it because it pleases the spiritual master. If one thinks like that, one could think, "Oh, I can please my spiritual master if I cook a nice pizza pie." Book distribution is the highest activity. <em>Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ</em>—it cleanses the mirror of the heart, the consciousness, <em>ceta</em>. <em>Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ</em>—it takes one out of the ocean of material suffering, material birth and death. It is the highest welfare work for humanity, because it spreads the cooling rays of the benediction moon and calms the burning fire of saṁsāra, repeated birth and death.

sub=We Have to Beat Māyā

It becomes clear in the Prabhupāda Marathon that there are different levels of distributors. The <em>mahā-rathis</em> can do more than five hundred books a day and the <em>rathis</em> can do four hundred. But even if you can do only five books a day, do whatever you can because we want you to taste the ecstasy of this transcendental distribution. Even if you can only do a little, you will experience the great ecstasy of this distribution. Therefore in the Prabhupāda Marathon we should empty the temples completely. Everyone, except maybe one <em>pūjārī</em>, should go out.

We create a little social pressure at marathon time because it pushes us to go out. Otherwise we think, "Oh, the marathon. The big <em>mahā-rathis</em> will do enough. It doesn't matter if I don't do anything and go to sleep in a corner of the temple.” No! One should feel some social pressure: "Hey, what are you doing?"

"Who, me? I wasn't doing anything, just cleaning the floor.”

"Hey! This is no time to be wallowing in <em>māyā</em>. Get out the door!" It is good to get a kick in the pants now and then.

But then don't start thinking, “Oh, heavy! I've got to go out for four weeks and beat this one, that one, and the other one. It's going to be tough. What a struggle! My fame! If I don't defeat everybody, I won't be famous. What will the others think of me? At the end, when everyone is beating on the drums and screaming, 'Hari bol!' and it comes to my name and I'm only number ten-how terrible that will be!" If you think like that, <em>māyā</em> has already succeeded at sneaking in and capturing you. You should think, “I have to do my best. With all my energy, determination, and enthusiasm, I'll distribute these books for Kṛṣṇa.” Never think, “I've got to be number this or that. Only if I beat this dāsa or that devī dāsī will I be happy.” You have to beat <em>māyā</em> and that is all. <em>Māyā</em> tries to engage you in all sorts of artificial battles to make you miserable. We can beat <em>māyā</em> if we remain transcendental and just try to satisfy the Supreme Lord by going out and distributing as much as we can.

Our bliss comes from killing the people's demoniac mentality with these books. To kill their bodies just puts off the troubles into the future. The same demons would take birth again and create another set of troubles. Therefore we should go on with this transcendental literature distribution mission and conquer the demoniac mentality. That is the most wonderful way to satisfy Śrīla Prabhupāda, get his mercy, and go back home, back to Godhead.

sub=Give One Hundred Percent

To think that setting higher quotas will expand book distribution is a misconception. The quota is to do as much as you can. We do not say, “You must do this much,” because we are not fruitive. Therefore we never make quotas; we simply say, “Do what you can and then do some more — depend on Kṛṣṇa and see how much more He can do." Prepare yourself like that. Pray to Kṛṣṇa to become free of the tendency to hold something back. Sometimes we give only fifty percent of our capacity in a day. That is not good. We will not be losers if we give one hundred percent of our capacity. Kṛṣṇa will take care of us, He will carry what we lack and preserve what we have. He will give us the strength to conquer material nature and continue with the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to say, “Kṛṣṇa doesn't look so much at what you are doing as at what you are holding back.” If you don't give one hundred percent to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, you are holding back some of your energies for your own self-interest. Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer or give away, and whatever austerities you perform should be done as an offering to Me." Kṛṣṇa didn't say "some of the things that you do." He didn't say “part-time,” or “when you're not busy doing something else.” He said, “All of it! Give Me everything!” Still, what we are able to give is an insignificant offering because we are such limited spirit souls. To give everything to Kṛṣṇa is just enough; anything less is not enough. Kṛṣṇa doesn't look so much at what we do as at what we hold back.

A <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee should be trained to give one hundred percent of his capacity to the service of the Supreme Lord. One devotee's capacity might be one hundred books a day and another devotee's capacity might be five hundred. If both are giving one hundred percent, they are considered equal in the eyes of the Lord. We may glorify more the one doing big, which is also good, but the Lord is satisfied to see both devotees giving one hundred percent.

One with the capacity to increase should do so; otherwise there is a danger he will become complacent, thinking, “There is no need to do more. I have done good enough. I can stop pushing." One may think this pushing is bad, but this pushing is what keeps us Kṛṣṇa conscious. Somebody should always be lighting some fire under us, so that we feel the heat to preach more or distribute more books to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When we come back to the temple, we can have a good <em>kīrtana</em> and collapse in exhaustion, having given one hundred percent in the service of the Supreme Lord.

sub=Determining Your Pace

In a marathon you must learn to pace yourself. You go at such a speed that you can get into a rhythm. If you go too slow, you become lethargic. If you go too fast, you break down. It is called pacing yourself. There is no formula for finding your optimal pace because everybody is different; it must be done individually. During the marathon you distribute as you would during the rest of the year, but also let yourself get wrapped up in the energy of the marathon. Then a gradual increase will automatically take place, culminating in the last week, when you can give everything you have left to give. (This may mean that you have to spend some time in January recovering.)

In 1985 in Argentina we started a ten-year marathon. Usually people go up and down from one marathon to the next. One year they are big stars, and the next year they are gone. The "ten-year marathon list” is amazing because it shows who has steadily been going on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> over the years. Everyone should develop the commitment to go on steadily, year after year. A perfect example of this steadiness is Rohiṇī-suta Prabhu, who has been going out since 1973. Through his constant endeavor he has distributed so many books. Of course, nowadays he distributes a little less because he helps others become book distributors—but he still goes out. You should think like that and have long-term vision. If you cannot do big in the marathon, don't be discouraged. Think about how your long-term, steady service will satisfy your spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa very much.

sub=Books Are the Solution

The people on the street are filled with desires, and usually the desire to have one of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is not among them. Therefore the book distributor, as Kṛṣṇa's representative, creates within the people's hearts the desire to take these books. Otherwise, how will they ever become happy? No matter how hard they try, they cannot satisfy all their material desires.

You can tell the people what Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>—<em>janma - mṛtyu - jarā - vyādhi - duḥkha - doṣānudarśanam</em>. You say, “My dear sir, you should be aware of the great problems of life, namely, birth, death, old age, and disease. Some rare philosophers might speculate about these problems, but most people don't speak about them because they are not aware that there is a solution. They think that death is unbeatable. Your death will also come, sir, so you should think about what you are going to do about it. These books have the only solution to the problems of birth, death, old age, and disease. Unless you study this Vedic literature, you'll never find the solution. Never! Therefore, you must take these books."

We distribute these books to the people of the world, so that they will understand their constitutional position to love and serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead and satisfy Him with the results of their activities. Everyone wants to love and be loved. Everyone wants to be peaceful, satisfied, and happy. If you show a list of these desires to anyone, he will say, “Yes, that's what I want.” But in the material world it is not possible to have peace, satisfaction, happiness, and love unless you are a devotee of the Lord. The material world simply does not have the facility to offer such satisfaction. The only way to attain all these desirable things is to take the first and topmost step toward surrender to Kṛṣṇa by buying one of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Śrīla Prabhupāda said, “Know for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of my books.” Know it for certain! You may preach some words to somebody for a short time, but when you walk away he will forget everything you said. Therefore, we leave people with a book to refer to later. It may sit on the shelf, but it will wait for them to open it and read a few lines, pages, chapters, or maybe even the whole book. Then when they open it, they will be able to understand Kṛṣṇa because they will have heard from Kṛṣṇa's pure devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Even hearing a little bit about Kṛṣṇa can change their lives. Everyone who hears about Kṛṣṇa or chants Kṛṣṇa's name takes the first step on the path of gradually becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious.

During marathon times we should fix our minds on just distributing the mercy. The first week of a marathon is usually a little difficult. The spirit has not yet fully picked up; many devotees are coming out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> for the first time or for the only time all year. The second week picks up substantially, and by the third week things are flying, as everyone gets into the spirit of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. This period—the week before Christmas - is the most auspicious time of the year to distribute books. While everyone is in a time warp, foolishly spending their money on material sense gratification, we slip in. We grab the hearts of the conditioned souls and give them the greatest investment they could ever make. We give spiritual life, an investment that can satisfy all their deep desires.

That is why we go out like madmen to distribute these books by the hundreds, thousands, and millions! What else is there to do in December? December is the time to distribute the mercy! Shut down the temples! No more problems! That is what marathon is all about. We get the mercy by distributing the mercy. It is the means to become truly satisfied. Devotees know well the art of becoming satisfied. They know that satisfaction in the material world is impossible and real satisfaction is possible only through full surrender to the Supreme Lord. Therefore, we should enthusiastically flood the world with Kṛṣṇa conscious books and spread this book distribution mission far and wide.

sub=Marathon Is Nothing for the Body

It is amazing how everybody becomes ecstatic by simply distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books during the marathon. Materially it is very difficult: we are running here and there, always carrying books, and hardly getting enough sleep or proper <em>prasādam</em> to eat. Yet it becomes so ecstatic because it is just service and nothing for the body. When we make arrangements to ensure that the body is well taken care of, it is hard to feel ecstatic. Our minds and desires become more absorbed in the body, and we forget the spiritual energy. We forget that we are serving Kṛṣṇa and start thinking that we are enjoying. But when we are working extremely hard, even under difficult circumstances, we become very ecstatic because it has nothing to do with the body, sense gratification, or material enjoyment.

The marathon is the time to give out, and the non-marathon time is the time to absorb in. But one should always have a morning program, even during marathon. It can be compressed into thirty minutes. Don't just chant your rounds and run out the door, because you need spiritual strength.

You still should read. You can unwind at the end of the day by reading <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> book for forty minutes before taking rest. During marathon one gets into a state of madness, which has advantages and disadvantages. Maybe it is necessary to make a little sign in the van by your sleeping place, so you don't forget to read before taking rest.

It is good that the marathon inspires you to do more, but it is not good to lapse into complacency when it is over. When you have a mental concept of "Marathon!” and afterward the idea “Marathon is over,” the results fall dramatically. The distribution time between marathon and non-marathon differs maybe one hour, so the result should not reduce more than one hour's worth of distribution. You should keep on going at the same pace and maintain the marathon mood of inspiration to increase. I wish the whole year could be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> marathon. We should declare every year a marathon and always increase with more marathons until finally we realize that our entire existence is one big marathon.

sub=Think Positive

Since there are so many things to do for Kṛṣṇa, we should be determined not to waste any more time in pursuit of sense gratification. When we are determined in this way and go about our devotional service fearlessly, enthusiastically, and optimistically, we will surely attain success in this life. I have seen these qualities completely transform a place. When I first came to Germany, the devotees were walking around the temple, lamenting piteously: “It's hopeless. What's the use? We're finished.” Upon seeing this I made a propaganda campaign: I walked around the temple, saying, “It's hopeful. It's definitely getting better. Very good. Excellent.” I kept it a secret but tricked two devotees into taking my side in the campaign. We just kept pumping out good propaganda. After a while the devotees began to wake up and think, “It's not so bad.” They realized how good it was and started distributing ten times more than anyone else in the world. Wonderful things were done because they started thinking how auspicious, workable, and blissful everything was.

Do you know about the power of positive thinking? If you think that you are finished, then you are finished. That is why before a boxing match the two fighters come into the middle of the ring and stare at each other. One tries to look at the other stronger because as soon as one of the fighters thinks, "Now I'm finished,” although he may be stronger and better, he is finished.

We have to develop positive thinking. If you think that you can do it, then you can do it. If you think that you can distribute one thousand books a day, then somehow you will figure out how to do it. One thousand books is only twenty-five to thirty sets a day. You just have to meet thirty people who take a set. It becomes possible as soon as you start thinking that it is possible. It is a question of having the right attitude. You have to depend on Kṛṣṇa. Remember, Kṛṣṇa is God: If Kṛṣṇa desires something to happen, it happens; if He wants you to distribute one thousand books a day, you will do it, although you may not understand how it is happening. Simply link up with the desire of the Lord and do unlimitedly wonderful things.

Have some faith in Kṛṣṇa! The best way to develop that faith is to start thinking that it is possible —in other words, it is up to you. If you want to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and do wonderful things for Kṛṣṇa, you will. If you don't, you will not, no matter what anyone says. If you think, “Nice talk, but impractical,” then nothing will happen. Even if somebody walks up to you on the street and wants to give you a million dollars, you will think, “Ah, he doesn't want anything anyway.” One with the proper attitude thinks, “I'm Kṛṣṇa's representative and Kṛṣṇa wants wonderful things to happen," and goes out with optimism, enthusiasm, and determination. Kṛṣṇa is ready to turn over the world to you; He is just waiting for you to develop a little faith.

We come to that point by simply doing it. Some devotees say, “How can I do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>? My head, my mind, my this, and my that… ” and we reply,

“Just go and do it!"<br />&emsp;"But, but, but… "<br />&emsp;"Just try it!"<br />&emsp;"But, but, but…"<br />&emsp;"Do it!"<br />&emsp;"But…"<br />&emsp;"Just go!"<br />&emsp;"All right.”

Then they try, and it gets better and better. Soon they are doing fine. It is possible. Simply by trying, everything occurs. Just throw yourself into the middle of this very merciful mission, and you will attain wonderful results.

sub=Distributing in the City

You are in the big city now and not in the country, where the farmers are. City people are sophisticated, intelligent, and successful. You have to approach them properly. You have to be strong, clear, crisp, and heavy enough to break their illusion of sophistication. You have to grab them (I do not mean physically) and hold them with your spiritual strength and conviction.

You are trying to be nice guys. You approach the people with, “Oh, please, sir…” and you just get brushed aside: “Get out of here!” Being a nice guy with a big gushy heart is useless. It gets you nowhere. We have a service to do. After Arjuna heard the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, he went onto the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and fought, and that is what you have to do. You have to do your service like a thunderbolt. It is not the time for the rose. A devotee has a rose and a thunderbolt, but he shows each according to the situation. Now is the time for the thunderbolt, so put the rose away. You cannot be such a nice guy. Purification does not necessarily mean you become a nice guy. That is what Arjuna thought before he heard the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, and the whole <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> deals with this illusion. There is a saying in America: “Nice guys finish last.” Everybody walks over your head if you try to be nice, because nobody is a nice guy. Do you want to give a nice picture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Are a bunch of wet dishrags a nice picture? The Christian monks already have that image, and nobody cares about them. You have to be tough. This is Kali-yuga. People respect power nowadays—not wishy-washy dishrags.

You are such soft and sweet devotees. You are so kindhearted that you are letting the <em>karmīs</em> go to hell. This is your mercy. Isn't that nice of you? “Oh, yes, my dear materialist, you can jump in the lake and kill yourself. You can cut your throat. You can become a dog, you'll like it.” That means you are complete fools, without the faintest idea of what you are doing. You are like a doctor who should cut away a boil but doesn't cut because the patient says, “Oh, it hurts!” and later the whole arm has to be amputated. Such a doctor is so “kind” and "pleasing.” Is that what you want to do? If it is the time to cut, then get the knife and cut! We are not sentimentalists; otherwise how could I insult everybody like this? If I were a sentimentalist, I would say, "Oh, my beloved disciples, just do your best.” Rascals, fools, and nonsenses: Get out there and do something!

sub=Reciprocation

As soon as you surrender to book distribution, you directly experience Kṛṣṇa reciprocating with you at every moment. Amazing things begin to happen. Kṛṣṇa starts arranging favorable circumstances and guiding you to people who take books. This occurs because of the Lord's presence. When you simply think, "Please, Kṛṣṇa, help me distribute Your books,” Kṛṣṇa responds, “Yes, I would love to help you distribute more books.” The Supreme Lord is in the heart, and one can work in direct and constant contact with Him. Of course this connection takes time; it is not something you can do overnight or even in a few years. Yet if we surrender to Kṛṣṇa fully, He takes charge of our lives. He personally runs the life of anyone preaching for Him. Thus the book distributors are the most fortunate. They get the best chance to surrender, the best opportunity for serving, and the best facilities for going home, back to Godhead. All perfection comes to them. They are no longer bound to this material world.

A devotee comes before the Supreme Personality of Godhead full of love for the Lord. He is happy to see the Lord. But don't think that it just goes one way. The Lord is also happy to see the devotee. When the curtains open in the morning you are happy to see the Deities, and the Deities are happy to see you. Of course, the Deities are always happy because bliss is Their nature. Yet I have seen that when the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees come to the temple, the Deities are much happier. They are happy to see Their wonderful devotees before Them—chanting and dancing in ecstasy—and you become very happy to see Them happy. This is the transcendental way of loving reciprocation and relationship.

sub=Real Unity

Real unity is when the desire of the devotee and the desire of the Supreme Personality of Godhead become one. The devotee becomes happy because he is not separated from Kṛṣṇa in any way. He becomes powerful and nobody can stop him because Kṛṣṇa's desire is so strong that it immediately becomes fact. Thus anyone who engages in the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> immediately becomes successful because Kṛṣṇa wants the living entities to be given this transcendental literature far more than we do. Kṛṣṇa wants them to come back home, back to Godhead. Therefore, wherever we are situated within this preaching mission, we should make Kṛṣṇa's desire our desire. We become convinced of what Kṛṣṇa desires from us in two ways: Kṛṣṇa inspires us from within the heart, and the spiritual master externally tells us what to do.

sub=Detachment from Fruitive Mentality

The performer of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness process gradually realizes that he is not the doer and thus becomes detached from the fruits of his actions. Almost everyone is attached to the fruits of his actions, although attachment destroys the activity. For example, if you are distributing books and are attached to the fruit of your work, you will think about the amount of books you are distributing. Then the people on the street will look at you and think, "He's a fruitive worker like me, but he looks funny and his books look strange.” They will walk over your head without any respect, and they will not take anything. But if you are distributing to satisfy your spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Caitanya, and you are trying to help the conditioned souls, a completely different vibration comes from you. People will be drawn to you and they will gladly take a book, because they will feel that this is something special and that it involves higher principles —not that you are merely trying to make a sale. It is so important to develop this detachment from the fruitive mentality. It brings success in spiritual life. And it begins by your understanding that you are not the doer or the controller.

Kṛṣṇa sometimes allows you to become bewildered, so that you understand that you are not the controller. It is an interesting experience. Let us say you are distributing books, convinced that you are the controller. You try to act like a controller, but it doesn't work. You become bewildered. Nobody stops to listen to you. You are spinning around on the street, wondering, “What's going on?” Then Kṛṣṇa in the heart says, "Fool! Don't you know yet that you are not the controller? Why don't you surrender to Me and see what happens?" Finally you come to the point of surrender: “Kṛṣṇa! You are the controller. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare." Then amazingly things start to change. You come out of bewilderment and can serve Kṛṣṇa again. This bewildering effect of material nature is Kṛṣṇa's direct mercy on the living entities to teach them that they are not the controllers. The material nature helps us to surrender by repeatedly beating us until we realize that we are not the controllers.

sub=You Cannot Cheat on the Street

A successful preacher in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission must conquer lust, anger, and greed from deep within his heart, because these inauspicious desires always demand but never give respect. Therefore Lord Caitanya instructs us to always give respect to others without expecting respect in return and to always be tolerant like a tree, devoid of false prestige. These key qualities are necessary to perform the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission perfectly, whether one is chanting the holy name of the Lord, distributing the literature of the Lord, or preaching about the Lord. These qualities make one successful in spiritual life.

Much of the preaching mission depends on the consciousness of the preacher. At <em>saṅkīrtana</em> meetings, sometimes devotees ask for tips on technique—but technique can only take you so far. You can hold the book this way or hold the book that way; you can say it like this or say it like that. The basic techniques can be learned in a couple of days. Whenever a neophyte <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee asks an older <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee for some tips, the answer is always, “You have to surrender and learn how to depend on Kṛṣṇa. Success will come when you give up prestige, false ego, and personal satisfaction and just work for Kṛṣṇa." Still the neophyte thinks, "Oh, he's keeping the secrets to himself.”

You cannot hide and cheat on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Behind an office door you can hide and cheat all you like and make a convincing show of success, because the material nature is meant for cheating. On <em>saṅkīrtana</em> you cannot hide behind a door because there is no door. You are face to face with reality. The spiritual reality is how much you depend on Kṛṣṇa. Those without faith in Kṛṣṇa hide, and those with faith in Kṛṣṇa go out and expand that faith by practical action. Nothing expands your spiritual life better than stepping onto the street first thing in the morning with some of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. It brings you face to face with the spiritual reality that you are not the controller. You have nobody to tell what to do, nobody to do anything for you, and no minor activity to hide behind. It is just you and the people you preach to. They couldn't care less whether you are a “big devotee.” They don't even know what it means. They don't care if you are an expert in something or if others scream and shout your name. All they know is what they see right in front of them.

You are tested every minute. When you say, "Here I am, O conditioned soul. Please take this book," he looks you in the face and asks, “Why should I?” If you hesitate, “Uh, well. Uh, because you're supposed to,” you will not convince anyone. You must tell him,

“My dear sir, in this book you'll find answers to questions that cannot be phrased properly in the material world. The problems of life are so deep that one doesn't even know what the question is, what to speak of the answer. We've accepted a painful condition as normal, and we don't even realize that it can be questioned. Questions like, 'What am I doing? Why am I here? What am I meant to be?' aren't even allowed to be thought in the material world. In this book Mahārāja Parīkṣit asks the greatest authority in existence, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the questions we should ask; but because we cannot, he does it for us. This book perfectly describes the best questions and answers. That's why you should buy one.”

We are carrying living books in our hands. They are not ordinary dead literature that you forget about. This literature has never deviated from its essential message since time immemorial.

Therefore these books are important, and we must read them. How else will you get the knowledge and faith to speak about them? You cannot cheat when you are preaching. It may look good, but it will not mean anything unless you have the realization of the Supreme Absolute Truth that comes from reading and studying this transcendental literature. You cannot distribute this literature unless you know it. Therefore we insist on everybody learning. The preachers and book distributors are the scholarly representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for their lives are absorbed in these books.

Not everybody has the wonderful opportunity to be absorbed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, and some will avoid it at all costs. Yet those who take it up, at least in the Prabhupāda Marathon, realize the importance of this activity. It is the surest and most effective way to realize Kṛṣṇa.

sub=Creating Enthusiasm

When a devotee's consciousness is low, he may become cold and calculating. He squeezes as much money as he can out of “these sinful people.” When the people respond by being unenthusiastic, everything becomes a big mess as the devotee and the people become heavier and heavier with each other. The devotee's consciousness on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is so important. He must speak to people with a feeling of love in order to inspire them to act with piety and devotion. When people meet such an enthusiastic devotee, they immediately become enthusiastic. Even if they don't understand what he is talking about, they still want to give a donation.

Learning to create enthusiasm in others is very important. This enthusiasm is what the spiritual masters arouse in their disciples. Out of improper understanding the disciples may not reciprocate, but the spiritual master still instructs them and changes their understanding. Vaiṣṇavas who understand the Absolute Truth give although no one reciprocates.

One has to be spiritually powerful to create enthusiasm within the human society. That is the principle behind book distribution. Who is more qualified than Śrīla Prabhupāda to make the human society enthusiastic? Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are eternal. Anybody who has Śrīla Prabhupāda's books cannot remain unenthusiastic. Therefore we are pumping them into the human society without stop, so that people will gradually become more and more enthusiastic. Often we hear how so-and-so made this or that person a devotee, but in my opinion the books make more devotees than all of us put together.

sub=Distributing for the Proper Price

People need to understand the value of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Thus the distributor needs to understand their value himself. When he understands, so will the people. If you approach a person, thinking, “I know you don't want this book, but I'm going to try to induce you to take it. It's as cheap as I can possibly give it, the cost of the printing. Just give something, anything. Please!" then you project this idea onto the person, and he will think, “It's not worth much, so I'll give him as little as I can get away with or nothing at all.” This is the fault of the distributor, who should understand the value of these books. One book is worth more than its weight in gold. It is the most valuable thing. Only twice the BBT price is an insult. These books would cost much more in a bookstore. We give out books so ridiculously cheap out of our mercy and because we are not greedy.

By distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books in enormous quantities everywhere, people will understand what real philosophy is. Sometimes they say, “These books are too difficult to understand,” but nothing is difficult about it. Anyone can understand these books. They find it difficult because they think that “It's all one" or "It's all nothing" or that they should only eat, sleep, mate, and defend. They don't want to understand this philosophy, because they will realize that their lives are a waste of time.

They should surrender to Kṛṣṇa and go back to Godhead, but their minds rebel against this because their senses control their minds. They think, “Since these books are telling me to surrender, it's better that I don't understand anything and put the book away.” But at some point they will have to surrender because they bought a book and didn't throw it away. That is why we don't give out these books for free. If we would, we would find them all thrown away. Instead of thinking, "What? God? Surrender? Never! Throw it out!” they think, “What? God? Surrender? Never!” and put it on the shelf. Then their children come along when no one is looking and pick out the book, and they read it, “Yes, that's right. Kṛṣṇa,” and they become devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

sub=Respecting the Books

If someone respectfully hands you a book, you automatically become respectful. For example, in Japan they understand the value of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. In the early days people would often wash their money before giving it to the devotees, because they didn't want to give dirty money for such beautiful books.

It is our responsibility to properly prepare people to receive these books. When we bring somebody to the Deity greeting, we don't walk into the temple room with our shoes on, zoom open the curtain, and say, "Here are the Deities," and then zoom shut the curtain. People should respect the Deities, so before entering the temple room, we make them take their shoes off; upon entering the temple room, we bow down, blow the conchshell, and ring the bell; and when the curtain opens, we bow down before the Deities and offer <em>ārati</em> and prayers. It creates an atmosphere of respect for the Deities.

We should keep that same respectful atmosphere around the books. I have seen books treated with disrespect, even by devotees. To throw books on the floor, cut out the verses, cut out the pictures and paste them on the wall, mark up books with notes or underlining, or tear the plastic wrapper off new books just to read them once, so that they cannot be distributed anymore, is very disrespectful and one loses the proper mood.

In some places we have ruined our image by cheating or trickery. We become merely businessmen, and the people see us as money swindlers. If we can learn some respect for ourselves and the activity of distributing transcendental literature, we will do it in a way so that nobody feels that it is something cheap. If you understand how the wonderful philosophy in these books will change the world by making a spiritual revolution in the hearts of men, you will respect these books and you will become spiritually empowered to project that respect onto others. Just by doing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> you become a self-realized soul, and when you are self-realized you will do it better.

sub=Straightforward Presentation

People appreciate a straightforward presentation. In New York we used to distribute in subway trains. Upon entering the train carriage, the devotees would make announcements about Indian relief work or drug rehabilitation. But being from New York, I was convinced that nobody heard much of what we said even if they wanted to, because the door was slamming shut and the train was moving. The people sitting on the train suddenly see this weird-looking guy in devotional clothing appear at the end of the carriage. He announces something and then goes around smiling and shaking a donation can. The people are trained-up: If a can is placed in front of them, they put something in it, they get something to read, and everything is OK. We used to give them the pamphlet <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Reservoir of Pleasure</em> and some <em>prasādam</em>. The people liked it.

I didn't want to waste my time vibrating mundane sounds all day, so I started to make announcements like, “By the mercy of Gaura-Nitāi, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading love of Godhead all over the world. You can help. Give a nickel, a dime, a quarter, a dollar, or whatever you can.” My partner and I were both from the Bronx. We used to do the Number Six train, which goes to the Bronx. All the people from the Bronx realized from our accents that we were also from the Bronx. Since I did better than everybody, soon the other distributors started making similar announcements: “By the mercy of the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana. By the mercy of Rādhā-Govinda.” The presentation was straightforward and successful.

The biggest hang-up to success is in the mind. If you approach somebody thinking, “Oh, I'm a Hare Kṛṣṇa, and you're not going to like this," and present the book in an apologetic, negative way, you will not have much success. You must have a positive frame of mind, because you control the person with your mind. A good book distributor can take over the minds of the <em>karmīs</em>. When he is talking, you have no choice but to listen. He knows the art of taking over someone's mind like a good salesman would, but he does it in a spiritual way and the effect is devastating.

You have to think positive and have a positive understanding. Then you can go into somebody's mind and control it by positive Kṛṣṇa conscious power. You know that what you are doing is right and good, and the person you are talking to also knows it. Therefore saying that this is Hare Kṛṣṇa is not a problem. Of course this is Hare Kṛṣṇa. Who else would do such a wonderful thing?

The <em>karmī</em> considers himself a powerful person. Yet a boy has managed to stop and capture him. Through this subtle interplay, the devotee earns the respect of the <em>karmī</em>, saying in effect, “You're so great, and yet I'm stopping you and we are having a discussion. Imagine how powerful I must be. Who is giving me that power? Just read this book!” These words are never spoken, but that is what happens.

The <em>karmīs</em> are on ego trips, especially in the business world; everyone is trying to overpower the others on subtle levels: “My suit is better than your suit. Look at the gold watch I have.” We should be similarly powerful and concentrated, always thinking about our purpose and depending on Kṛṣṇa in the heart.

When Harināmānanda dāsa looks at people and his eyes lock into their eyes, they cannot stop looking at him. He hands the book to them and their hands reach out and take it, and after a while, he gives them another one and then another. He averages about seven per person, and if they take all seven without blinking, he gives them a set. Sometimes he sells two sets a day on the street. By his spiritual power he forces people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, and they never complain. They appreciate his power and walk away feeling blissful.

Not all book distributors come across super-powerful. Some are more mellow and others more kind. The girls don't come across with power but with kindness. This melts men's hearts because they don't find this quality of kindness in their wives. According to each person's capacity, each has a particular way to distribute with potency.

sub=Recognizing the Nature of Others

Every book distributor should know basic sales techniques. They have to learn by practical experience because in every country people will present themselves in a specific manner. With some experience a distributor will be able to keep a person's attention. He has to figure out more or less what the person does by guessing or questioning — “What do you do? Where do you come from?” That forces a person to relate to you. But questions can also annoy a person, because he doesn't have any particular commitment to the situation he has run into. If you can guess a person's occupation, then he becomes amazed. A book distributor develops a second sense for it, and when he gets better and better at it, he can understand a person's mind and mood.

At least if he understands a person's mood, then he can say things that the person relates to. A devotee has to see from the other person's point of view. If the weather is enjoyable and people are in a good mood, you can say to someone, “It's really nice out, isn't it?" You don't say, “Lousy day, isn't it?” because he is not going to relate to that. For him, today is fine, and for a <em>karmī</em>, if it is fine one day, it is fine forever. You capture his mood, and he reciprocates with you immediately.

But sometimes you have to be really straightforward with somebody and dive directly into the business. People like it if you are businesslike when they are in a hurry. So you have to adjust. Don't start asking questions. Jump into selling the book, and the person will appreciate that. If you are standing in the rain or it is very cold, don't get into a long discourse about the books, because the person simply wants to move on. It takes a little common sense and a lot of experience. You must discriminate intelligently and judge the situations according to time, place, and circumstance.

sub=Push Yourself

One should be a gentleman on the street and not an over-pushy salesman. Otherwise people get annoyed. They don't like to be pushed around, but they are happy to meet a gentleman who does everything nicely. One must push oneself, so that he doesn't become overwhelmed by the lower modes of nature. Pushing oneself means pushing oneself out the door and pushing oneself from person to person quickly. But when he is talking to people, he is a gentleman and doesn't push them. Pushing oneself is possible, allowed, and desired, but pushing others is not.

<em>Māyā</em>, in her form of the modes of material nature, is always trying to defeat us. Whatever little advancement we make, <em>māyā</em> pushes back with strength. If we let <em>māyā</em> push us back, we are defeated. When a devotee surrenders to <em>māyā</em>, she says, “Ah, now I have you in my clutches… ” and he chokes. But if he makes the effort, and <em>māyā</em> sees him pushing through—not paying any attention to her attempts—she lets go and becomes respectful. Prabhupāda always used to tell us, “You just make the effort. In coming to America, I had the impossible task to make people Kṛṣṇa conscious who had no idea of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who were addicted to every conceivable kind of sinful activity. I am just one man and I am old, but in my little way, I tried.” Prabhupāda was always busy trying, and because of trying he always succeeded.

sub=Pray to Kṛṣṇa and Try

If you just pray to Kṛṣṇa and try, then you can do wonderful things. Just pray to Kṛṣṇa, “Please, my dear Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, give me Your energy to do this service that you want done.” You will be amazed at how much energy you get, amazed at what happens. But if you think, “Here I am," and the trumpets sound: “Ace distributor number one hitting the streets again,” then <em>māyā</em> blows her trumpets: “Māyādevī number one hitting ace distributor number one,” and you are finished. That is the way it works. Therefore you must approach this service in a humble state of mind, thinking, “O Kṛṣṇa, if I'm not careful, <em>māyā</em> will blow her trumpets and send her agents to steal me away from Your service and ruin me.”

First we have to understand that we are helpless and insignificant — just small peanuts in the crowd. We need to pray to Kṛṣṇa, “Kṛṣṇa, my Lord, inspire me from within the heart. Without You I'm nothing. Unless You help, direct, and inspire me, I can accomplish nothing.” Then one can do anything. That is not an idle claim or some nice talk. Have faith in Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and daily pray, “Kṛṣṇa, I'm helpless. I have no strength on my own. Please put Your <em>śakti</em> in me: <em>kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana</em>. Let me be a receptacle of Your energy, and I promise I will do nothing but spread Your mission all day long.” Then Kṛṣṇa is ready to give you unlimited power and potency.

The only problem is you are not ready to take it because you are puffed up, thinking you are a big man: “I! Me! I can do it. I have power.” If you think you are an expert, <em>māyā</em> immediately sends an agent to push you over. When this happens, you can understand that Kṛṣṇa arranged it to straighten you out because you weren't surrendering. So if you want success, you have to become very, very humble and totally surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no possibility of success, nor happiness, nor peace.

sub=Don't Become Fried

During the book distribution day, sometimes devotees feel weak. It is too difficult for them to go on. In this condition some book distributors go to sleep, some sit and read, some eat <em>prasādam</em>, and some just go crazy. If you feel that you cannot go on, my advice is to stop going on. Bring yourself someplace where you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take out your beadbag, and walking back and forth, chant ten to sixteen rounds. Nothing is better than chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa to get your head together. We sometimes have to chant many rounds in one day to get ourselves together.

After you chant, sit down and read a little. Then you will have the strength to face the cruel material world again. Then if you feel all right but notice yourself gradually weakening again, I recommend that you chant between persons. Nothing is more powerful for the saṅkīrtaner than the holy name of the Lord, and no technique is better than to chant more. Taking a nap may be enlivening if you are tired, and that is OK. But if you are in <em>māyā</em>, taking a nap is the worst thing you can do. It throws you further into the mode of ignorance, with no chance to get out.

After many years of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, the devotee's body may start wearing down. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is one of the most physically taxing services. One may need more than six hours of sleep (maybe seven or eight hours), especially if he was a fanatic in the early days. Śrīla Prabhupāda authorized the taking of more rest by the book distributors because of the heavy physical activity required, so one should not feel bad about it. One should go to bed early and get up at a good time, so that throughout the day one has enough energy to do one's service.

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have to take care of their bodies. They should eat properly. (They should not throw some half-chewed peanuts down their throat that come out whole at the other end.) <em>Prasādam</em> should meet a proper standard. Every <em>saṅkīrtana</em> vehicle should have a little stove and a pressure cooker. One can cook <em>kicharī</em> with all kinds of vegetables in it or make <em>capātīs</em>. One can have bread from the temple with sufficient, but not too much, butter and some fresh tomatoes or other fruits. One should have a healthy, balanced diet.

Of course, one should not eat so well that it becomes a sense gratification party. This has happened in the past. In the guise of taking care of their bodies, the saṅkīrtaners fell asleep after eating and never got out the door. There must be a proper balance. One should eat properly and then go out and burn up some of those calories. Hanging around in the van after <em>prasādam</em> means death. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees may take a little break during the day to finish their rounds if necessary or to read a little bit to keep themselves Kṛṣṇa conscious.

I have been asking <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees to read two hours a day because they have to learn Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Prabhupāda told me in South Africa, “They think these books are just for selling, but actually I have written them for reading.” It is important to read these books. To distribute books for a lifetime means that one has to be firmly convinced that these books are the topmost perfection of literature in existence. You must read to purify your intelligence and develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you can read more and maintain the distribution results, it is all right to increase the allotted daily reading time. If you become so fired-up that you do the same or more than when you read less and go out all day, then it is authorized. Otherwise it is better to read two hours and go out all day.

If one falls into <em>māyā</em> during the day, he should chant more and read a little bit. Then he should get back on his feet and immediately strike back at <em>māyā</em> again. Don't let <em>māyā</em> get the upper hand on you. But if you become so fried out that you cannot go on, you should immediately go back to the temple and tell the president. You should get another service-going on <em>harināma</em>, distributing <em>prasādam</em>, helping in the kitchen, or worshiping the Deity. Don't worry! Every warrior in the battlefield becomes a little weak sometimes and has to go back to the base for a rest. After a short time, the spirit will well up again and you will want to go back out.

sub=Mandira Mā, Mārga Gama

Because we love Kṛṣṇa, we also love His parts and parcels. On the streets everywhere, the living entities are suffering in material existence. Therefore we want to give them a taste of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and what it means to go back home, back to Godhead. We are distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books in great quantities because we want to make Kṛṣṇa happy. Kṛṣṇa knows these living entities have rebelled against Him, and it is making Kṛṣṇa sad. To relieve the anxiety of the Lord and give Him pleasure, we want to bring the conditioned souls back to His lotus feet.

In the <em>Bṛhad-bhāgavatāmṛta</em> by Sanātana Gosvāmī, when Gopa Kumāra finally goes back to Goloka Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa sees him coming along the road toward His pastimes. The Lord runs toward him, embraces him in ecstasy, and falls down on the ground unconscious, thinking about His friend who has come back after such a long time. Can you imagine that? Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who has got millions and billions of devotees, falls over unconscious after embracing His devotee.

We cannot understand how satisfied Kṛṣṇa is when a devotee comes back to Him, let alone how much more satisfied Kṛṣṇa is with the person who has shown that devotee how to come back to Him. Kṛṣṇa says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, “There will never be anybody more dear to Me than he who teaches this sublime secret of devotional service to the devotees.” If you become instrumental in bringing a soul back to Godhead, your going back to Godhead is assured.

We distribute these books with the idea of giving people a chance to go back home, back to Godhead. Imagine how happy Kṛṣṇa is. He is happy because eventually these people will go back to Him. For each person we succeed in bringing back to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa becomes ecstatically overwhelmed with love.

We sometimes talk about <em>krpā-siddha</em>, the mercy of the Lord. By bringing some conditioned souls back to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, you will get the mercy of the Lord because He is so concerned that the devotees go back home, back to Godhead, and bring as many people as they can with them. This is the wonderful mission of Lord Caitanya's movement, and Śrīla Prabhupāda has arranged ISKCON in such a fantastic way, so that anyone who contacts ISKCON will get the opportunity to go back home, back to Godhead.

Please distribute these books and preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement like anything! Don't sit around in the temple all day! The <em>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad</em> states: <em>tamasi mā jyotir gama</em>, "Come out of the darkness and come to the light.” We have a new Vedic mantra: <em>mandira mā mārga gama</em>, “Get out of the temple and get on the street." <em>Mandira mā</em>— get out of the temple; <em>mārga gama</em> —go out on the streets and bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls.

Don't let material desires deviate you from <em>saṅkīrtana</em> even for a moment. Don't think that there is anything better to do. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is the best service for everybody. When this service is going on, everything in the temple is transformed to spiritual bliss. Places where no <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service goes on, I don't want to visit even in dreams, what to speak of physically. Since we want to keep visiting the temples in our zone, please go on with this service. Go on more and more, satisfying Kṛṣṇa, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and your spiritual master, and be happy.

sub=Intense Desire

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How do we develop an intense desire to do <em>saṅkīrtana?</em>

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You just have to meditate on it. Sometimes people think that mystic <em>yoga</em> is full of meditation and Kṛṣṇa consciousness is devoid of meditation, but that is not true. We do a lot of meditation. The difference is what we meditate on. We meditate on the spiritual master. For example, we meditate on how Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote these books with great difficulty and published the first books with great austerity, how he built up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement based on these books, how he encouraged everyone to distribute books, and how he said that our entire disciplic succession is happy when we distribute these books.

The spiritual masters in ISKCON are all followers of Śrīla Prabhupāda, and they all have an intense desire to please Śrīla Prabhupāda by distributing as many books as possible. Therefore by distributing books, we meditate on pleasing our spiritual master: "Through the mercy of my spiritual master, I can attain the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. When I please my spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa is pleased. When Kṛṣṇa is pleased, I become recognized by Him. When I become recognized by Kṛṣṇa, that's the perfection of life and there is nothing more to attain.” We should meditate just as any <em>yogi</em> in yogic practice would, fixing our minds on pleasing the spiritual master with one-pointed concentration.

The temple can be upside down, but we still concentrate on our services. Temple activities are diverse; there is cooking, cleaning, Deity worship, and distribution programs. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees know that hanging around the temple may divert their meditation from their service, so they like to travel in vans. In the van, sitting on a pile of books, there is nothing else but book distribution to meditate on. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is the factor that can elevate the <em>prākṛta-bhakta</em> to the higher stages of devotional service?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> <em>Prākṛta-bhaktas</em> can be elevated immediately by taking up the preaching mission. I prefer not to initiate anyone who has not done <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, preaching, or production of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. I personally feel that if you haven't done these things, you cannot feel mercy toward other living beings. You grow up crooked and twisted, thinking that life is meant for getting nice food to eat and a nice place to live.

You can develop the proper, higher consciousness by being put into circumstances that force you to act in such a way that understanding gradually comes. You must act in higher consciousness to develop it. You may repeatedly hear how you should act, but if you refuse to act accordingly, the desire to preach will never develop, and the desire to preach distinguishes the devotees on the higher stages of devotional service from the <em>prākṛta-bhaktas</em>. When a new devotee constantly hears that one should preach and distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the desire awakens within him and slowly develops into a burning desire. This desire develops by hearing, seeing the example of others, and acting accordingly. Finally he will say, “I'm sick of sitting around in the temple all day in this <em>bhakta</em> program. Let me out of here!"

sub=The Basis of Compassion

<strong>Devotee: </strong>What is the basis of compassion?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> When you know who you are, who Kṛṣṇa is, and who the other living entities are, you will see them as members of Kṛṣṇa's spiritual family. With such transcendental knowledge, you don't just see materialists running here and there; you see fallen conditioned souls, unable to understand themselves or Kṛṣṇa because they are struggling hard with the six senses, which include the mind. Therefore, you compassionately say to them, “Stop running around and take a look at what I have for you. Read this book, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take some <em>prasādam</em>, and be happy!”.

Knowledge of Kṛṣṇa will make you compassionate. This knowledge is the key that will open the door to transcendental liberation, and you can get the key from a saintly devotee of the Lord. If you want to be compassionate, you must associate with someone who is already compassionate. Śrīla Prabhupāda was so compassionate that in his old age, when anyone else would retire, he came to America, determined to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls. Because Prabhupāda was so compassionate, we can become compassionate by associating with him. Compassion is learned from one who has learned to be compassionate from one who has learned to be compassionate. Our disciplic succession is filled with compassion.

sub=Saṅkīrtana-phobia

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes devotees are afraid to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Even experienced <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are sometimes afraid to go out. Where does this fear come from?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Fear comes from <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em> sees that you are going to go out with Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and destroy her influence. Therefore she subtly attacks you and creates fear to stop you. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What if one lacks the patience to struggle on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and thinks it's better to stay in the temple where it's peaceful?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami</strong>: You may think that you will avoid problems by staying in the temple, but Kṛṣṇa arranges for problems to arise in the temple, so that you will realize that it is better to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. You will realize that although there are problems on the street, by distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, the greatest welfare activity for all the people of this world, you are getting purified faster.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> But on the altar the mind seems calmer than on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> On the altar your mind might be calm to begin with, but once you have gotten used to it, the mind starts saying, “Hey, why don't you do something else? You are meant for bigger things than waving this incense.” The mind is an expert rascal. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Doesn't <em>māyā</em> attack one more out on the street?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> No. I have seen that <em>māyā</em> attacks equally everywhere, but it is good to know that on the street Kṛṣṇa offers you more protection.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> If a devotee says, “I don't like to go out because I have only bad experiences on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>," what should we do? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If someone says that he doesn't like <em>saṅkīrtana</em> because he has only bad experiences, then <em>māyā</em> has already succeeded in capturing him. You should preach to him, saying, “No matter what you do in this world, you will have bad experiences because of your <em>karma</em>. Bad experiences on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> are also because of your <em>karma</em> and not because of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> will bring you blissful experiences. Sometimes it seems bad, but when you see 'good' and 'bad' in your service, whatever your service may be, you are still on the material platform. You have to transcend the material platform and come to the spiritual platform, because on the spiritual platform, one sees the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, in whatever form, as wonderful."

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Why does it seem so difficult in recent years to get new devotees for book distribution?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It is difficult because people are degrading. Most people are <em>śūdras</em> who think that anyone can distribute books. However, it has been proven throughout the years that only the highest class of men can distribute books. Although <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees may not be the most technically advanced or the greatest scholars, they know much more philosophy, and temple devotees may get involved in a scandal, but book distributors are rarely touched by scandals because they are always preaching. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some people avoid <em>saṅkīrtana</em> by saying that everything is <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Śrīla Prabhupāda didn't say that everything is <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. He is not a Māyāvādi. He made a distinction between two forms of service: <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> support. For example, those who feed the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are supporting, and although they are a part of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, they are not doing the same service as the front line preachers. Although everyone is appreciated, we make distinctions: the front-line warriors risking their lives in battle get medals, and behind-the-line supporters get a pat on the back.

sub=Capacity

<strong>Devotee:</strong> We can understand that we are not distributing these books, but Kṛṣṇa is. Is there…?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Is it His fault when you don't do so well one day?

<strong>Devotee:</strong> No.

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Then it's not just Kṛṣṇa distributing these books. If Kṛṣṇa were distributing these books, then what would He need you for? Do you think He needs you? Kṛṣṇa doesn't need you. By His mercy, He is allowing you to be His agent and distribute the books.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Why do some people distribute more books than others?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> They distribute more because they are better agents. When you understand the basis, the question is easy to answer. But if you speculate that Kṛṣṇa is distributing the books, then it doesn't make sense. How could Kṛṣṇa distribute sometimes more and sometimes fewer books? He would always do the same amount. But that is absurd. Some people are simply better agents than others, and those who are better agents distribute more books.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> One book distributor might do two hundred books a week and another five hundred. If both are giving everything to Kṛṣṇa, they are giving equally, but their capacities are different. What does "capacity” consist of? Is it material or spiritual? We know that Kṛṣṇa gives according to our desires. How does this apply to our specific capacities to preach? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Our capacity to work for Kṛṣṇa depends on both spiritual and material qualities. Someone materially qualified has a greater capacity to work. Yet someone else who is not materially qualified but more spiritually qualified may be able to do more than the materially adept but spiritually bankrupt person.

Take cooking, for example. A spiritually advanced person who has no interest in eating should not be able to cook a good tasting preparation based on material calculations, the material qualification being the desire to eat, because he has no relationship with the end product. As Śrīla Prabhupāda put it, “He who likes to eat can cook.” Thus both material and spiritual qualifications work together simultaneously to mold the devotee. In other words, capacity means a composite of spiritual and material qualifications. A book distributor materially qualified to communicate with people would have a better chance of distributing books well than one who is aloof.

The perfect example is Kṛṣṇa's choosing Arjuna to fight the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa did not use a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or <em>śūdra</em> to do the work. He used a first-class <em>kṣatriya</em> warrior. Yet the material qualification was tempered by the spiritual qualification of full surrender. Kṛṣṇa could have also used Karṇa, for example, but He did not, because Karṇa was not a devotee of the Lord. Kṛṣṇa will use the surrendered soul who has some capacity to work for Him in the manner He desires. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> A devotee will have a certain capacity to do his service. Is it possible for this devotee to get a bigger result, for example, in book distribution, or is he not surrendering completely right now? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> We expect from everyone whatever one can do. If you can do three hundred books a week and someone else can do seven hundred, then we expect three hundred and seven hundred respectively. Can everybody cook the same ecstatic feast? Not everyone is the same. Even if everybody were to have the same spirit, the result would still not be the same. Maybe you are surrendering fully, but someone else may be an expert in the art of controlling people. Still it is not only an art; <em>śakti</em> is needed as well. It cannot be picked up out of the air or learned at the chalk board. There are also other factors, such as austerity and previous lives. We simply expect the best you can do, and to try your best is purity. If three hundred books is as much as you can do, and seven hundred books is as much as he can do, then equal! In the example of Hanumān and the spider, Lord Rāmacandra accepted both equally, because both gave the best they had.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes devotees disagree about the example of Hanumān and the spider because their bodies were different sizes, but we have bodies that are all the same. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> All the same? If you and Harināmānanda dāsa stand next to each other, you both have human bodies but you are not the same. You both have different histories of billions of lifetimes.

sub=Saṅkīrtana Is Transcendental

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some devotees say that book distribution is brahminical and some say that it isn't. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> In one room conversation, Śrīla Prabhupāda called selling books a <em>vaiśya</em> activity. At other times he said that it is brahminical because it is teaching. It depends on how you do it. You have a <em>vaiśya</em> mentality if you say, “I am collecting for the ants in Mesopotamia,” because you are using deception to get some money and then throwing a book at him. But distributing books the way you are supposed to, by straight preaching, is brahminical. You show him the book in your hand and present it on the basis of what the book says and explain why the book is good to read. Of course, Prabhupāda said "by hook or by crook,” which implies that you can also do it with a <em>vaiśya</em> mentality. But if you are strong enough, you can sell the book on its merits by speaking philosophically to the people. Selling the books on the basis of the books is brahminical, and doing it to make money may indicate a <em>vaiśya</em> mentality, but book distribution itself is purely a Vaiṣṇava activity. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Which is better, to remain a simple book distributor one's whole life or to get brahminical initiation and a high post? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> First, it is not that you either distribute books or you get <em>brāhmaṇa</em> initiation; the book distributors are the <em>brāhmaṇas</em>, and we give them <em>brāhmaṇa</em> initiation. Second, the book distributors are in the highest position; there is no post higher than distributing books.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How is book distribution related to <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em>?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Book distribution itself has little to do with <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em>. For example, <em>brāhmaṇas</em> would never sell anything, and <em>vaiśyas</em> would never distribute Vedic literature. It cannot be classified according to any <em>varṇa</em>, but if it had to be classified, it would be brahminical (an insult, though not a big one). Book distribution is pure, transcendental activity. Everyone talks about transcending the modes of nature; nothing is more transcendental than distributing books, and everything else is questionable. By the distribution of these books, people will understand that their speculations are resulting in a chaotic society and that they need <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em> to properly organize society.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is it required to have a <em>kṣatriya</em> spirit to have enough courage and determination to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and do battle with <em>māyā</em>? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> First, you don't need a <em>kṣatriya</em> mood to have courage and determination; second, it is not the same kind of battle as in a war; and third, the great distributors say that the most important quality is complete dedication to the spiritual master's mission and the other qualities follow automatically. To give a gross example: a hungry person, even a young baby, knows exactly where and how to put food into the mouth. He doesn't have to think about it. Similarly, if you do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with complete dedication to the lotus feet of your spiritual master and constantly meditate on distributing the books for his pleasure, you will automatically get the necessary determination and intelligence to present the books correctly. There will be no weakheartedness. You will dash right onto the battlefield, weapons in hand. With this dedication and daily meditation you will succeed. By praying, before the Deities or within the heart, “Please Kṛṣṇa, help me in this mission. Please, help me satisfy my spiritual master,” you will get the mercy and all good qualities will develop within you. This I have heard from great authorities.

sub=Becoming Steady

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How can we become steady on book distribution?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The goal of every devotee in the movement, whether he is distributing books or not, is to become steady in his service. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted the devotees to be steady, so that they could become experts and have good results in their services. If you are always changing your service, you will not learn anything properly. Imagine having different cooks every day. No one would ever learn how to cook <em>prasādam</em>, and you would never be satisfied. The preaching department especially requires steadiness because preaching is so difficult, and of all the different types of preaching, book distribution requires the most steadiness. You must wait years before you become an expert. First you must meet many different kinds of people in many different circumstances, and then you must go on for the rest of your life, learning the art of surrender, which doesn't come cheaply. Every day you have to wake up and surrender. Therefore, steadiness is the most important quality of a devotee. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Will the results increase just by being steady? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Oh, are you worrying about your results? 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Not so much worried, but if the goal is to distribute as many books as one can… 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, distribute as much as you can, but when you start worrying about results, thinking that you should be number one, you are getting into trouble. Distribute out of love for the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, without expectation of results. If they want, they can cause you to do seventy books a day, or if they want, they can cause you to do seven books a day. Become a tool in the hands of Kṛṣṇa, and do not consider whether you are going to distribute a lot or not. Every day you should think, “Let's see what Kṛṣṇa arranges today. Maybe Kṛṣṇa will arrange for me to meet nice people, or maybe for my purification, He will arrange that I meet nasty people. Let us see what Kṛṣṇa has in store for me today.”

You are not a fruitive actor. Kṛṣṇa says in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>: <em>karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana</em>. You have a right to perform your <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service, but you don't have a right to enjoy the results of your service. Leave the results up to Kṛṣṇa and don't be attached to not doing your service. Of course, if you are never doing very much, that's also not good. That means something is wrong in the surrendering department. But don't give up, thinking that you cannot do very much anyway. You should go on and try to improve, but you should not be attached to the results. One attached to the results can only go on for a short time, maybe a year or two. If you are attached to the results, and the results and your expectation do not match, you will become discouraged, your results will dwindle even more, and you will fall down from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes authorities push one to be fruitive. One hears, “Oh, how many are you going to do today?" If one isn't doing a steady amount of books in a year, they consider him to be in <em>māyā</em>. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The temple has economic requirements, and your responsibility to the temple is to try to do as much as you can. Becoming free from the fruits of your results doesn't mean that you become irresponsible. As long as the authorities are pushing, you should try to do your service up to standard.

I personally never push the book distributors to fulfill quotas. Transcendental competitions are better. The distributors do not compete for sense gratification or glorification, and they surrender to the service and distribute as much as they can to please Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master.

Since the authorities have opinions on how much you should do, you can tell them, “I'll try my best to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and not be a disturbance to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, but the results are up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not me. Let's see what happens.” I think they will accept that. After all, it is the duty of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees to pass on to the authorities and others their realizations on how to work without fruitive results. Only the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees can understand that art well, because every day they have to meet good and rotten people on the street and be completely detached from how many books they are going to distribute.

If you distribute completely free from fruitive desires and your heart's only desire is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, then the books will start flying out of your hands, because you are not distributing anymore, Kṛṣṇa is. As long as you think that you are distributing the books, you are going to have a hard time. People will push you down, spit on you, or slap you in the face—and unless you are free from fruitive desires, you will fall apart.

If you want the books to go out of your hands in a transcendental way, you have to understand that it is all up to Kṛṣṇa and become a tool of the Supreme Lord. But that doesn't mean you have nothing to do with it. Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: <em>mayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam eva nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin</em>. Kṛṣṇa called Arjuna “Savyasācī,” or one expert in shooting arrows. He said, “By My arrangement, these men are already put to death, so you can become but an instrument in the fight, O Savyasācī.” Although Kṛṣṇa used Arjuna's expertise to do a service in which the result was already fixed, that didn't mean Arjuna had nothing to do with it. He did, but his service was to be Kṛṣṇa's tool. As Kṛṣṇa's tool, you should do your best, but let Kṛṣṇa use you. That is the secret of success. You have the ability to distribute a book, so let Kṛṣṇa use your abilities as if you were an instrument in His hands.

Becoming the tool of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult because the false ego is always telling us, “You are great. You are an important personality. You are going to distribute these books. You. You. You.” Others may drag you into this bodily conception of life too: "How many did you do today? You are really great!” A sure way to fall into <em>māyā</em> is to start believing what they say, instead of remembering that you are just a tool, an agency through which Lord Caitanya's mercy can work to distribute these books to the fallen souls and nothing more. You should never want to be anything more, because that's already the most exalted position in the universe. Arjuna was Kṛṣṇa's tool, and look what happened! He became the most exalted personality in all three worlds by destroying his opponents on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra; he is glorified to this day, five thousand years later. Similarly, you too can attain perfection in your service by becoming Kṛṣṇa's tool. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How do we become Kṛṣṇa's tool and go beyond the platform of false ego? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Becoming Kṛṣṇa's tool is not a "how can we” formula: “Take three cups of this, four cups of that, shake it well, and you become Kṛṣṇa's tool.” You have to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. You have to give up the feeling that you are the doer and accept within your heart that although you try your best, Kṛṣṇa is responsible for the results. After a while, you will realize, “Kṛṣṇa is doing it. I have no problems. I just go out, and Kṛṣṇa makes things happen as He always does.” Then you will never want to feel anything other than the ecstatic feeling of being a tool of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

sub=Kṛṣṇa Helps in Many Ways

<strong>Devotee:</strong> On the weekend we had a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> meeting. Different devotees spoke on the theme, “I am not the doer; everything is dependent on Kṛṣṇa.” One devotee made the point that in the material world, the Supersoul is controlling everything, including the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee on the street, who mainly deals with the Supersoul.

But a devotee is not only dealing with the Supersoul. If we approach the Bhagavān feature of the Lord, then He will personally reciprocate, <em>ye yathā māṁ prapadyante</em>. Śrīla Prabhupāda also explains in the preface of <em>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, "The Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is already in charge of the maintenance of this creation by virtue of His plenary expansion, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, but this maintenance is not direct. However, when the Lord says that He takes charge of His pure devotee, He actually takes direct charge.”

Another devotee explained to me that Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravarti Ṭhākura's commentary on <em>Bhagavad-gītā 9.29</em> says that the first two lines relate to the Supersoul and the last two lines to Kṛṣṇa personally. Someone else said that the devotee doesn't carry the Supersoul in his heart, but Lord Caitanya Himself. So how far can we say that Kṛṣṇa personally takes charge? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> I think that all the comments made in your text are correct. The Supersoul is helping the devotee distribute books by telling the people to take them, Lord Caitanya is giving His mercy so that the people can take the books, and Kṛṣṇa is directly inspiring the devotee to distribute. All these forms of the Lord help the devotee in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

sub=Fruitive Desire

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is the desire to increase book distribution scores for the pleasure of the spiritual master a fruitive desire? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The desire to satisfy the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa is a good desire, and to want to do it by distributing more books is also a good desire. You should always think, “I want to do more for their satisfaction,” but never be satisfied with the result. They are always asking you to do more. Śrīla Prabhupāda didn't say, “Just go out and do whatever you can.” He said, “Go out and double it.” This desire to double it is not fruitive, because it is a desire to please and satisfy the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. But if you want to do more so that you can come back and boast about how many books you have given out, then that desire is fruitive, because you are trying to be the enjoyer of the activity. You should pray to Kṛṣṇa to allow you to distribute many books for the satisfaction of your spiritual master. Then whatever you do will be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Although you may be a little frustrated that you cannot do more, you are pleasing the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa with your steady service, and you will get the mercy. It is not that the mercy only comes to one who does a thousand books a week. The mercy comes to everyone, whether one does a thousand books a week or a thousand books a month. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Can one safely say that unless one is free from fruitive desires, one cannot do large amounts of books? Sometimes somebody comes and does huge amounts of books and then suddenly goes away. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> One can do anything for a short time based on material energy, even distribute many books. But to continue having good results day in and day out for many years, one must be free from fruitive desire. A fruitive actor could not possibly maintain the service. Still a fruitive and attached person who does a lot in a short period will get some mercy. His wonderful service will be remembered in the future. In this lifetime or the next, he will get a good chance again and go back to Godhead.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Does one meet a lot of demons because one is fruitive? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It could just mean that there are a lot of demons in the world. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> But on some days, when one is somehow attached and is not in such a good state of consciousness, one meets nasty people. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> That's good, because if you met nice people in bad consciousness, you probably would waste the opportunity to give them a book or burn them out. Therefore, whenever you are in nasty consciousness, Kṛṣṇa sends you nasty people. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> In one lecture in Russia you said, "If you do a hundred books, then it's a hundred books. Whether you do it with good consciousness or not doesn't make any difference.” Could you please elaborate on that? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> On book distribution your consciousness is not the point. The point is that it is your service to get the books into the hands of the conditioned souls. Whether you feel good or bad about it is not the issue. To give out ten books and feel good is no big deal. Who cares whether you feel good or not? You are a preacher and a soldier. The soldiers on the battlefield may feel like hell, but that doesn't matter. The point is to go out and kill. The sergeant doesn't ask, “How do you feel today?" No, he says, “OK men, grab your guns. Let's go.” Similarly, the warriors on book distribution go out to distribute books, not to feel wonderful. However, if they keep going out, they naturally will feel blissful.

sub=Those Who Have Life Can Preach

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some book distributors begin to see their service as being the same every day. Why does one fall into such a mentality?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You fall into that mentality because every day on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> you are doing the same thing. You get up, chant your rounds, chant some <em>mantras</em>, eat some <em>prasādam</em>, pick up the books, put them in the bag, count them out, walk out the door, meet somebody, and say, “Hello.” So it is easy to fall into a rut and start to think that you are doing the same thing if you are not meditating on what you are doing and why you are doing it. As you are chanting your rounds, you can meditate on how you are distributing these books to please your spiritual master. Pleasing the spiritual master does not become routine. You will get a taste in spiritual life, begin to feel ecstatic within, and transcend the feeling that your service is repetitive.

Do you feel that you are in a rut when you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa every day? No. You feel it giving you transcendental life and inspiration. Similarly, after a day of book distribution, you feel enlivened. But sleep drags you into the mode of ignorance and you begin the morning on the mundane platform, thinking, "Oh, another day, another book.” Therefore you have to meditate on how this transcendental book distribution is giving you the "life" that you need in spiritual life. Otherwise, you would probably be back in the temple looking for a wife. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> I no longer seem to have enough energy to stay out on the street as I could before. Is this just the mind deterring me from surrendering? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> This question is best answered by you, not by me, but I can give you a hint. When you are very tired, or when the body lacks energy due to bad health, the mind will represent the body and say, “Don't go out so long, you are too weak.” But sometimes the mind, on its own, without being influenced by the body, says, "Oh, what is the use of all this? Why go out anyway?” There is a difference between the two. In the first case you are thinking, “This is a wonderful service. I want to do it, but somehow I am not getting it together.” In the second case you are thinking, "What is the use? Who cares? I don't want to do it.” In this second case, it is only the mind. But if you are having trouble performing devotional service because the body is weak, you should do something about it. Find a good doctor, get some medicine, and take some rest. Then, after the result has come, go back to your service. If the body is broken down completely, the mind may argue in both of the above-mentioned ways and the cause may be hard to distinguish. A sincere devotee will try to go on with his service, but the other devotees may notice that he is unable to perform his service because of weakness, and they may demand that he take care of himself.

Once Maṇidhara Prabhu came into my room in Schloss Rettershof. He was just talking nonsense. I kept looking at him as if he were mad. Since I could not understand one word he was saying, I asked him, “Do you feel all right?" After much extracting of information, I found out that he was sick. Although he had a high fever for the past three weeks, he kept pushing himself to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, thinking it was <em>māyā</em> to stop. So I put him in jail. I forced him to go upstairs into a guest room and made him stay there. I locked the door and only opened it to supply him with <em>prasādam</em>. He begged, threatened, and pleaded with me to let him out, but I forced him to stay there until he got better. After that, he went out and did nicely.

sub=How Straightforward Should a Preacher Be?

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is the solution to problems with authorities, such as the police?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Problems on the street are usually either <em>māyā</em> trying to stop us or Kṛṣṇa testing our sincerity. Whatever the cause is, the solution is to increase our dependence on Kṛṣṇa and not get entangled with the material nature. In the mid-seventies the police in Germany were giving us trouble. We were trying to solve the problem by fighting legal battles, but things were not changing. I even arranged for the lawyer who had helped legalize book distribution in the United States airports to come to Germany. He made a thick book of plans on how to defeat the laws in Germany. I took one look at this book and knew that this was not the right way. Instead we just kept going and depended on Kṛṣṇa, and within two years, we had very little trouble with the police. The problems that had been an everyday occurrence were rarely experienced anymore. Still, that does not mean we should not try to legalize book distribution, because legalization makes distribution easier for the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

On the street you should be a perfect gentleman and not a disturbance. If you are pushy or if you try to cheat people, you will get bad reactions. For example, in the past some devotees used the "change-up" method. Once in 1976 or 1977, I was traveling from Germany and my plane had to make an emergency landing at the Chicago Airport. Since I was stranded there, I decided to take advantage of the situation. I had heard about some of the distribution methods being used in America, so I phoned up the president of the Chicago temple and asked him how I could find out what it was like to be "changed-up.” He told me to stand underneath the main departure and arrival board and look stupid. I disguised myself as an ordinary, spaced-out <em>karmī</em>, looking at the board. Within no time I got my wish fulfilled: a distributor girl approached me. As she tried to pin a flower on my shirt, she babbled some nonsense about collecting money for some cause. But I kept saying that I did not want to give her any money, so she asked me if I could change some small bills for a fifty-dollar-bill. Although the temple president had warned me that this would happen, I handed her a fifty-dollar-bill. She slowly gave back the change, one dollar here, five dollars there—until she got to about thirty dollars. Then she said, “Why don't we leave it at that, for charity?" and I said, “No, I don't want to give any charity.” Again, after another five dollars, she said, "Why don't we leave it at that?" and she started walking away, adding, “By the way, where are you from?” When I told her, “From the temple at Schloss Rettershof, Germany,” she gasped and froze in her tracks. “I'm Harikeśa Swami,” I said. "Give me back my fifty dollars.”

When I came back to Germany, I told the devotees that they should never, under any circumstances, cheat people. It is a horrible experience. We would rather distribute five hundred books less each week than make money by cheating. As soon as people realize that they have been cheated, they get angry and tell the police. They tell their friends and their family, and we become known as cheaters. Therefore we should distribute the books in a straightforward way, as gentlemen and ladies. Many points in our philosophy address topics that people are interested in. If we preach the philosophy directly, then problems with the police will gradually disappear. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some devotees present the books in a way that does not seem so honest. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Lies are not needed. Tell people about the book. By explaining the books from a social, political, scientific, or economic angle, you attract the people to these books. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Among the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees there are two opinions on how to distribute books. Some say that the people should be inspired to read the books and not feel cheated. Even if they don't take the book, they should be left with some sweet words. Others say that the most important thing is to just pump out the books, and it doesn't matter what people might think afterward. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> I personally would prefer that you present the books nicely and encourage the people to read them, which comes naturally when you present the books philosophically. We do not condemn giving out the books using a <em>mantra</em>, without caring what happens, but that kind of book distribution is not the best. It is better to have the people walk away thinking, “That was a nice person. Let me try to read this book." 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> The problem is the devotees think that if they present the books nicely, they cannot distribute so much, because it takes a little more time. It's also a different mood. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, it's more brahminical. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> People who have met an unfriendly devotee are often fried out. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The problem is that in big countries like Germany there are so many people that you might think, "Well, it doesn't matter if I fry out a couple hundred thousand people.” But in Switzerland there are not so many people, and the devotees have to present the books nicely. Therefore the people in Switzerland take sets of books, read the books, and approach the devotees to thank them for the books. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Not only do we preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but we also try to get <em>lakṣmī</em>. You mentioned that those in management positions sometimes have to be a little duplicitous, but that a preacher, a <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, should always be completely straightforward. Should we be completely “up front” when trying to get donations for books? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> “Up front” does not mean stupid. In a place where the people do not like Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, you do not pull off your hat, show your bald head, and shout, “I am a Hare Kṛṣṇa devotee! I have come to take <em>lakṣmi</em> from you! Please give it here!” They will throw you out the door. However, if you tell the people, “I'm trying to spread love of God” or “I'm trying to do something beneficial for human society," then you are following the brahminical principle, <em>satyaṁ bruyāt priyaṁ bruyāt</em>: “Truth should be spoken palatably, and unpalatable truth should not be spoken.” A person who cannot take Kṛṣṇa directly has to be given Kṛṣṇa in another way. You can give Kṛṣṇa consciousness in many ways. If you have a little expertise, you will not disturb the person. The point is to give him a book. If you tell him something about Kṛṣṇa and he says, “Kṛṣṇa, forget it!" and doesn't take a book, then you have ruined his opportunity. It's your duty to make a palatable presentation, so that he will take the book. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Maybe sometimes one has to admit that he is a Hare Kṛṣṇa. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You can do that. We are not afraid of admitting it. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How can one develop enough faith in the book to preach directly about the book or about Kṛṣṇa and His qualities? For example, one may be afraid of the directness of the cover of the book, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If you read and appreciate the books, you will have faith in them. When you have faith in the books, you can impart that faith to others. There were times when the devotees in Germany were also having negative feelings. In 1976, I printed one hundred thousand <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books. Although that is not a big number nowadays, at the time it was the biggest printing run ever done. Printings had been usually about five thousand books, and I printed one hundred thousand.

The devotees were coming to me shaking in their boots: “It says on the cover, <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead</em>. How can we distribute these books?" So I made fun of them. I said that when they handed the book to someone, they would try to cover up the title with their thumb, because they would not want anyone to see that it says "Kṛṣṇa" on the cover. When you are paranoid and you think it is bad, the person on the street will immediately sense that something is wrong and not take the book. But the same person will react differently when you are not hung up about the title and you go out with full faith, thinking, "This is a book about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whoever reads this book will like it.” The German devotees had not been distributing many books, and all of a sudden they increased. After a week or two of preaching, our <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees sold all one hundred thousand <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books in a month or so. The change was due to the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books alone. The devotees just went out and distributed like crazy, running around all day in complete ecstasy selling <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books.

You can tell people that the books contain stories from the Vedic literature about wonderful personalities from the past, stories that their children will also like. You have to have a positive attitude and put the book into the people's hands. Then, although they read, <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead</em>, they will not think anything bad about it. Everything depends on your consciousness. Always think positively about these books, and that will rub off on the person you are distributing to. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> When we distribute books we often present them as yoga, meditation, or Indian culture. After some time we meet the same people again, and sometimes they are disappointed, because they found out from the first page that the book is about God and religion. How can we avoid disappointing the people in this way? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If you say “spiritual culture," "spiritual philosophy," or "spiritual knowledge,” they will not feel cheated, because you tell them “spiritual” right away. Our books are not religious. You should not use the word “religious.” You should use "spiritual” or “transcendental.” Then they cannot say you didn't tell them. You can say, “Of course the books are spiritual. Spirit comes from the Supreme Spirit in the spiritual world.” 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is it OK to say that we are students? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, we are students. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> A <em>karmi</em> thinks that "students” means university students, which we are not; therefore they feel a little cheated. Would it be better to say monks or nuns? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> What is a monk? You can tell them, “We are <em>sādhus</em>." I used to distribute books in a way that you might consider strange. I presented Kṛṣṇa consciousness directly. People would just become hypnotized by what I was saying and take the book. Of course, we were only distributing the small paperback <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books for a dollar. When I got bored with repeating the same words, I would say, “We are <em>sādhus</em>,” or, “We are the <em>taṭastha-śakti</em> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Amazingly, nobody objected. I sold the most on days when I was running from person to person, throwing books into their arms. People would buy them, but I don't know how. If someone asks me how I distributed books, I cannot precisely remember. Sometimes I used to say, “These books are fantastic. If you don't have any other book but this one, your life will be perfect. Just take it," and it would work.

Distributing books often has nothing to do with what you say but who you are. You can say exactly what a devotee who can distribute many books says, but when you say it the effect will be different. It is a question of personality. Some devotees have a personality that the people like, so they buy a book. The most important thing is to be natural. You should be well dressed, but don't try to put on an artificial show of who you are, who you think you are, or who you want the people to think you are. Just be yourself and be friendly. By being a friendly devotee, people will be attracted to you.

sub=Awakening Desire

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes people are not interested in the subject matter of the books. How is it possible to awaken their desire to take a book? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You have to awaken their desire little by little. For example, you can talk to them about specific problems in the material world. People like to talk about the ignorance that causes disturbances to the environment or problems such as wars and disasters. There are so many things you can talk about; it just takes practice to choose the right topic. Whether the person relates to these problems is not so important; the point is to lure him into a discussion and gradually swing the focus to the book. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How does one deal with people who have heard negative news reports or propaganda about Kṛṣṇa consciousness? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Śrīla Prabhupāda said that any publicity is ultimately good. The people may have heard something that seems bad on the news, but when they see a devotee with a book, and he looks good and is friendly to them, they may remember that they heard something on the news, but it is no longer important. They may not even remember what they heard, and even if they do, you can change a negative impression into a positive one by being a friendly person. You should not worry too much about what people have heard on the news; meditating too much about such things will undermine your faith. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes one meets friendly people who do not want to take any books. Is it bad to feel sad and lament about this?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> A devotee laments when people don't take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but he doesn't lament for long. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> But why should it go on like that? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The people do not take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness because they are in <em>māyā</em>, and it is our duty to try to get them out of <em>māyā</em>. Therefore you should think it unfortunate when you are not successful in bringing people out of <em>māyā</em>, but you should immediately snap out of your lamentation and move on, because to just stay there and feel sorry for yourself is sense gratification.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> We meet many people who have gotten Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and have tried to read them, but they could not understand a single word. Can you explain how they will be benefited?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Those persons are glorious, because they have tried to read the books. Even if they didn't understand anything, still they are purified. They may remain dull and foolish in this lifetime, but in the next lifetime they will get another chance to study <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> or <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> with more facility. You have given them the greatest help—long-range help—and you should never feel that they are not benefited. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> If people don't understand what they are reading, how will the books change society?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Only the grossest people do not understand what they read. Change will develop gradually. The books will be handed down to the younger generation, who will understand what they read, and who will be able to change. We just keep distributing the books. We don't know who is going to read them or what is going to happen. Maybe the person who buys the book cannot understand anything he reads, but then he dies and his son becomes attracted and reads the book.

The books travel all over the world. Devotees have joined in Germany or Scandinavia because of books they have received in Los Angeles or Chicago. These books are acting, but the change in society will take time. We should keep on pushing forward, and then one day, because of all these books, this huge cement structure created by the materialists, this big castle in the sky, will crack; as the Chinese proverb says, "Little drops of water on the rock make a big hole.”

sub=Dealing with Demons

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> one may be preaching to a nonsense. How can one avoid losing one's temper and blaspheming him? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You have to understand what you are doing on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Your purpose is not to defeat the opposing party. Your purpose is to get a book into the hand of the person you are talking to. If you think that the person is a nonsense and there is no question of him taking a book, you should quickly move on to the next person. You don't get involved in trying to defeat him. What is the use of trying to fight with someone on the street? You will only get agitated and fall into the mode of passion. Then, because you are disturbed, you will not be able to distribute anything to the next person. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What should we do when demons harass us? Sometimes they even follow us if we change to another place. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It's up to you. If you are a big guy, you might smash him in the nose — ultimately that is what a demon understands. But then you will get into trouble with the police, because he will go to them and complain. Or you can just threaten to hit him in the nose. Maṇidhara Prabhu was expert at dealing with demons. Sometimes he would fall down on the ground, take hold of their feet, and beg them to go somewhere else. He made them so amazed and embarrassed that they would do as he asked.

sub=Practical Questions

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Since devotees also want to distribute longer on Ekādaśī during the marathon, is it OK to then chant only sixteen rounds instead of twenty-five? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Śrīla Prabhupāda once said that if you are on marathon or something similar, it is all right to chant only sixteen rounds on Ekādaśī, because sixteen rounds is the standard he originally established. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is it better to distribute books in Vaiṣṇava dress or in <em>karmi</em> clothes? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Distributing in Vaiṣṇava clothes is good because people will understand what they are getting, but you can wear nondevotional clothes if it helps you get a better result. Śrīla Prabhupāda approved both methods. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> To what degree should the devotees use materialistic sales techniques, such as wearing a suit and tie, in dealing with the public?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You should not be artificial. Wouldn't it be artificial to put yourself in a suit? You would feel like a penguin. You can try it and see what happens. If you predominantly approach older people, then they will think, “Oh, he is nicely dressed; let me hear what he has to say.” But we would like to get the books to the younger people, and they would think that you are weird. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> While distributing books, can we ask for donations to maintain ourselves and our families? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It depends on what you say. You cannot ask for a donation for food relief or for the temple and use it for yourself. Then you are cheating and you will get into trouble spiritually, and it will also get the movement in trouble. It is more acceptable to tell people frankly, "I'm a monk, and I have no means of support, so any donation that you could give would help me.” Asking for extra donations for your personal maintenance is not required. It disturbs the people, and it doesn't mix together with book distribution. By selling books you will automatically maintain yourself.

To maintain your family by distributing books is wonderful. The temple managers should help householders to maintain their families by book distribution. If they were living in the temple, the temple would have to maintain them. To spare themselves this unwanted expense, the temple authorities should be liberal enough to give the householders enough of a percentage of the profit to maintain their families by book distribution. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted the householders to support themselves by distributing books and running restaurants. I take on my head the dust of the feet of any householder supporting himself by distributing books.

sub=Saṅkīrtana for Life

<strong>Devotee:</strong> You always speak about the ecstasy of book distribution, but I don't experience this ecstasy when I go out. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You must taste something, otherwise how could you keep going out day after day as you are doing? Maybe the ecstasy does not pick you up and throw you down on the street, but it is a soft ecstasy that inspires you to continue distributing books. It is not an ecstasy that causes you to scream, pull out your hair, and go mad, but it is a subtle experience of satisfaction.

In the material world there is no such experience of ecstasy. There is only black or white. When materialists get together, they go from laughing hysterically one minute to complete dejection the next. But devotees are always on a steady platform of bliss. Steadiness is the beginning stage of transcendental ecstasy. This steadiness will eventually lead you to <em>bhāva</em> and then to <em>prema</em>. One day, in the middle of a <em>kīrtana</em>, you will realize that you are not your body but a spirit soul. You will chant in ecstasy, jump in the air, twirl around, and chant, “Hari bol!” When you experience that great ecstasy and you are enlivened in transcendental realization, run into my room and touch me on the head and bless me, so that I can taste the ecstasy too. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is fanaticism? What does it mean to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> fanatic? Is it good to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> fanatic? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Fanaticism is doing something blindly without any knowledge or concern for what other people think.

Book distribution is not fanaticism, and book distribution fanatics are not fanatics. They simply want to distribute books and nothing else. They are the most intelligent people, because they have dedicated their lives one hundred percent to the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Therefore we lovingly refer to them as fanatics. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What special qualities does one need to distribute books for the rest of one's life? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If you simply want to distribute books for the rest of your life, all the qualities that you need will come automatically. You may not be on the street forever. You might be inspiring and assisting others to distribute more; you might be making more new distributors. Thus your whole life would be devoted to book distribution. I personally wouldn't mind if everybody were just distributing books; I would go from one traveling party to another and have an enormously good time. But we also have to publish books, and publishing books demands time and energy. Other problems, such as family life and big temples, also demand time and energy. There has to be a place for everyone in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because not everyone will go out and distribute books. But from our point of view, we would love it if there was only book distribution. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What will happen to book distribution in the future, when everybody already has all the books? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> In the future we will also distribute books. We will distribute until everyone in the world has a full set of books. Then we will start to distribute spare sets, in case they lose the books or their dog eats them. Unlimited amounts of books can be distributed. Don't think that soon everybody will have books; it will take at least a hundred years. And besides, books don't last forever, so we have to distribute new ones too. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What will we do when everyone in the world has a <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> What a terrible problem! You will go to every door and teach the people what it says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. You will give them <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, and when they all have <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, you will give them the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>. When everyone is finished reading the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, we will have a billion-person <em>kīrtana</em> and this earth planet will float right out of the universe.

chapter=8

title=The Effects of Saṅkīrtana

sub=Fulfilling Kṛṣṇa's Plan

Kṛṣṇa always has a plan for the ultimate good of the living entities, and the devotee assists in fulfilling His plan by becoming His tool or instrument. Some may consider this difficult, but whatever Kṛṣṇa desires can be accomplished; we only have to understand how to do it, and Śrīla Prabhupāda has given us the means to do it. Śrīla Prabhupāda's program is for all of us, and with the process he has given, we will satisfy Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is satisfied, why would we need to come up with anything else? Therefore, we engage in the publication and distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books throughout the world, because this will satisfy Kṛṣṇa. It is the perfect way in which Kṛṣṇa's plan may manifest. This literature is eternal, and our business is to somehow or other get these books in the hands of everyone in the human form of life, regardless of their language.

sub=Lord Caitanya's Prediction

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that for ten thousand years there will be a rapid increase in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and for two thousand years it will be like Satya-yuga. Golden ages do not just come because they have been predicted. It is not that everybody will be hellish rascals—living like hogs, dogs, camels, and asses, eating stool and liking it—and then all of a sudden, because of some astrological influences, “boom” comes the Golden Age and everybody is in Satya-yuga. It doesn't happen like that. It will happen when Lord Caitanya's mercy is manifested throughout the world. Everybody has to get the mercy. Therefore we are distributing these books like mad; otherwise, there is no question of the Golden Age starting.

Some of Śrīla Prabhupāda's Godbrothers thought that Lord Caitanya's prediction, <em>pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma, sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma</em>, “In every town and village throughout the world the holy name will be heard,” was an impossible dream or a mystical theory. But when the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> was resounding in all towns and villages throughout the world, they praised Prabhupāda for making what seemed to have been a myth into fact.

We should not fall into the trap of doubting that a golden age of Kṛṣṇa consciousness will come. We should know for sure that by distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, Lord Caitanya's prediction will be fulfilled. Ultimately everything comes from distributing these books.

An increasing number of intelligent people will get Prabhupāda's books. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted his books read by people with intellectual capacity; therefore he started the library parties and college preaching programs. Intelligent persons will realize how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa by reading Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, or they will be forced to surrender by the material nature. Then they will join our movement, and if they do not join immediately, they will soon begin to subtly act in a Kṛṣṇa conscious way. Wherever Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are being distributed in mass numbers, we discover people who have been reading them for years but not saying anything. Sometimes these people hold influential positions within the society—many politicians already have Prabhupāda's books, and many of them believe what they read and start saying and doing amazing things.

Many people are reading the books. Books are handed out in airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, or Honolulu, and then they are taken to far-off corners of the world. From the most outrageous places, people write us letters, saying that they are so impressed with these books that they want a catalog.

sub=Kṛṣṇa's Propaganda Network

Every house is being infiltrated by Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. They sit on the shelf, emitting a shining effulgence and emanating spiritual ecstasy and little vibrations of piety. It is like having a Deity. One day, the people will become attracted. Their hand will go across the bookshelf and somehow reach out for the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, though they think that the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is not the book that they want. They think that they want some book about sex, drinking, and crime, yet they pull out the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> and start to read it. And they know, "Oh, no, I'm reading about God! It will ruin my life.” But it is so attractive that they have to keep on reading. As the attractive potency of these books gradually forces people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, they find that their lives become perfect. They find everything that they were missing: happiness, ecstasy, energy, enthusiasm. Everything that was taken away from them by the demoniac elements of society, they get back a hundredfold.

When they met a devotee, took a book, and gave a donation, they didn't think much about it. It was a short experience that maybe only took five minutes; the person was friendly, but one meets many friendly people in this world. But by taking the book home, putting it on the shelf, and reading it, their life changed.

We may think that because we meet so many people during the day, for a person to receive Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is a common occurrence. But actually it is the most profound experience in that person's life; it is the most important thing that he has ever done in 8,400,000 lifetimes.

Distribution of this literature changes people's lives. People are being influenced by a few big demons in this world through their propaganda network—the TV, the radio, and the newspapers. Yet Kṛṣṇa has His propaganda network and Prabhupāda has written all the propaganda. And we are the propagandists, eager to distribute books in every language of the world. We want people to understand that volumes of literature have been written about Kṛṣṇa and our relationship with Him. If people hear about Kṛṣṇa, then their lives will become perfect.

Therefore we should distribute with earnestness. We should understand that people in the world today have little hope. This world is coming to a crushing conclusion. Disturbances are everywhere. The situation bewilders people. Yet we offer an alternative. We can help people become free from the ravages of material nature by distributing millions of books. We should not be satisfied with a marathon that lasts only a week. We should want to make the marathon last our entire lives. Instead of thinking that we will do it for a certain amount of time and afterward enjoy, we should realize that this human form of life doesn't last long-maybe it will last fifty or sixty years or maybe only five more minutes—and make our lives a marathon, producing and distributing books to bring people back home, back to Godhead.

sub=These Books Stop Wars

Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on <em>tapo divyam</em>, transcendental austerity. To go out and preach, moving from place to place as saṅkīrtaners do, is an austerity. To stay in a different place every night is uncomfortable—the situation is unfamiliar, and one has to struggle to accomplish even the smallest thing. We understand how difficult it is, for we have also traveled nonstop for many years. Still a devotee prefers to move around and preach, because this austerity keeps one strong and detached from the material world.

The austerity of distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books to people who think they don't want them is an austerity that purifies the distributor, the person he meets, and the entire area. Although the people's <em>karma</em> dictates that they should suffer, they are only getting a little taste of their prescribed <em>karma</em> because of this transcendental <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. That is not to say that it will not get worse, but were it not for book distribution, the suffering would already be so bad that you could not imagine it.

The performance of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> by distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books enables a country to become a more auspicious place. Śrīla Prabhupāda once said that the threat of war is imminent, but if we distribute these books in Russia and America, the threat of war will reduce considerably. That is exactly what happened. However, in places in which <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is not allowed or is forcibly stopped, the suffering condition increases. We might surmise that the only thing keeping the material world together right now is book distribution. Of course, others might contest and say that we are fanatics. Yet you still cannot deny the possibility that without book distribution the world situation would be disastrous, because Kali-yuga is such a degraded time.

Therefore we must perform this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> austerity. Happiness and suffering will come automatically anyway, so why should we endeavor for these things? Let us do the best for everyone, including ourselves, by engaging in transcendental austerity that will benefit the whole world.

sub=As the Material World Falls Apart

The effect that distributing tons of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books will have is beyond imagination. Although we may not perceive it immediately, as the conditions of life become worse, we will see people become more inclined to take shelter of Prabhupāda's books. Now they are in the illusion that they are happily situated, but troubles are coming. These foolish people will gradually come to understand that this material world is a frustrating place, and by taking shelter of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, they will be able to get free from all miserable conditions of life and go back home, back to Godhead.

We should consider every day of the year a marathon and try to please Śrīla Prabhupāda and Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi by always preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness and always increasing the distribution of these books. Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi are very merciful, spreading <em>saṅkīrtana</em> fever and blessing the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Everyone should take shelter of Their Lordships' lotus feet and try to expand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, so that more and more people can take shelter in it and, in turn, further spread the mercy of this movement throughout the world.

sub=A Systematic Attack on Māyā

One can only understand the Supreme when one follows in the footsteps of one who has achieved the Supreme. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement follows in Śrīla Prabhupāda's footsteps, because we know that he has obtained Kṛṣṇa and can give us Kṛṣṇa. That is why we study Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and distribute them to others. Even if we did nothing else, this book distribution alone would transform the world. <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> says that it is meant to spark off a revolution in the hearts of the people within a misdirected civilization.

We are launching a systematic attack on <em>māyā</em>, like termites go into wood, so that <em>māyā</em> cracks from within. When termites burrow into a piece of wood, they permeate everywhere, eating out little holes here and there throughout. Then one day somebody steps on the piece of wood and it cracks into pieces. Everyone is bewildered because the piece of wood looked so strong, but suddenly it was finished. And then they realize that the termites had been eating it all the time, but nobody knew, because they could not be seen. Thus all of our little Kṛṣṇa conscious termites can defeat the material energy and make the real revolution by going out and eating away at the <em>māyā</em> of this material world by distributing books.

sub=Double It and Break the Camel's Back

Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted us to double book distribution every year, because these books weigh heavy on the demons' shoulders and purify the land of contamination.

Once a cruel camel driver put load after load on the back of his camel, until the camel's legs were shaking under the load. Then the driver put on one more straw, and the camel collapsed to the ground. Thus in English we have a saying, “The straw that broke the camel's back.” This materialistic society is trying to keep itself together while books are being piled up on its back, and one day, one last book will make the whole materialistic society crash.

All the books that we have been distributing have to make a big dent in the roof of ignorance that the demons have covered the land with. This roof has blocked the wonderful ray of Kṛṣṇa from shining on the people. Because everyone under this roof is as useless as they are, the demons had thought that they were safe and that nobody would be capable of bringing God to them. But then Śrīla Prabhupāda came to America with his books, and since then, many books have been steadily going under the demons' roof and spreading everywhere—to every house, every corner, every street, every town. Soon, every house will have at least one set.

sub=Literature for Paramahaṁsas

Mundane literature has to be spiced up with sufficient sex life to make it sell. Consequently, when mundaners understand that Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are about spiritual life and are not filled with sex, violence, and other nasty things, they cannot understand how the books can possibly be good. But if you explain that these books are meant for the spiritual elevation of the human mind and consciousness, that human society's present situation is leading not to happiness but to frustration and suffering, and that the miseries of birth, death, old age, and disease are fixed realities, then they may become interested and buy a book.

Many people become interested and take our books. The expansion of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has given rise to a slight increase in interest for spiritual existence. People have some small understanding that the “scripture of the crows" is not going to get anyone very far. It merely will lead to rebirth and enjoyment of the crowlike pleasures of this material world. We pray to Kṛṣṇa that this small increase in spiritual awareness will increase and that people will welcome these books. These books are literature meant for the swanlike class of men. If all the devotees pray to Kṛṣṇa that the people of this world will develop the qualities of paramahaṁsas, interested not only in eating, sleeping, mating, and defending, but also in the swanlike activities of hearing and chanting the transcendental glories of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this world could become a wonderful place in which everybody is spiritually satisfied, like Vaikuṇṭha. Śrīla Prabhupāda did not write his books with some ideal intention of just selling a few books to a few interested people. He wanted these books distributed far and wide to all the people of this world, so that they can become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

sub=Valuable Gems

When we distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, we are distributing the perfect literature—the most valuable gems, the diamonds, of transcendental literature. Most people have never been educated to differentiate between a real diamond and some flashy glass. Thus, when they have been handed a book, they may or may not immediately appreciate its value, because they do not know what a diamond is. They cannot understand why anyone would give them something so wonderful, because they do not know about the deep mercy and compassion of the devotees, who go out and distribute these books just to save the fools and rascals. And because these fools lack sufficient intelligence, they sometimes foolishly become upset and throw books away. Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote in a letter to the German devotees, “In a madhouse, sometimes the patient is so crazy that he strikes the doctor. But the doctor has to be tolerant and understand that he must expect such behavior from a crazy man.” In this world many crazy or just plain dull people cannot understand a good thing, presented right before them. But it doesn't matter; we go out anyway with determination and distribute these books in great numbers. In this way, we will be able to gradually change many people's lives. These books will get into high places, and important people will start to read them, and gradually things will change in a very nice way. Have faith that these wonderful books are forcing <em>māyā</em> to loosen her stranglehold on human society and are weakening the results of Kali.

sub=If There Were a Proper King

Nowadays nobody performs sacrifices, because people have forgotten how to do it. But if there were a proper king, then he would keep the <em>brāhmaṇas</em> engaged in offering sacrifices for the sake of humanity. He would engage us, the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, in distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books throughout his kingdom. He would supply us with <em>saṅkīrtana</em> vans, buses, and places to stay in each village and town. He would arrange for accommodation facilities, parking spaces, and book storage warehouses. He would ask us to go door-to-door and supply us with the main positions on the streets. A law in his kingdom would state that every house must have a <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>.

Such a king would know that everyone in his kingdom would benefit from <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>. For example, on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> one performs <em>dānam</em>, the giving of charity. The book distributor gives in charity the greatest gift of transcendental literature, and the conditioned souls give in charity some of their wealth.

sub=The Visible Effects

Sometimes devotees, younger devotees especially, express doubts about the effectiveness of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. This is because they cannot see the effect directly, but they should understand that their coming to this movement is an effect. They are living proof of the effectiveness of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. And the effect is seen also in how many people come to the temples for the Sunday Feast every week.

The effects are also visible over a longer period of time. Twenty years ago nobody talked about vegetarianism. Universities did not offer vegetarian cooking courses. New York City had only two vegetarian restaurants. They were right next door to each other on St. Mark's Place, and they were frequented by only a few old beatniks and hippies. Talk about reincarnation was also never heard in public or in the media nor discussed in the schools. No one knew what the word <em>karma</em> meant. John Lennon made a song about karma, and everybody started wondering what it was and where he had heard about it.

Nowadays everybody knows what reincarnation and <em>karma</em> are. The United States of America alone has thousands of vegetarian restaurants—every city has one. Everybody talks about vegetarianism. Some people in England have formed a movement called the "Animal Liberation Front.” These people have taken up guerrilla warfare. They attack butcher shops and smash the windows. They poison meat to make people stop eating it. They go to vivisection laboratories for animal testing, rescuing the animals and destroying the laboratories. Fifteen or twenty years ago, such a movement was unheard of. Also many movies contain scenes or dialogue about reincarnation or karma, which the demons then try to disprove with their movies. A huge battle is going on in the world now between these two sides.

A conflict is even going on among the scientists. Many scientists are putting forward ideas that completely contradict the nonsensical orthodox scientific propaganda. Even the Christians are trying to make a revival, talking about creation as opposed to Darwinistic evolution. Who started all this? You may say what you like, but I will tell you that it is because of Prabhupāda's books. It is not because Maharishi or Rajneesh is preaching. The weight of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is being felt on this world, and every year the pressure becomes more intense. Fighting is going on in all levels of society. Vegetarians are fighting against nonvegetarians. Doctors are proclaiming, “Stop eating meat.” In America people are fighting about whether there should be prayer in school, and God was one of the biggest issues in their last presidential election. People are talking about morality and the family again instead of illicit sex. Abortion is being exposed as murder. Kṛṣṇa has so mercifully caused AIDS and herpes. People are having a revolution in consciousness, and it is coming from the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Previously, nobody was interested in these things, but now so many people are interested, and the demons are so interested in stopping it. In the beginning, we did not have many problems with the demons. We would be chanting on the streets, and maybe once a month a demon would try to give us trouble. But then book distribution started, and the demons came out of the walls, like rats attracted by cheese. And when we started to distribute many books, the demons became hysterical because they thought that they had killed God. “What? Books about God?” they said. “Destroy them!” And they started to make false accusations in an attempt to stop the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

This book distribution is wonderful because it splits society words in half. Book distribution forces the nice people to become nicer and the demons to become more demoniac. The demons are going after sense gratification in an outright demoniac fashion, and the devotionally-minded are moving toward a higher state of consciousness. We will go on flooding the world with Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, for the weight of his books will force a change—after the people read them and become enlightened in knowledge, they will insist on a positive transformation of society.

sub=“Crack” Goes This Rotten Civilization

No one is more glorious than a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee because he distributes Śrīla Prabhupāda's mercy, by which the world will never be the same again. I want to share with you a story that some social psychologists tell, because it is relevant to book distribution.

Some islands in the Pacific were inhabited by monkeys who dug up sweet potatoes, being the only food there for the monkeys to eat. But because they were not very smart, the monkeys were crunching on dirt along with the sweet potatoes, until one day, on one of the islands one monkey thought, "Why do I have to eat these potatoes with the crunchies? I'll bring them to the ocean, wash them off, and eat them without to the crunchies." From then on his sweet potatoes tasted wonderful, and the monkey shared them with his family members, who also started washing their sweet potatoes. Gradually, more and more monkeys on the island started washing their sweet potatoes. When ninety-five percent of the monkeys on the island started to wash their sweet potatoes, a monkey on a nearby island suddenly decided to wash his sweet potatoes in the ocean. Soon, when all the monkeys on that island were also washing their sweet potatoes, the monkeys on the next island also spontaneously started to wash their sweet potatoes. There was no communication between the islands, no monkey mail. Just because ninety-five percent of the monkeys on one island were doing it, all the monkeys on the next island started doing it, until all the monkeys in these islands of the Pacific were washing their sweet potatoes in the ocean.

Although this example is mundane, I was meditating on it because it has a direct link to our distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. We are distributing his books, and we are going to just keep on distributing his books, until the weight of these books on the human society will be so great that one country will suddenly crack and all the people in that country become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then the next country will crack, and the people will become Kṛṣṇa conscious. All countries around the world will become Kṛṣṇa conscious because of all the books out being distributed by the devotees. Just see how many books have suddenly been distributed in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. One year only a few books were going out underground, and the next year hundreds of thousands of books were going out publicly. How is it happening? It is happening because of the domino principle: all the dominoes are lined up next to each other. When you push over the first domino, it pushes over the second one, which pushes over the third, and so on, until all the dominoes fall over. Because we had been distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books throughout the world, the pressure on the Soviet Union was so great that it had to crack.

Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are being distributed by the hundreds, thousands, and millions throughout the year. We should have full, transcendental faith that this book distribution mission is going to make a big impact in this world. It is not even a question of how, where, when, or why. It will happen because Śrīla Prabhupāda said that it would happen. In 1977, he said that historians would look back on this time in history, the latter part of the twentieth century, and they would see the revolutionary seeds that were planted to change the face of this planet. We may not be able to see it, because sometimes we are fruitive. We think that unless everybody in the world is chanting in <em>kīrtana</em>, we haven't been a success. Nevertheless, it will come to pass. The people will have so many books constantly emanating Kṛṣṇa consciousness in their homes that every time someone walks by, he will be affected. At one point someone will pick up the book, read it, and change his life.

In this way we are gradually wearing down the defenses of this material civilization, so that the whole world is coming to know who Kṛṣṇa and Śrīla Prabhupāda are and what this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is all about. The people will have no other choice than to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. This rotten materialistic civilization will crumble, and a Kṛṣṇa conscious civilization will arise. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only solution. The materialists have tried everything else, but nothing else works. Therefore we should go on distributing as many books as we can. It doesn't matter if you are in first, second, or tenth place. All that matters is that you are in a place, distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books as much as you can. Nothing is more important than to go on steadily distributing books, so let us continue to give people Kṛṣṇa consciousness and make our lives successful. And at the end, we will all go back home, back to Godhead together.

chapter=9

title=The Topmost Preaching

sub=I'm a Fanatic

Śrīla Prabhupāda has told us what the prime benediction is, what we should do, and how we should act. He has stated clearly, “There is no more direct way to preach than to distribute Kṛṣṇa conscious books.” Therefore we have traveling preaching teams, who take piles of books and distribute them in every town and village, encouraging the people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Then when someone becomes very sincere, he joins Caitanya Mahāprabhu's <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party. Thus taking a book of Śrīla Prabhupāda's and putting it into the hand of a materialist is the topmost and most direct preaching.

In our classes over the years, we have explained the philosophy in many ways, but hopefully you have noticed an overriding theme in them. The only reason I don't just jump up and down all the time and scream, “Distribute books, distribute books, distribute books!" is because you would get bored. But that is how I feel. I am a fanatic! Maybe I don't look like a fanatic. I try to be fair. But actually I am a fanatic, and I have always been a fanatic. An uncontrollable madness wells up in me, and I have no other desire than to see millions of books distributed. I am also satisfied to see other projects developing—but only if the books are going out. Otherwise I cannot tolerate anything else. I support everybody in every service, but in my heart I only care about book distribution. I am sorry, because there are so many other programs that everybody else considers important, but the most important program is distributing books. Śrīla Prabhupāda once wrote to one devotee, "What is the use of your three minutes preaching? They will listen to you and say that you are very nice, but then they will go away and quickly forget everything you said. But if you give them a book, they will read it or at least somehow get benefited.”

sub=The Big Bang of Books

“A big bang of books was started by Śrīla Prabhupāda, and a change occurred within the universe. As the books scattered in all directions, by chance some of them landed in different homes, and by chance the people read them and became Kṛṣṇa conscious. Thus the world changed.”

But these occurrences were not directed by chance, in the same way that the universal creation was not a product of chance. It is not by chance that people take these books, read them, and go back home, back to Godhead. It is not by chance that billions and trillions of books will be distributed. It is the perfect arrangement of the Lord.

Sometimes devotees ask me, “Is it right that I set a quota and then pray to Kṛṣṇa to reach that quota, or should I just try to do as much as I can?” They do not want to demand a result from Kṛṣṇa. But whatever you consider your quota to be, Kṛṣṇa's quota for you is much higher. If you are only trying to do one-third of Kṛṣṇa's quota, what is the big deal if you are praying to Kṛṣṇa to help you. Kṛṣṇa's quota for you is 10,000 books a day! But you set a quota of twenty, fifty, or a hundred and are proud of your quota. You don't know that Kṛṣṇa wants everything from you. Whatever you think your quota is, you can multiply it by a hundred, and then you may be near to what Kṛṣṇa's quota is for you.

You have to surrender and give up all conceptions, such as, “I am the doer, the enjoyer, the knower, and the intelligent one. See how expert I am!" Your only purpose should be to perform the service that you have been given within this mission with full enthusiasm, dedication, devotion, and love.

We are an army, not a little bunch of people who have gotten together to have a party. We are marching against the demons! We don't like the demons, and we don't like their civilization. We don't want to have anything to do with their civilization. We want to crush their civilization. We are an army, we don't mess around, and we are not playing games. Our mission is to crush and destroy the demoniac civilization with books!

sub=It Is Possible

We are going to bomb the demons to death with books. Although the demons are bewildered about how it is happening, more and more people are getting Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. We will give out books to every house and corner. Lord Nityānanda cut a canal from the ocean of ecstasy, brought it to every door, and blew the houses down. Similarly, we are distributing ecstasy all over the world. And yet we are not satisfied. When was Śrīla Prabhupāda ever satisfied? When did he ever sit back and say, “Yes, my dear disciples, now you have done it. I am fully satisfied.” Never! He said, “More. Double it!” We thought, "Impossible,” but he said, "What is impossible? Double it means do twice as much."

We have to double it, otherwise there is no question of building the biggest building on the Asian continent. The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, which ten years ago was wearing one blue sock and one red sock, is now building the biggest building in Asia. Lord Nityānanda predicted it and Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura saw it. Still that does not mean “poof” and automatically the building will be there. We have to seriously and sincerely give up all material desires for our own sense gratification, run out the door like transcendental madmen, and distribute books all over the world.

Don't think that it is not possible to get so many books out. If you think that it is not possible, it is not possible. But as soon as you think that it is possible, it is possible. Upon hearing the spiritual master's order, the low-class devotee says, "Impossible. I will never be able to do it,” but the high-class devotee says, “Although it may not be possible, my spiritual master told me to do it, so I'll do it. I have no idea how, but I'll pray to the lotus feet of the Lord and Śrīla Prabhupāda to make it possible.” Anything is possible if it is the order of the spiritual master. The order of the spiritual master makes the impossible possible.

In spiritual life it is extremely important to act in a way that pleases the spiritual master because when he is pleased with us, he will give us the mercy by which we can do impossible things. That book distribution should continually increase is from a material viewpoint practically impossible, yet by Śrīla Prabhupāda's mercy book distribution continues to increase year after year. Therefore we should throw ourselves down in front of Śrīla Prabhupāda at least three times a day and beg for his blessings and mercy to continue to advance in spiritual life, to develop our devotional qualities, and to increase this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. By Śrīla Prabhupāda's mercy, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa will be pleased with us. And when Kṛṣṇa is pleased, He will bestow upon us His causeless mercy and bless us to always be able to increase our preaching. Success in preaching comes only when we depend fully on the spiritual master and get his mercy.

sub=Making the Spiritual Master's Order Your Order

No matter what happens we will go on producing and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. If a time ever comes when that is not happening, then I am prepared to make the money to produce and distribute the books myself. I will get a job digging ditches if necessary. Anything against production and distribution of books can be rejected. We would rather die than give up distributing books! That is the feeling that Śrīla Prabhupāda has implanted in me.

A disciple should not think of anything other than fulfilling the order of the spiritual master. He should meditate on how to make that order his goal in life, for by that he will attain perfection. Even if for some reason he may not be able to fulfill the order immediately, he should with complete and utter surrender meditate on how to get to the point of fulfilling it.

The order for book distribution has descended through the disciplic succession, so it is a very important instruction and we all must follow it. The mercy of this book distribution will transform the face of this world. We have already seen so many transformations taking place, for example, all the changes in Eastern Europe. Of course, we do not take credit for all of the changes, but the intense effort to distribute large quantities of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books creates an auspicious atmosphere for change. Our book distribution is making a wholesale revolution, because by teaching people the spiritual quality of life, they will naturally and automatically want to change the way this modern society is running. More and more persons will become interested in spiritual life, give up eating meat, fish, and eggs, and start to realize that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is something special.

Although the external symptoms of transformation may not be easily seen, that so many people already have books is evidence that a revolution is taking place. Rohiṇīsuta Prabhu was telling me that when he offers books to the people in Zurich, they say, “I already have thirty of them.” Such persons are becoming auspicious. When people have this science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in their homes, preaching to them is easy. These books are the life and soul of the preaching mission, so let us keep the order of the spiritual master to produce and distribute books in the forefront of our consciousness and make it our life and soul.

sub=Think Big

In a war the enemy always puts up a front. You may decimate them with bombs, but they will claim that no damage was done. One side reports eight million of the enemy killed, and the other side reports only twenty-two people lost in battle but five billion of the enemy killed. In a war everybody makes propaganda. In the war between <em>māyā</em> and this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, <em>māyā</em> is putting up a big front as if we were not effective. But that is not the truth. <em>Māyā</em> may be reporting over her radio waves that she has scored big successes over Kṛṣṇa consciousness and that Kṛṣṇa consciousness has made only a little progress, but the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has reported that the world is sinking fast and that <em>māyā</em> is gradually surrendering her hold. We are assaulting <em>māyā's</em> strongholds. Our <em>saṅkīrtana</em> vans are assault-vehicles from which the devotees spring forth to battle <em>māyā</em> by distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books all over the world. We must be determined because <em>māyā</em> is fighting a dirty, messy war against Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The month of December is holy because it is the month of the mahā-marathon. This marathon should make all the other marathons we have ever done look like kids' stuff. We have <em>māyā</em> on the run. All over the world people are beginning to understand that there is no hope with <em>māyā</em> and no solution except Kṛṣṇa. But don't give up and think that we have done enough and we cannot do any more. Keep on pushing until you see a breakthrough, and then become enthusiastic to do even more. When you understand that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only solution, you will want to increase your distribution unlimitedly. You will want to do three hundred books in an hour. Although that seems a little unreasonable, if you set your sights high, Kṛṣṇa will give you the ability to make wonderful things happen.

Think big! Śrīla Prabhupāda never thought little. He said that his disease was that he could not think little; he could only think big. Now all of his sons and daughters, grandsons and granddaughters have contracted this hereditary disease—we have to think big. If you only think little, of course you may accomplish your goal. But what is the use of that? You should try to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and think, “Yes, we are going to take over the world for Kṛṣṇa." Taking over the world does not mean political or economic takeover. It means we want to establish that Kṛṣṇa is <em>param īśvara</em>, the supreme controller, and not <em>māyā</em>.

If we set our sights big and go out during the Prabhupāda Marathon with enthusiasm, regardless of what our normal occupation might be, we will be able to distribute enormous amounts of books. We should never forget that each of us is a part of the biggest mission. Every devotee has a big part to play because there are so few of us and the mission is so big. No one should underestimate the importance of his role within this mission, and everyone should push on without any other thought in mind.

sub=Pick a Fight with the Asuras

Kṛṣṇa is not without desire. Out of His causeless mercy, He instructs His associates to kindly descend into the material world to distribute transcendental knowledge. Śrīla Prabhupāda once said that he was peacefully situated in the spiritual world, when Kṛṣṇa asked him, "Could you go down to the material world and preach? Don't worry, I will take care of everything. Just go down and write your books.” In this way Prabhupāda came to the material world to pick a fight with the <em>asuras</em>.

Śrīla Prabhupāda's books disturb the demoniac mentality because the demons cannot tolerate spiritual knowledge. The demons want everybody to remain in ignorance and suffering forever. Because of the resistance of the demons, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must enter the demoniac society like a needle, so that we can bring spiritual knowledge to the people of this world. Then this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can turn into a plow and transform this world by spiritual revolution.

Kṛṣṇa wants this transformation to take place and He has chosen us to do it, not because we are qualified but because Kṛṣṇa is giving us the mercy. The spreading of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement through the distribution of transcendental knowledge is the greatest benediction of our lives, for by establishing Kṛṣṇa consciousness in others, we also establish it in ourselves.

sub=We Are Ready for Saṅkīrtana-samādhi

We take advantage of associating together, so that when we depart to our respective destinations, our minds will be fixed on satisfying Śrīla Prabhupāda by distributing hundreds of thousands of his books. If we have in our hearts the desire to perform this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission with love and devotion, we will be successful. Now is the time to free ourselves from all other thoughts and desires and go into <em>saṅkīrtana-samādhi</em>. We have finished with <em>āsana</em> and <em>prāṇāyāma</em>. We have finished with <em>dhyāna</em> and <em>dhāraṇā</em>. We are now ready for full absorption in our worshipable object—the mercy of Lord Caitanya and Śrīla Prabhupāda.

We are asking everyone to shift into high gear and turn up the steam, for we want to start chugging away on the train back home, back to Godhead and we don't want any slow pokes or anchors hanging out the back. Yet this train is big and we want all the living entities to come aboard, so we are in the engine compartment, stoking up the engine by offering these books in the fire of the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>. And the more we offer these books to people, the more the engine is getting hot enough to go back to Godhead.

Many people have Śrīla Prabhupāda's books sitting on their bookshelves, many are reading the books, and many are convinced that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the best thing—they just don't want to admit it right now because they are afraid that they will appear foolish to others. But one day all these people will stand up for what they know to be good, and when they do, they will turn around and see thousands of Hare Kṛṣṇa centers.

Our traveling preaching parties are like fishermen. Our nets comb the ocean of nescience and pick up fish who don't get out of the way and who like to be caught in the net, and we put the fish in little bowls called <em>nāma-haṭṭa</em> centers. Then other people can come and see them, and more and more people can learn about chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

The spreading of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement begins with, is maintained with, and will go on to successful culmination by the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Book distribution makes everything successful, but stopping book distribution makes everything go to hell; therefore we must go on with this book distribution mission. If it is not going on, you should feel so terrible that you will not be able to sleep. Every devotee should be so dedicated that he is ready to do anything to keep the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission increasing.

We request all of you to please, kindly take up this mission very strongly and sincerely, and don't stop. We will go on requesting this until everyone takes it up very seriously. Even then we will still request it because it is the nicest request. We will never be satisfied to request anything else. If you go on with this transcendental <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, producing and distributing transcendental literature and teaching others transcendental knowledge, both you and those you meet will be happy and successful. You will especially please Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, and the entire disciplic succession, and they will shower their blessings upon you.

It is guaranteed that those who engage in this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission will go back home, back to Godhead. Lord Caitanya Himself said to one of His devotees, "You just go on preaching, and in the future you will have My association again in this place.” Preaching in separation is a higher service. Lord Caitanya guarantees that if we go on preaching and expanding this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, then without a doubt we will have Lord Caitanya's association in the spiritual world.

sub=Make Book Distribution Your Lifelong Mission

On behalf of Śrīla Prabhupāda and the previous <em>ācāryas</em>, I would like to thank everybody who has participated in this marathon or in the year-long <em>saṅkīrtana</em> marathon. This is the way to get the mercy. Although we make distinctions between number one, number two, and number three, everyone is a winner regardless of how one is placed according to his results. That is why everyone gets a prize in our <em>saṅkīrtana</em> marathon review at the end of the year. The amazing thing about the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> is that everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. Everyone is number one in the eyes of his spiritual master, who sees that someone has tried his hardest to spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Maybe one person has a greater capacity than somebody else, but that doesn't matter as long as you go out and give one hundred percent of your capacity. It doesn't matter if you are number one, thirty-eight, or one hundred thirty-eight, as long as you are giving as much as you can. We would never expect our "big guns” to do less than big results because that is what they can do. Yet we are surprised to see other devotees who hadn't been “big guns” in the past now doing so wonderfully, coming up to the top ten. They are granted mercy from all the Vaiṣṇavas without any hesitation.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is a lifelong mission. Some of you may not go on forever distributing books because at the age of fifty or sometimes even before that, the body rebels, although Grandfather Rohiṇīsuta Prabhu is teaching us that even with gray hair you can still go out. Even when your teeth are falling out and you have to walk with a cane, you can still tell people to please take a book. We can learn a good lesson from the older book distributors. We can keep going on, and the body can miraculously stay in good shape. There are people in the material world who run one-hundred-mile marathons when they are over fifty years old. If some old ladies can run a one-hundred-mile marathon, certainly the devotees can go on distributing books to a grand old age. Maybe your distribution methods will change and maybe you will distribute books from a wheelchair, but you can go on with this book distribution mission no matter what.

Śrīla Prabhupāda is pleased with everyone all over the world who has taken up this book distribution mission. Whatever country you come from, whether you are a man or a woman, in this book distribution mission everybody is equally, ecstatically engaged in Śrīla Prabhupāda's service. Therefore we offer our humble obeisances and respects to all the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes. I personally would love to go around and collect the dust from all the lotus feet of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and place it on my head, so that maybe one day I can also become purified. If it is true that Harināmānanda Prabhu works with Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa supplies whatever he wants, I beg him to kindly grant me some <em>kṛṣṇa-prema</em>, so that I can also go back home, back to Godhead.

If you really want to please Śrīla Prabhupāda, then just distribute his books. We don't want the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission to be a one-day mission or a couple-of-years mission. We don't want to be meteors flashing across the sky for a short time and then giving up. We don't want to be comets, brightly lighting up the sky but then going away. We want to be steady in devotional service throughout our lives, whether we are engaged directly in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission or preaching to inspire the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission or supporting it. Whatever part you play in this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, play it fully and completely with enthusiasm and devotion, and then you will be happy.

Even though the world may fall apart, and most places are already falling apart, distributing these books is the way to conquer the world for Kṛṣṇa. Just by giving the people these books, they can read Śrīla Prabhupāda's words and become transcendentally enlivened and inspired to go back home, back to Godhead.

sub=Following Śrīla Prabhupāda Throughout the Universe

Let us try to develop our love for Kṛṣṇa despite all the disturbances of the material condition, and let us, in the mood of love for Kṛṣṇa, go on distributing transcendental literature throughout human society. When you truly have love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, you will want to distribute His message far and wide because you will have Kṛṣṇa's mood of giving Kṛṣṇa consciousness to others.

That mood was demonstrated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who spent six years traveling around India, bringing Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the people there. He would just embrace you, and because of having contact with Lord Caitanya's transcendental body, you would become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then you would run off and embrace somebody else, who would also become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.

Although we may not have the potency to make people Kṛṣṇa conscious by embracing them, at least we have the potency to give Śrīla Prabhupāda's books to everyone. Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are filled with the potency to make people Kṛṣṇa conscious. By embracing his purports, people can become ecstatic with love of Godhead because these purports are Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental ecstasies.

Therefore we should be eager to distribute these books more and more throughout the world and satisfy Śrīla Prabhupāda's desire that his books be distributed in great quantities. Whatever he wants, we also want. Whatever is the order of the previous <em>ācāryas</em>, we take to heart and follow. As long as we have life in these bodies, we will go on with this transcendental mission of book distribution, and even when these bodies don't have life in them anymore, we will go on with this mission in the next life.

Some of us, of course, may want to go back home, back to Godhead. If you have been distributing these books throughout this life, you have the right to want to go back home, back to Godhead. Wanting to go back home, back to Godhead, is an advanced state of consciousness, but it is even more advanced to think, “Let me just distribute these books for the rest of my lives. Life after life, let me follow Śrīla Prabhupāda throughout the universe and fulfill my responsibility to him by bringing back all these lost conditioned souls.” Whether you want to go right back to Godhead or follow Śrīla Prabhupāda throughout the universe is up to you, but right now we want to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness by distributing these books, so we beg you to take this mission seriously and increase your distribution more and more. And in this way you will become happy.

sub=Perfection

What is perfection? In our opinion, perfection means to dedicate your life and soul to producing and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Somehow or other get that mission done! Be a part of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, either by directly distributing or by supporting the distribution, and help others to get Śrīla Prabhupāda's mercy.

We worship the Supreme Lord through the worship of His transcendental literature; therefore we should distribute it with incredible enthusiasm for the sake of humanity at large. Don't be stingy! Don't be lazy! Don't be foolish! Don't be mental! Don't speculate! Don't hesitate! And don't wait! Just jump into the transcendental bliss of capturing the lotus feet of the Lord through this book distribution process.

sub=A Gift of Love

Śrīla Prabhupāda has given us the gift of love of Godhead along with the glorious mission of distributing it to others. Let us increase the effort to distribute his books more and more, thus forever glorifying his name and fame! (July 31, 1989)

My mission is Prabhupāda's mission. He wants to produce and distribute his books throughout the world and I want to do that too. I also want to make the Mayapur Project, and that is his desire. His main desires are my main desires. I have consciously developed my desires in that way. This is an act of the intelligence and the heart. When there is love for the spiritual master then there is a real desire to please him, and this is the best way to please him. So consciously make your desires the same as the desire of your spiritual master and become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (June 6, 1992)

I have made my life's direction under the order of Śrīla Prabhupāda to produce and distribute his books in every language of the world. I am at least trying to do that in my zone and hope that I can encourage others to do it as well. Please also make your life completely dedicated to Śrīla Prabhupāda's mission and you will become Kṛṣṇa conscious and completely happy in this life. (April 22, 1992)

This book distribution mission is the highest form of welfare work for the people of this world. All other forms of welfare work miss the mark, for they ultimately are meant to satisfy the senses of certain vested interests. Even if someone is actually sincere in performing welfare work, he does it for his own extended self-interest, such as “my nation,” “my community,” or even “my humanity.” No one is pure in their motivation anymore and no one performs charity in the mode of goodness with the aim of purification. Therefore, our book distributors are the most magnanimous souls, because they are giving people the most precious gift—books about the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa—and taking from them some <em>lakṣmī</em>, which is then utilized to print more books and to maintain our wonderful temples wherein the Lord is worshiped and glorified. They cannot do any other activity with their <em>lakṣmī</em> that is better than this act of purchasing a book.

Of all of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, he was most pleased when the big books were distributed. He always wanted big books sold in large quantities, for these big books were specifically written by Śrīla Prabhupāda for creating a revolution in the hearts of misguided humanity. Therefore, you are doing the most important service there in Ireland by distributing the big books of Śrīla Prabhupāda. You are leading the way with your good example and determination. This example is going to affect the other devotees there as well, and they will also ultimately take up this process of distributing big books. Therefore, please stay there in Inishrath and continue to distribute big books and inspire the other distributors to do this as well. This will very much please Śrīla Prabhupāda and the entire disciplic succession. Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Your service is very valuable. You should remain fixed in that service for a long time and become qualified to realize the Supreme Lord and His eternal pastimes even while you are still in this material body. This is the ultimate result of surrendering one's very life and soul to the book distribution mission of the Lord. You have a great opportunity there and a good field for distribution. Please make it successful and continue there with great enthusiasm. (March 30, 1992)

I think your prayer to the Lord to recover His city for Him is fine. Now please always think in that way, and by your loving devotion you will be able to take over the city for the sake of the Lord. I also think that if you just go on distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, especially <em>Śrī Īśopaniṣad</em> and the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, then definitely you will feel very happy and satisfied.

Here we are making a real <em>saṅkīrtana</em> revolution. We are distributing all the books for twice the BBT price and thus supporting all the activities of the movement in this way. It is a great struggle and requires great preaching efforts, but we are getting many names and addresses and following them up with full set distribution. It is extremely encouraging. Over four hundred sets were sold in two months. The devotees are determined to try, although their results have gone way down at the start. I am sure that later on the results will be bigger than ever before, but we must be patient. (February 9, 1985)

You have distributed many books, and this is very nice. By doing this, you are pleasing Śrīla Prabhupāda in the very best way. It is understood that the father is strict with the children, but the grandfather is lenient and spoils the children. Therefore, you are receiving unrestrictedly the mercy of Śrīla Prabhupāda, because you are distributing his transcendental literature.

There is something very special about distributing on the subways or the platforms in N.Y. I would suppose it is because it is so hellish there. I also did this service and it was always very ecstatic. One can conquer the whole city by distributing <em>prasādam</em> in the subways and platforms. If you also give the people you distribute to some <em>prasādam</em>, they will never forget you. People there are suffering and looking for love. The last place they expect to find it is on those platforms. Even if they don't take a book then, the <em>prasādam</em> will impress them so much that they will take a book later.

I am very pleased with you. By your sincerity I am being maintained. (May 30, 1986)

sub=Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī

I have a disturbance. Something is always giving me pain and you, as a surrendered disciple, may dedicate your life to relieving me of that suffering condition. My suffering is that all the fallen souls are without proper knowledge of what is their actual position in relation to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Due to this ignorance they are put into so many inconveniences. Therefore, a Vaiṣṇava is <em>para-duḥkha-duḥkhī</em>—he is feeling pain when others are feeling pain.

Therefore, how do you relieve this suffering condition? By distributing more and more books and inspiring others to also do so. By distributing this transcendental literature more and more, you will gradually bring Kali-yuga to a halt and once again establish the Golden Age. Please make this business your life's mission and help others to also take to this mission very seriously. Thus there will be all perfections and blessings poured upon you through the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. (May 6, 1978)

The reason we place so much emphasis on book distribution is as follows: People are not very capable of understanding something they hear, especially the first couple of times. People are slow, <em>mandāḥ</em>, in this age of Kali, and they cannot understand even the simplest things. Therefore, when we speak to them, mostly they go away with a feeling whether this was good or bad, nice or not nice, and little philosophical realization other than that. Sometimes we think ourselves great preachers, but really, although we might be good preachers, the persons we preach to are not good listeners, and therefore, the preaching is not always the most effective means of reaching them.

Therefore the books. The books are physical objects that speak to them always. They can read the lines again and again until they understand them perfectly. They can read over the course of years and thus learn the philosophy. These books are perfect in all respects, but our preaching is always full of various faults. So whether we preach directly, or perhaps more indirectly, the goal is the same: to give them a set of the books to study. The books have made everyone devotees directly or indirectly. I am not concerned whether you serve in this or that preaching capacity so long as it is authorized by the temple authorities. (March 29, 1988)

You can understand more about why you are on the streets doing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> by asking the older devotees why you are there, and also hearing lectures by older devotees, where the subject matter is explained. You are on the street because it is the order of the spiritual master and especially of Śrīla Prabhupāda, as he wanted his books distributed far and wide throughout this world. It is the best means of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the more books go out, the more the people will surrender to Kṛṣṇa in due course of time. You are performing the highest welfare work for the people of your country by distributing these books. Please do it with great dedication, and Kṛṣṇa will grant you His mercy without a doubt. (September 2, 1991)

sub=The Higher Taste

Sometimes <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees try to do other services, but usually these other services fail in due course of time. Fools think that this is because the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee is incapable of doing anything else, because he was never trained in any other way, but I reject that idea. Training is not the only cause of success in a particular occupation. The main cause is desire and determination. Once a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee gets the taste for saving the conditioned souls directly by giving them a book, he cannot lose that taste, and other services seem pale in comparison.

This is not a fault, rather a deep realization. Thus it makes sense that you are useless at other things, because at heart you are a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. This is the highest form of preaching, and thus your heart is spontaneously attracted to it like a bee to pollen. Do not think there is anything wrong with that, even if oceans of fools and rascals proclaim this from the rooftops.

You will be situated back in the abode of Kṛṣṇa very quickly simply by doing this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service for the rest of your life.

Being brahminical means to always engage in teaching and helping others. In your case this means to teach, inspire, and do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, avoiding the filthy hole of householder attachments. (March 23, 1985)

I am very pleased to hear how you are increasing your book distribution by giving out Prabhupāda's books more and more. There is nothing more satisfying than that. Just go on in this way, without attachment to the results. (Results must be there, since that is the nature of book distribution. We must distribute books and that is a result.) By engaging in this book distribution mission your natural love for Kṛṣṇa will automatically increase more and more by His grace and pleasure. (June 2, 1985)

You are not a <em>sahajiyā</em> if you say that you love to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. You are simply a normal, fully adjusted <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. That person who said that we are not yet on that platform, to speak like that, obviously is not on that platform. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is our life and soul and we not only can love it, we should! Please go on loving <em>saṅkīrtana</em>; it will save you in these troubled times.

People are in a very bad state, yet some of them are blissfully becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious despite it all, simply through the reading of Prabhupāda's books. This is wonderful. You will see it more and more, since you are out in the world and realizing it daily. Others who stay in the temple cannot understand this. Perhaps also others, even if they go out, also cannot understand this. But you can and that is good.

Kṛṣṇa will glance on you, since you are spreading His glories. You are sincere and properly engaged. Besides that, you have nice realization of Him, so why shouldn't He glance upon you lovingly? He does love you, there is no doubt about this. Just go on demonstrating your love for Him by distributing this transcendental literature as you are doing. (August 10, 1987)

sub=The Perfection of Life

I was especially glad to hear that you are most eager to preach and distribute books. That is certainly the topmost of all spiritual engagements. I am always very pleased to accept disciples who are saṅkīrtaners. They are the topmost personalities. (May 19, 1981)

If you want to surrender your life fully to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, then please, by all means do so, for this is the perfection of life. This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is the means to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world where the people are suffering in ignorance due to their lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So please surrender your life to this mission and make it your number one duty. Distribute books, distribute books, distribute books. (May 4, 1991)

You can accomplish a lot in your lifetime for the spreading of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Your present understanding that these books are the basis of all preaching success is absolutely correct. There is no better way to preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement than through the distribution of this transcendental literature.

Śrīla Prabhupāda was so pleased to see his books distributed. He was ecstatic to hear the scores. Other things were nice, but this was the real nectar. If this was not going on, then the other things had no taste. Book distribution is our real mission and nothing else compares to it. There are many different ways to distribute books, so please choose whichever means suits you best. There are many experts there in Germany, so follow in their footsteps. (June 10, 1988)

I am very happy that you are making <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with such seriousness and determination. Every week so many letters are coming from the conditioned souls, many of them directly inquiring about how to obtain relief from material existence and take advantage of the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If we can become an instrument for assisting the spiritual master in his work of reclaiming the bewildered materialists, then we should have no doubt that we are most fortunate and firmly fixed on the path back to Godhead. You are a nice, intelligent girl, and I would like very much that you dedicate your life's energies to spreading real happiness — spiritual happiness—to everyone. You and the other devotees should take good advantage of the present circumstances, which may end at any moment. So all of you become fixed in knowledge, distribute knowledge, and absorb yourselves more and more in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Books are the basis of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are more and more distributed, then certainly everything will become successful and auspicious for everyone in due course. (Undated)

It would, of course, be best if you were engaged in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission by directly selling Prabhupāda's books. This is the best of all services and the one that will help you advance in spiritual life the quickest. Selling Prabhupāda's books turns you from a neophyte to an advanced devotee, especially if you are always engaging in studying these books at the same time. If you are carefully reading these books and distributing them, your Kṛṣṇa consciousness will expand more and more. Of this there is no doubt. (October 14, 1990)

It is not at all true that you are disconnected with “my mission” if you are in another zone. You are distributing in my BBT zone, and therefore you are still, in a very real sense, in my zone. It makes absolutely no difference to me whether you preach in my GBC zone or my BBT zone. In fact, if you had to, you could live in someone else's zone, and that would also be all right, if you would just go on with the preaching mission. This mission is Śrīla Prabhupāda's mission. I have no separate or independent mission, and if you are fulfilling the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda, regardless of where it is, I feel myself successful as a spiritual master. You are engaged in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and you are serving Kṛṣṇa sincerely. I am pleased by that. It will not please me more if you are living in my GBC zone. This is not at all required. I am trying not to be fruitive; that is our philosophy, isn't it? You are serving Kṛṣṇa and that is perfection, regardless of where the service is being performed. So please just go on serving Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master nicely wherever you are. That will certainly please me.

Please always stay happy in your service of transcendental book distribution. Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. (March 18, 1992)

This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is so sublime, and every sincere devotee will find a place within it. There is an ocean of bliss available for all devotees who continue with this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission every day, and then they will dive into the ocean and splash around in it ecstatically. Please be one of the lucky persons who are always absorbed in the transcendental preaching service of the Lord. (March 7, 1990)

If you can distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, that will be the perfection of your life. Even if it is a bit difficult in the beginning, if you just try over long periods of time, you will get the hang of it and become a useful devotee in ISKCON. Of course, all services are absolute and useful, but what is really needed now is to increase the number of book distributors. So try this service with all your determination and see if you can do it nicely. (September 4, 1991)

The desire to assist in the production and distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is the topmost of all desires, since this service is the real core and life of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. If you maintain this desire throughout your life, you will return back to Godhead without a doubt.

Please continue to render service to those great souls who are engaged in producing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Be humble and always aware of how it is an honor to produce these books. It is a rare opportunity to be part of the team producing these books, so count your blessings and continue to work with great enthusiasm. Kṛṣṇa will be pleased upon you and your countrymen. (August 2, 1987)

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees get the perfection of mercy, and no other form of mercy can compare to it. The perfection of life is to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee always engaged in Lord Caitanya's mission. Therefore, what is there for you to fear? Rather, the others who are not engaged in this service have more to fear, since they must struggle more to attain the same Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't worry about what your mind tells you; it is generally all nonsense anyway. Neither worry too much about other speculations as well. Just go on distributing these books and all perfection will come little by little. At least have that faith. (October 6, 1986)

sub=Depend on Kṛṣṇa

It is wonderful that you are going on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. You should just distribute as much as you can and depend on Kṛṣṇa fully for the results. In this way, you will never be frustrated with the results. However, you should learn from other advanced <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and learn from them how to distribute more and more. You should distribute perhaps fifty books a day and then you should increase more and more. If you are only doing less per day, that is also all right, but try to do more by learning the technique from other advanced <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. This will help you more and more. Always try to increase your distribution as this is required in <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Then, when you get to a certain level where it is very hard to do better, you can just keep on distributing at that level for a long time. (June 6, 1992)

Everything is happening because of the will of the Supreme Lord. He is the controller of all events and He is the enjoyer of the results. Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth, and we must learn to surrender unto Him alone. You are presently too attached to the fruits of your results; therefore, you are unable to distribute much. Perhaps also you do not have the required qualities to be a good distributor.

You will have to learn the art of distribution from other devotees who are already expert at distributing these Kṛṣṇa conscious books. Learn from them humbly, follow in their footsteps, and become expert in this way. You have to learn the art of surrendering yourself to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. This is not so easy to do when one is not so expert at distribution. First, you have to learn all the techniques of book distribution and then you have to learn the art of surrendering to the mission with all your heart and soul. It is not something that can be done quickly or from one day to the next, but it is something that will build up over longer periods of time, day by day. Therefore, just try to distribute with a straw in your mouth, being very humble and submissive to the will of the Lord, and you will gradually develop your ability more and more. (November 4, 1989)

I can try to give you a small example of what it means to depend on Kṛṣṇa. You might be standing at a distribution place, and there are no people, or you are between people. At that time, you might be praying to the Lord in the heart to help you say just what the people need to hear in order to take a book. A person approaches, and you go to him. As you approach him, you think of Kṛṣṇa—almost as a cry at first, and later, when you are more advanced, as a friend. As your mouth opens to speak, some inspiration might be there and you pick up on it—it might be just what the person needs to hear. Other times you start almost blindly, but with faith that Kṛṣṇa will force you to start speaking the right words. You have to feel His presence through your faith. In other words, you start speaking because you have to, and then you feel inspired to speak in a certain way, you pick up on that inspiration, and continue to speak. If you have the proper faith, you will speak in just the right way, and the Supersoul in his heart will help him understand. But please remember that the ultimate choice is his; he might reject all this help from the transcendental Lord, or he might accept it, for whatever reason of his own. In any case we remain fixed in our duty, without attachment to success or failure. For us, that contact with Kṛṣṇa through our service is completely satisfying. Later, when your desire to help these people intensifies, your conviction can force them to take a book, although they might not have wanted to. That is the best platform. A powerful preacher can inject Kṛṣṇa consciousness into the hearts of the fallen souls by his own spiritual potency, of course derived from the mercy of his spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. (April 15, 1983)

I am sorry that you are not feeling strong enough to distribute full time. Sometimes some devotees are not as strong as other devotees, and there often is not much that can be done about this. You simply have to go on with your <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service with as much determination as you can. You should pray to Kṛṣṇa that He will increase your determination, and then when you endeavor He will help you. It is said, “God helps those who help themselves.” So you should depend on Kṛṣṇa fully and try your very best to engage in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. Do not underestimate the power of prayer. Kṛṣṇa is listening to us, and if our prayers are helpful for our advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, He always answers them. So depend on Kṛṣṇa and try your best. You can do nothing more than that. Then it might be possible that you go out for a longer time each day and in this way increase your results. (June 3, 1991).

sub=Throw Away the Crutches

It has become more and more obvious throughout the years that the only method of doing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> for a long time is to sell the book on the merit of the book itself without using "crutches” of false stories of welfare activities. One may be able to do that for a while, but later on he thinks it is simply parrot-like repetition and wants to do something else. Always present the books for what they are and preach. It will satisfy you more than any other form of distribution.

Those who are occasional distributors may require mantras, lines, and other crutches to help them out, and that is all right. But the regular saṅkīrtaners must be strict and deliver the books for what they are—the highest transcendental knowledge available in the universe. By good preaching and example, one can transform the other's ideas of how to distribute. This is the way it was done in Switzerland and it can also be done there.

The temple president must be the ultimate <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader, for without his pushing it and arranging things nicely for <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, how can it go on? But the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> itself may or may not be organized by him directly, for others may be more qualified. But he has to have the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> spirit and dedication. He might not go to international <em>saṅkīrtana</em> meetings, but he will gladly push on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> in whatever way he can. If you are the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader, then you must organize it properly. The temple president can assist you from his own position. (November 11, 1988)

Do not worry if you are somewhat attached to the result in the beginning. That is natural. But that can go away, after a while, when you realize how flickering is this sense gratification. That comes from doing nicely on book distribution or anything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When you realize that it is not you doing these nice things but Kṛṣṇa, then you become very peaceful and undisturbed, even if everyone is cheering you and shouting your name. All glories go to the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, for it is they who are actually expanding the service more and more. (May 2, 1991)

sub=Don't Be Fruitive

Your spiritual progress is not exactly attached to the number of books that you are distributing. You can go on making progress, even if the number of books that you distribute is changing. Sometimes it is like that, one day you do more and then you do less. It will change also throughout the year, some months better and some worse. Especially the marathons will be better. If you just go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and dedicate yourself to this service, then you will be happy and satisfied. This determination to engage in <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is developed when you dedicate your life to the mission of the spiritual master. When you see his mission as your mission and you understand that the satisfaction of the spiritual master is the main goal in life, then you can dedicate yourself fully to this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. (May 30, 1991)

Please do not be in anxiety. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not meant for being in anxiety, but rather for peacefulness and tranquility. Of course, Arjuna was neither peaceful nor tranquil on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, but when he wasn't fighting he was peaceful. So maybe when you are on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> battlefield, the streets, you may not always be peaceful, but sometimes a kind of calm peace also settles into your life on the streets due to the mercy of the Supreme Lord.

Please do not think that I only care about you when you are doing big on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. I am concerned about your advancement whether you are doing big or not so big. The real point is that you should develop your love for Kṛṣṇa and surrender to Him more and more. Please do not be so fruitive; it is not good for your spiritual life. Fruitive action is only seemingly beneficial for a short while, but in the long run it binds us to the material world. You should act only for the sake of pleasing Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master. When the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa see that you are going out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> every week year after year, naturally they become very compassionate toward you and give you their mercy. This is the main point that you should remember: The spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa are most impressed with your steadiness of service. So please be steady and determined to surrender to the Lord and you certainly will achieve the desired goal. (January 4, 1991)

There is nothing wrong with steadily doing the same thing on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> day in and day out for years. This is the symptom of steadiness. You should be satisfied that you are doing steadily, and then you should go out and do what you can do without worrying about the results. The results are not up to you; they are up to Kṛṣṇa. If you are only capable of doing thirty books a day, then so be it and be satisfied. If you can only do ten books a day, then do that and be satisfied. I am satisfied that you are every day going out and trying hard, so you should be satisfied that I am satisfied, because that means that Kṛṣṇa is satisfied and that is good.

Sometimes you will feel better and sometimes you will feel worse. That is the nature of the material world. In this world, one goes up and down all the time. That is natural in this material world. So go on with your devotional service despite the ups and downs of the material world and you will remain happy all the time. This is spiritual happiness. You may not be materially happy, but if you are satisfying your spiritual master, then that is spiritual happiness and that is eternal. Just go on with your <em>saṅkīrtana</em> program and do not lament for the ups and downs of the material world. Try to surrender to Kṛṣṇa more and more; engage yourself in devotional service more and more; and be happy in this service. It is happiness just to be engaged in devotional service. (June 19, 1991)

It is not required that you be first on the marathons. You may be whatever position you can be in, that does not matter. What matters is that you are going on and serving the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and that this service is gradually getting better and better and that your love for Kṛṣṇa is increasing. The results are up to Kṛṣṇa and not up to us. You just do as best you can and that is good enough. If you come in first, that is the Lord's mercy, and if you come in third, that is the Lord's mercy. But no lower than third. (June 27, 1991)

The next time you find yourself attached to the results of your work, and thus creating a disturbance in your distribution, you should think as follows: "I shall not be attached to the fruits of my labor. I shall not see the people as merely another statistic. I shall look at the next person I meet as a spirit soul requiring my help. I do not even care if he takes a book or not. I only care that he is helped somehow by me. I know that it is best for him to take a book, but it might not be possible due to my contaminated consciousness at present. I pray to Kṛṣṇa that the living entities will take these books for their own benefit.” While praying like this, think of how Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master are pleased when you hand the people these books. Picture how the person will become enlightened by taking home this book and reading it. Thinking like this, you will surely give up the fruitive mentality. (April 19, 1989)

<em>Māyā</em> is also a good warrior in her own right. She creates the fruitive mentality among our <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes, so that they start thinking that they are the doers of action, which are in actuality carried out either by the material nature or the spiritual nature, depending on the consciousness of the performer; never are these actions created by ourselves alone.

During the “normal” year of distribution, you can clearly see that you are not the doer and you are glad to allow Kṛṣṇa to lead people to you. However, during the marathon times you become fruitive and forget Kṛṣṇa and think that you are a very strong and able <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee; therefore, why can't you do more? I would suggest that you just forget the fact that it is marathon and just go out as you normally do.

The marathon aspect should be taken up by others and not by yourself. You are always on marathon. You are always working at peak efficiency-more or less; I mean, you know that you are not giving one hundred percent, but the ninety-five percent that you are giving is quite acceptable. Since you are always engaged nicely in this service, if you try to artificially do more than what you can, you will fall apart and fall in <em>māyā</em>. This is very dangerous, and therefore you should carefully avoid all pretensions and just accept that you can only do what you can and no more, so long as the Lord is not sanctioning your increase. In other words, when Kṛṣṇa wants that you increase, you will, automatically, whether it is marathon or not. Then you will understand that this service is really only depending on Kṛṣṇa and not on you. When you see things like that, you can go on marathon and simply expect that Kṛṣṇa wants you to do more, and therefore, He will arrange that in the same way that He sends people during the “normal” <em>saṅkīrtana</em> times. In other words, just place yourself in the arms of Kṛṣṇa and He will arrange everything. That means that you should still endeavor by going out and meeting the people, but for the results, you should simply surrender to Kṛṣṇa and see what He wants from you. (March 23, 1989)

sub=Steadily Going On

I am pleased that you are doing distribution and preaching steadily throughout all these years. You may not be doing a lot of distribution, and you may not be doing it with the perfect consciousness of compassion toward the conditioned souls, but at least you are doing it and that pleases me. You can please me more by developing the proper consciousness in distribution and engaging yourself more purely in devotional service, that is a fact. So please just continue with your service as you have been doing steadily for years now, and try to develop a more compassionate understanding of the people on the street. I can understand that it is difficult, because the people are so foolish sometimes, but if you keep reading Prabhupāda's books, you will start to see them with a transcendental eye and you will understand that they are following the dictations of the three modes of material nature. If you give them Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then they will advance beyond the influence of the modes and become transcendental. It is up to you to give them a chance to advance beyond the lower modes of nature and to taste a bit of the higher platform of spiritual life. Please just go on with this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and just by doing it, however imperfectly, you will please me and Śrīla Prabhupāda. (November 3, 1991)

Regarding the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men's feeling of frustration at not being able to freely express themselves as devotees—I think that problem was solved by their doing some street chanting each week and short distribution. That should be sufficient to overcome that feeling. But they should not fall into the trap thinking that there is some service that is higher than this street book distribution. No one should ever forget for a moment that this is the most important method of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness and no other method is as important. One who is distributing books is simply paving his way back to the spiritual world. (November 12, 1980)

Single-minded intelligence means that you are determined to execute the instructions of the spiritual master without deviation. Now if the authorities and the GBC decide that you should make a traveling preaching party, then you should do it with great determination. But if they say that you should remain on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, then you should do that with great determination.

As a general rule, I think that it is better that you remain on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> until you absolutely cannot go further. Then you can take up these other programs one after another. In the meantime, you should fix your mind on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and not be disturbed with other ideas. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is our life and soul and it should not be disturbed by mental speculation. This is a problem with many devotees. They are already doing the highest service, and then they want to do something else that completely destroys their determination to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Please do not become a devotee like that. You are already doing the nicest <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and often you are the top distributor, so please do not change that for doing some other program. When you are older and cannot do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> anymore, then you can do many programs and we shall be happy to see you preaching in that way. But until then, just go on as you are going and increase your distribution more and more. Thank you for this distribution. You are pleasing me very much. (May 2, 1991)

It is very good that you are attached to making books for the BBT and selling books on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. This is very good service attitude, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with such conception. I am sorry to hear that your husband does not want you to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, since <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is the very best service for purification of the heart and mind. At least you should do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> during these years, while you are still young enough, because later on when you will get older it will be very difficult to continue. Older devotees cannot go on distributing in the same manner and they generally take to managerial positions. So I would suggest that when the BBT service is finished, that you continue with <em>saṅkīrtana</em> until you cannot do it anymore and that will help you in your endeavor to become purified. Otherwise, you will have to stay around the temple and always be disturbed because of this and that problem with overcrowded devotees. (July 16, 1990)

sub=Vāṇī-saṅga

You are a sincere girl and certainly Kṛṣṇa will help you to learn all that you must to become a good <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. Kṛṣṇa is in our hearts, and whenever He sees that His devotees are struggling to surrender unto Him, He very kindly takes the trouble to purify the devotee from within and give him the opportunity to surrender more and more.

You should not worry that you are seemingly not having personal relationship with your spiritual master. This understanding is false. You are always having personal relationship with the spiritual masters (including Śrīla Prabhupāda!) simply by following their order and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. This is the most personal and perfect way to serve the spiritual master. There is no better way than that. So please engage yourself in this mission and be blessed and happy. The marathon time is a time of blissfulness. Please take full advantage of it. (November 19, 1989)

I am very glad that you are enthusiastically engaged in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement and that you have accepted the burden of becoming a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader. The spiritual master is most pleased when his disciples accept part of the great burden that he feels for spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This pleases Kṛṣṇa very much. Therefore, I am most happy that you are engaged in this way, and I pray to Kṛṣṇa that you will increase your service more and more.

Please always be engaged in bringing new people to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then engage them in distributing these books, so that we can increase the distribution there in Yugoslavia more and more. Now in these times of political crisis, the people require the steady peace of Kṛṣṇa consciousness more than ever before. Therefore, give them the perfect philosophy and let them advance by reading these books. (February 25, 1991)

It is very nice to hear that there will soon be five <em>saṅkīrtana</em> groups for the <em>mātājīs</em>. This is very encouraging. Let all the girls in Germany be engaged in distributing these wonderful books of Śrīla Prabhupāda. These books are the life and soul of our spiritual life and without them we would have nothing. Prabhupāda gave his life for writing and distributing these books and we should pay back the great debt we all owe him by distributing these books more and more.

So go on with this process and continue developing <em>mātāji</em> consciousness for preaching and learning this philosophy more and more. Every devotee should become learned in the philosophy. Our girls are our hidden weapons. People do not expect to hear nice philosophy from ladies, and when they do hear it they become amazed and respectful. So if all our ladies can learn this philosophy nicely and at the same time distribute it through these books, the people of this country will have to accept it in due course of time. (June 3, 1991)

sub=Develop Compassion

It is not good to be so mental on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is a service that mainly utilizes the heart. One has to feel the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mood and desire greatly to help people, otherwise he cannot do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> in the proper spirit. Even just doing it to please the spiritual master is not the complete motivation for performing <em>saṅkīrtana</em>; it is a necessary prerequisite of course, but it is not sufficient. One must have compassion upon all the fallen souls. That is important.

You have to feel for them and want to help them as well, then your mood on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> will be complete. All your moods and mental problems come from not developing this ideal mentality. You may even want to become a “nothing," as you put it, because you are trying to avoid your duty to be compassionate to the people you are meeting. So try to see them as objects of your mercy and the mercy of Śrīla Prabhupāda, and this mentality will nicely help you overcome the modes of material nature. (September 5, 1991)

To properly go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, there must be a certain peace and balance in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee. This can be attained over longer periods when one is advancing in devotional service. Sometimes a devotee is immature and when he goes on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> it is difficult for him. But when a devotee is mature, then he can easily approach people and naturally be compassionate toward them and give them Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. When you understand that the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books is the means to change the world and make a revolution in the hearts of the misguided mankind, then you can distribute with determination. If you have that revolutionary fervor to change the world and make it a better place to live in, then you become eager to distribute our books. These books are the key to success in spiritual life; therefore, you should be eager to get them in the hands of the materialistic people who have no understanding of spiritual life. This understanding can grow in you as you advance and mature in devotional service. So please advance more and more in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; then gradually, your appreciation of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> will increase and you will become a mature and advanced devotee. This may take some time, so just go on and naturally it will come. (July 8, 1992)

sub=Do the Needful

I become enlivened just by hearing of your <em>saṅkīrtana</em> results. This makes me most inspired. It is nice to see how much every devotee is doing. This is the best way to please the Lord and get the mercy of the dust of His lotus feet. I think though that you must rest each Sunday and somehow get together to chant and feast with as many others as you can.

It is wonderful to hear that the people (at least some of them) are interested to hear about Kṛṣṇa and the soul. This is because they are naturally His servants, otherwise why would they have this interest? I would also be happy if you would devote yourself to full-time <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, but then how would everything go on? You can do the needful, whatever is required to be done, whenever you get a chance. But the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is the most important mission. (July 6, 1985)

Kṛṣṇa is pleased with a manager who does the needful and He always protects such a devotee. Kṛṣṇa will be pleased with you, and also I am pleased that Kṛṣṇa is pleased, when you are doing the service that must be done in a nice way. It is not that only book production or distribution pleases me; any service done with faith and love and devotion pleases me. I am pleased with the temple managers, who take care of things even though there are so many problems. It is much harder to be a temple president than to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, and therefore, the temple president gets a lot of mercy from the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa when he does his job nicely. (September 8, 1990)

It is all right if you cannot do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. You can still surrender to the Lord and become Kṛṣṇa conscious doing <em>pūjārī</em> work. Please do it with devotion. You may also serve the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees by cooking and cleaning for them and helping them. Not everyone is qualified to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and some, after trying it for a long time, cannot succeed. So then take up some other work and be happy with that work for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa accepts all work, although the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> work satisfies Him quickly and very quickly brings His mercy to you. But you will also get His mercy in due course of time by serving Him nicely on the altar. So do it nicely and be happy. (May 15, 1992)

I think it is fine that you are cooking and then one week a month going out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Both services are very much needed, and it is wonderful that you are able to get away at least one week a month and go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. I do not think that there is any need to change these services in any way, unless of course the circumstances dictate that a change should be there. You should not create any more changes in your service.

Yes, cooking or doing anything in the temple is difficult, since it is easier to be attacked by <em>māyā</em> in the temple where everything is so nice and easier than on the street. On the street one is more peaceful from the material desires than in the temple. But on the street there is another form of austerity, and the temple has its own form of austerity, so you should surrender to your service in the kitchen. Perform it as an austerity and make greater advancement doing that service. And for a relief you will go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> one week a month. That is very nice. I do not think that you have anything to worry about. (September 15, 1991)

sub=New Devotees

Also you can train the <em>bhaktas</em> in the temple for two months and then, when they are ready, send them out on full time traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> or out from the temple selling books. Every new devotee can go out and sell books, after a training program of a few months in the temple, learning in a <em>bhakta</em> program. So make a nice <em>bhakta</em> program and engage the new people accordingly. (January 24, 1991)

Generally most new devotees should stay in the temple at least two months before attempting to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with books. Of course, they can go out on the chanting party from the first day in the temple, since that is blissful. They should start book distribution gradually, going out with an older devotee every day from the temple and learning what to do. Then after a few days of learning, they can do it on their own near an older devotee. Then when they can stand on their own two feet, they are ready for traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. This is the general rule, but there are of course exceptions; some may be faster and some may be slower to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. (May 15, 1990)

I am also glad that you are doing better on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Do not be attached to the results. Just go out every day and try the best you can. Every <em>bhakta</em> and <em>bhaktin</em> should do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> for purification for at least two years. Then, if you have not surrendered to it by then, you can do other services that are also needed. But for now, just surrender to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission and just do it every day steadily. It does not matter whether you are doing big one day and bad another; what counts is that you are serving with love and devotion. So just go out and do not worry about the results. The results will depend on Kṛṣṇa and He will grant you the results as He desires. (July 13, 1991)

sub=Saṅkīrtana-sādhana

<em>Saṅkīrtana-sādhana</em> should be fixed by Rohiṇīsuta Prabhu or someone like him who is an expert in the needs and problems of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. I have previously demanded that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have the morning programs and that they read at least one hour each day if not more. They must never eat food prepared outside. They should get bread from the temple and they can cook something for themselves with a stove and a pressure cooker. They should get to rest early and rise properly. They may take seven hours of rest a day (or more if they need it). If one comes and is not very serious, then he should become serious through a study of the philosophy. Then he may become qualified to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Otherwise, he can clean the temple and others can go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Our philosophy makes one serious if one learns it well. (May 2, 1987)

I do not think that it is good that you go out at 6 a.m. and stay out till 8 or 9 p.m. This is too long—maybe not in the marathon times, but normally. You will burn yourself out both materially and spiritually by doing that. You should chant all or most of your rounds before you go out in the morning and you should also have <em>kīrtana</em> and read Śrīla Prabhupāda's books as well. Best would be that you read one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. You must study these books and get out of the mode of passion. You can then go out around 8 a.m. and stay out for ten hours with the break for lunch. If you follow your program of fourteen hours a day of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, you will not last for long.

If you read more and have a proper morning program, then you will not be attached to the results of your work. The whole <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> is about working without attachment for the results, and simply working out of duty with love for Kṛṣṇa, so you should learn this art by studying the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. You seem to be very much situated in the mode of passion. Then naturally you will be attached to the results. You should elevate yourself to the mode of goodness and work without attachment for the results. Then you will never be frustrated. Frustration is a symptom of the mode of passion or ignorance. Please rise above these modes and be situated transcendentally without attachment. Please study Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and develop your spiritual intelligence. Then your <em>saṅkīrtana</em> will be a real success. (September 14, 1990)

It is good that you go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> some hours a day. That will keep you spiritually healthy, and spiritual health is more important than any bodily health. (March 2, 1991)

sub=Do Not Worry

So you have your ups and downs on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>? So you are not a pure devotee yet? So you sometimes have a falldown? So what to do? I do not really understand the problem. Do you think that anyone is free from problems? As long as you are in the material world there will be problems. You are no exception. We have to tolerate. Toleration is the key to success—<em>tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata</em>. Tolerate and gradually you will develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness and not fall down. Do not get discouraged because you are sometimes weak; just keep trying and this will give strength over longer periods of time. Stop trying to be a perfected devotee immediately. Just serve and gradually you will become perfected. (February 5, 1988)

It is not "wrong” to ask why you are having problems on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. It is not against any Kṛṣṇa conscious principle. You may ask; however, asking might not be the most advantageous way to solve the problem. Even if you know that you are having a particular problem, the solution to all problems is the same; that is, you should surrender fully to Kṛṣṇa and pray to Him for His mercy, so that you can overcome the problem. Therefore, when there are problems it is advised to immediately go to the point of depending on Kṛṣṇa and asking Him to help you, instead of wasting time in deep psychoanalysis, trying to find out the various ins and outs of the particular problem you are presently experiencing.

Sometimes it might help if you understood your problem better, so that you can avoid in the future going down the same path that put you in the same problematic situation in the first place. From that point of view, it is important to know why you have falldowns and why you become disturbed. If you know why these things happen to you, then you will avoid doing those same things in the future, and this will help your spiritual life. In conclusion, it is sometimes good to know why some bad thing is happening to you, but not all the time, and basically on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> one should just depend on Kṛṣṇa all the time and pray for His mercy. And don't forget that all the <em>anarthas</em> in our hearts are the real cause for loss of enthusiasm, because as we become enthusiastic for material life we lose our enthusiasm for spiritual life. (June 14, 1992)

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is sometimes difficult. Sometimes one does really well, especially in the beginning, but then, as the time goes on, it gets harder. This is a test from Kṛṣṇa to see how determined you are. Every <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee has gone through this test. It always comes at one point. Therefore, you should remain on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and do it with great determination. Do not give up. Just try harder and harder to get the books into the hands of the people to save them from the miserable condition of material life. Only the devotees can save them, yet they are so foolish that they do not know that. Therefore, you are doing the greatest welfare work. You should never think that there is some other service that you should do. There is nothing more important than this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement.

Please continue it with determination, even if sometimes you do not do so many books. We are not after fruitive results; we simply want to do our best to serve the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. So please do the best you can and everyone will be satisfied. You should just fix your mind on this service. And if there is something grossly wrong, then we can repair that later on. (September 11, 1992)

You may not be able to continue on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> if you are materially engrossed. But this is a temporary state and can be quickly changed by taking a little vacation for a few days, hearing, chanting, and serving within the protected environment of the temple. If this is necessary, it should be done (not whimsically, however, for that will make us weaker and sicker if overused). Then when the raging senses calm down, then we can again battle <em>māyā</em> with strength. It is not easy to continue on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> like this without having the realization that we are doing a service that is most pleasing to the Supreme Lord, most important for the saving of the fallen souls, and the only means of even continuing our own devotional advancement. No one can continue in Kṛṣṇa consciousness without having the preaching spirit. Unless we are concerned with the spiritual advancement of others and work to help them spiritually, we will not have the energy, will, or strength to continue ourselves. Therefore, the most advanced devotees never relax or give up their preaching services; they have made it their life's work. (July 10, 1981)

It is sometimes true that one may temporarily have trouble owing to the nature of the material body. Our bodies are lusty and lazy; therefore, there are troubles to go out and do things for the sake of others. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is a completely selfless service and one that is best done by those without any personal motivation. Of course, it is also possible that one can do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with personal motivation, but it is not so blissful. If you are truly having problems to do that service, then you can also make a vacation by taking over the cooking duties from those in the temple, for example, and let them go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. (September 2, 1985)

Your problem is a typical one. It seems that you need a little break from <em>saṅkīrtana</em> for a while. I have seen other devotees in the past, who wanted to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and are enthusiastic, but sometimes they just break down and require a break for some time. After they take their break, they can continue <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with determination again.

So please take a short break, perhaps two to four weeks, stay in the temple and surrender to Kṛṣṇa there. Read Prabhupāda's books every day for a minimum of two hours (ABSOLUTELY!) and engage the rest of the day in devotional service, according to the advice of the temple president. This will help you. Then, when the break is over, again take up this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service with determination. I think that this should take care of the problem nicely. Do not worry. It happens to quite a few devotees periodically. (September 29, 1991)

If you require more rest after marathons, then take it. Prabhupāda used to say, “If you are tired, take rest; if you are hungry, eat.” In this way, we satisfy the demands of the body, but not overly. After you have worked so hard to satisfy Kṛṣṇa during the marathon times, you deserve some break and a rest. Do not feel guilty in taking it. However, this should not go on forever, since it will degrade into the mode of ignorance. You must learn to judge for yourself how long you require to rest and then break it off when it is becoming sense gratification. I think that you can do this.

If you require more reading, better chanting, and a little more rest, then you can, as you suggest, also do that in the temple for some time. This will save you from having to live up to some artificial standard in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van. It is important that you take care of yourself, otherwise you will burn out prematurely and be useless for all purposes.

I also do not know where the line is between taking care of the body for service, and just serving like a madman with no consideration. I am the worst person to ask. This is how I get into trouble all the time. But I am also learning in the school of hard knocks how to take care of the body more and more, so that it will go on functioning without breaking down.

In cases like these, the best thing is to just depend on Kṛṣṇa and ask Him to help us regulate our lives in the best possible manner. There is no other solution than depending fully on Kṛṣṇa in these cases. After all, we are limited and He is unlimited. Being unlimited, He can help us limited souls in an unlimited manner. So just ask Kṛṣṇa to help you understand what is the best thing to do, and surely He will help you as you require. (February 25, 1990)

If you are having troubles with the girls in your group, then it is good to change the group to lessen the troubles. When I was managing the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> in Germany personally, it was my weekly duty to change the groups, so that the devotees could be peaceful without interpersonal conflicts. So it is authorized to change the group members when required.

Sometimes it is difficult to continue <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. This is the influence of <em>māyā</em> trying to force us to give up our service, because it is such a powerful kick in the face of <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em> cannot tolerate all this <em>saṅkīrtana</em>; therefore, she tries to stop the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees from within by making them weak and afraid. Therefore, you have to directly counteract this <em>māyā</em> by carefully engaging in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission despite this disturbance. You have to tolerate these disturbing conditions and become very fixed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Please continue with this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> under all circumstances and you will certainly attain the mercy of the Lord.

Sometimes we have to take a little time off from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Maybe a break of a week might be good for you, so that you can read and chant nicely and do some Deity worship or something like that for one week. Then return to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service with renewed enthusiasm. If you don't really need a break, then don't take it, but if you do, then take it and return later refreshed. Do not overendeavor and push yourself too far. Do what you can and be peaceful in your service. In this way, you will never "burn out.” (October 20, 1992)

sub=Utility Is the Principle

To answer your question about distribution during colder or wetter days, I can simply say that any place that is legal, or at least not going to get you or the movement in too much trouble, and where it is possible to distribute is fine. There are no restrictions as to where you can distribute these wonderful books of Śrīla Prabhupāda. Some devotees only go to these places. It is purely a matter of taste and of legality. Sometimes it gets one in great trouble to go into these offices or shops, but in other places there is no problem at all. So you all there in Finland know your own country far better than I. Therefore, you can all decide on your own where to distribute and where not to. I am not at all qualified to say. I can simply say that you should increase the distribution more and more, since this is our main activity in spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement throughout the world under the direct order of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself. (July 16, 1988)

If a materialist gets any of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, including a <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> 5.2, he will be benefited, since these books tell about the essence of spiritual life. Even if the book is somewhat esoteric, like the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛtas</em>, for example, the person who gets the book is benefited, simply because he has touched it and paid a donation for it. This will eternally benefit them and they will get another chance to perform devotional service in the future. Therefore, any book is beneficial for the people. Better though is to give them a <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> along with a <em>Bhāgavatam</em> or <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> and then tell them that this is the introductory work and the other is the more advanced work. (November 19, 1991)

I recommend for <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees a stay in India not longer than three weeks, even if they have not been to India for five years, and in some cases, where the devotees might get sick or are liable to get spaced out, two weeks. They should only go to ISKCON temples. Prabhupāda wanted them to go to Mayapur and Vṛndāvana during the festivals and not to other places. We do not have tourism in spiritual life. They should always go under authorized programs. The best program is one week in Mayapur, one week in Vṛndāvana, and some days transiting either Bombay or Delhi. The problem is that there is a lot of possibility to not be engaged during these visits, which leads to <em>māyā</em> and, ultimately, a disruption in the sādhana, which causes a diminishing of devotional service. Is this enough information? (January 21, 1992)

It is not the best that an uninitiated devotee cooks on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. It is best that an initiated devotee does it. But if there is no other choice, then it may be all right.

It is Kṛṣṇa conscious to accept things as they come without your asking for them and also to ask the temple to supply you with something you need, if you are giving all your collection to the temple. You should live simply without too many demands for your own satisfaction. But you can also arrange with the temple president if you require something special. For example, if you want to go to India for the festival one year and you have no other means of getting a ticket, you can ask the temple president to let you keep a percentage of your collection, which is over the normal collection for the temple, or allow you to do something else which is agreeable to you both. In other words, you can always arrange special collections with the temple president, and so long as it is authorized then it is Kṛṣṇa conscious. (May 15, 1990)

It is very nice that you have understood that only the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em> is the means to free oneself from the material nature. This is a good realization.

It is all right that a new driver drives long distances, as long as she is careful in all respects and does not fall asleep while driving.

All cars should be heavily insured, in case there is an accident. A wise temple president will set aside some of the collection from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees to pay for the new cars when the old cars break down or have to be replaced. This is the duty of the temple president. The temple president might arrange that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees make a special collection just for the cars, but that is up to him. (May 15, 1990)

It is not exactly a material desire to want a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with. But I think that such a decision, whether to collect for a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van or not, should be made by your temple president. Since you are here now in Germany, you should discuss this with your temple president. I think that it is not required, and you should just depend on your authorities, wherever you are, to tell you when it is required to collect for a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van.

It is good to distribute a lot of books for the satisfaction of Lord Caitanya and the spiritual master. All spiritual authorities become pleased when you distribute a lot of books. It is not good to think that you are the doer of this service and that it is to your credit that you are distributing so many books. You should understand that it is the credit of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is actually the one who is distributing these books and all credit should go to Him. Never take credit yourself for anything that has gone on in the past, and you will live happily beyond all material desires. (September 15, 1991)

I am very glad to hear that you are dedicated to rebuilding the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission there in France. However, you should get in the practice to distribute the books for twice the BBT price, so that the temple authorities will see book distribution as a viable means of supporting the temple economically. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> is a good means to support the temple and it is the means which Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted ISKCON to use to support the temples, so you can also do like that. (May 15, 1992)

This is the material world and there is danger at every step of the way. As springtime comes and summer approaches, and as the modes of passion arise very strongly again, lust increases, after the deep modes of ignorance of late winter. This causes everyone trouble.

I think that in your letter you yourself have come up with a very nice solution to the problem which you, and perhaps others, are facing. That is, to always go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> together with others. I have also personally distributed with both methods, alone and with others. Although there is a certain type of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> ecstasy that comes when one is alone and completely depending on Kṛṣṇa, I would still prefer to go with one other. We used to perform <em>saṅkīrtana</em> on the subway trains in New York this way: one devotee on each end of the train meeting in the middle. We still do bus <em>saṅkīrtana</em> this way in South America.

There is strength in numbers. When one must go alone all the time, that is gradually weakening one. It is generally better to go with others as much as possible. If you are alone, then your mind takes over and starts to speculate. But when you are with others, it is much harder for the mind to do that, and therefore, it does not like the idea of you going with others and it rebels. Therefore, there is initially some trouble in this system. However, this can be overcome if you try to stick to it for some time. Please continue your service nicely and things will definitely get better. This seems to be a test from Kṛṣṇa, but certainly you can pass it. (May 30, 1986)

If you are happy in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, then please go on serving Kṛṣṇa in this way. Do not be disturbed with thoughts of marriage. If Kṛṣṇa wants you to get married, then He will arrange everything Himself, and you will not have to make any endeavor for it. Just go out and distribute and whatever Kṛṣṇa arranges is perfect. (November 1, 1991)

sub=Real Renunciation

I do know that the major activity for preaching in Los Angeles is book distribution. The distribution of the transcendental literature of Śrīla Prabhupāda is considered by spiritual authorities to be the highest form of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Indeed, it was the way in which you became interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness! So you can have practical realization of the potency of this mission.

Throughout the world, this movement in its various affiliated branches distributes many millions of books. This is a very big venture. Sometimes we cannot collect back the printing cost of these books, since the people of Kali are so unfortunate and impious that they cannot even see fit to properly donate enough for the books. It is obvious that because of this, some temples might be forced to subsidize their book distribution by either doing some business or perhaps by asking people to donate for other things.

Of course, such activities seen by themselves could be taken to be materialistic, but when seen in relationship to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> means of distributing books, it is a perfectly spiritual activity. Certainly such distribution, when simply done to further one's own bodily maintenance or further one's own opulences, is not very spiritual, and this type of activity is to be avoided according to the instructions of Śrīla Prabhupāda.

There is a verse in Rūpa Gosvāmī's writings that speaks about real renunciation. He says that simply renouncing something because it seems to be material is not sufficient renunciation, it is false renunciation. And after all, almost everything that we deal with in the world can be seen as material, since this world is a product of the external potency of the Lord, <em>māyā</em>. So where do you find spirit in this world of material names and forms? Through spiritual practice and advancement one can see the spiritual energy working everywhere, but when one becomes advanced, he will see that everything is usable in the service of the Lord by one with the pure spiritual motive to please. We do not use everything that exists in Kṛṣṇa's service, since there are many things that are exceedingly impure and unusable for us. But we can say that there are many things that can be used without compromising our spiritual principles.

For example, one cannot build a temple of Kṛṣṇa with good intentions only. It would be wonderful if we could simply go on the street, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and people would come forward desirous of building a temple for Kṛṣṇa, but alas, it is only a dream at this point. In this modern world of opulence and material enjoyment, if one is a spiritual beggar, he is not listened to! It is sad, I know, but that is the fact. People only stand up and take notice of you when you have something wonderful to present to them. Books are certainly the most wonderful thing, but some people are just dull and cannot appreciate them. For that class of men—perhaps eighty percent of the population, if not more—wonderful temples and dioramas are the key to bringing them closer to Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore, the best preaching program is one that nicely balances the need to distribute a mountain of transcendental literature, and the need to create wonderful temples for people to see. To this end, some temples have had to resort to other propositions rather than just straight book distribution and chanting on the street. Of course, this program is risky and perhaps some have forgotten about the books, but certainly not all. (Undated)

It is very nice that you are enthusiastic about book <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. It is the actual mission started by Śrīla Prabhupāda. Doing paraphernalia is not <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, but a business activity. Because it is helping to maintain the temple, it is also devotional service, but it is not <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Therefore, you may go on and perform your devotional service as you have been requested by your temple authorities, but always try to engage in book distribution as much as possible as well, for this is the life of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. (June 19, 1991)

sub=Farm Saṅkīrtana

Farms are not really a place for new <em>bhaktas</em> and <em>brahmacārīs</em>. Farms are meant for householders. The <em>brahmacārīs</em> and especially the <em>bhaktas</em> are meant to go to the city centers on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. This is why you are having so many troubles there. Your farm is not really what it should be. Maybe there can be some <em>brahmacārīs</em> there on the farm, but they will be the type of person who can neither do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> nor wants to. He would rather be on the farm. That is the best thing; to have on the farm only those who really want to be there. You should also have a traveling <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party that works out from the farm or from the nearest city where book distribution can take place. In this way, you can engage devotees according to their propensity. According to their qualities and activities, they should be engaged and then they can be happy. It is not good to try to push them into a certain mode of action if they are not fit for it.

So at your farm you should have a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party that travels and sells books. I think that there are enough books now to insure that they have something to distribute. All those devotees who want to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> should go on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party, and whoever doesn't want to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> should stay back and work in the temple and the farm. We would never, at least in the West, force a person who wants to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> to serve in the farm or in the temple, for that is completely against all principles of <em>varṇāśrama</em> management. Besides, it is against the principles of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> management. Since we are a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, every available man and woman, who wants to be engaged in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, should be given facility to distribute books and preach to the people.

But we should not fill our temples up with useless neophytes, who are not at all fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. We should also take some time to train the new devotees. But new devotees should be trained in a city center, not a farm. The way in which devotees should get to the farm is as follows: First a person joins in the city center. He learns from a <em>bhakta</em> program in the city and simultaneously he goes on the chanting party in the city and learns how to distribute <em>prasādam</em>, magazines, and small books with the chanting party. A little later, when he is more fixed up—perhaps in two to four months time, depending on the person—he will join the full-time <em>saṅkīrtana</em> for some years until he learns the art of preaching well. He remains on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> party for as long as he can. Perhaps later on he will want to come and work on the farm, and he can do so, after he has done his <em>saṅkīrtana</em> duty, like one must do his military duty in the <em>karmī</em> world. Also there are some who are not fit for <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. They are not good at it and some don't want to do it either. They can move to the farm right away. You see, we send people to the farm when it is seen that they cannot do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. We give everyone a chance to do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, since that is the most important service, but those who cannot do it go to the farm. This balances the population of devotees out nicely after a while, and it also makes sure that no one at the farm feels frustrated. The farm should only expand with these members of ISKCON who are voluntarily joining the farm community.

It is also possible that sometimes a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee would rather be associated with the farm than the city center. They are interested in the farm, but they would rather do <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Such devotees should go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> from the farm and return to the farm during the weekends. In this way, they can feel part of the farm community and the farm development, yet at the same time they can feel that they are part of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement, which is the most important service. (August 30, 1990)

sub=Dedication to the Mission

It is essential that you attract people to this movement not by tricks or by the force of your so-called intellect but by your pure and dedicated example. One sincere preacher is worth a hundred <em>jñānīs</em>. Please dedicate your life to spreading this movement more and more.

Never forget that the goal of this movement is to produce and distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Practically this is our most important work. This requires manpower, not just someone to fill up the <em>bhakta</em> pants, but someone who is dedicated to the mission of his spiritual master. To attract such a high quality of man, you have to yourself be the same quality. This is difficult, but well worth the struggle. (October 10, 1984)

Some devotees lose their taste for book distribution, because they have allowed their material desires to overwhelm them and they have decided to enjoy some material facility instead. This comes sometimes with age as well. When one gets older, he wants to have more material facilities. This is called material attachment. One has to conquer that with spiritual detachment attained through knowledge of devotional service as it is given by Śrīla Prabhupāda in his books.

You should not push or force anyone to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but rather convince them through the philosophy. Proper preaching about book distribution should be enough to persuade them to surrender to it nicely. You can inspire others to distribute books by doing it yourself and being happy about it. This is the best way that you can serve book distribution.

If you are on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and every day attending the morning programs, it is not always required that you attend the evening programs in the temple and it is probably better that you read as you have suggested. You must read Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and learn our philosophy completely. (March 19, 1992)

sub=How to Preach Saṅkīrtana

This point about book distribution preaching is very important. I have heard your class when you were here in Korsnäs over the speaker system. I thought it was a good class. There were some points that could be mentioned that might help you understand more about the problem of preaching in a temple about the urgency and importance of book distribution.

When you were speaking about the transferal of the books from Vṛndāvana to Navadvīpa, that was nice. It was a means by which the importance of the books could be emphasized without overdoing it. Just consider: Sometimes I very clearly speak about book distribution. I do not do it so very often, since the basis for this understanding has been nicely established in this zone.

When I do it, I do it clearly and strongly. There is no doubt what we are talking about. I usually do this when there is a need due to some degradation of the book distribution spirit. In other times, when things are going as well as could naturally be expected, I do not hammer home this point again. In fact, such overemphasizing a point can work against one.

For example, if one continuously preaches in class that one should follow the principles, gradually no one will be interested in the class since it is the same thing. Furthermore, due to the rebellious nature of the psychology of the conditioned souls, some of them might even think that they don't want to have anything to do with it. Do you understand? If there is no need to push something, then pushing it can have the exactly opposite effect than the one that is wanted.

For example, in your class you were directly pushing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> as one would normally do in a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> class. Consider the audience. There were some <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men there who already knew about the need to do it, since they were doing it already. There are also a majority of BBT devotees who do nothing but make books all day. They are not distributing the books, but making the books. This is their life and soul. Then there are a small handful of temple devotees who support everyone else and who also cannot sell books. So the point of the class, although nice, was lost on most of the people, since they were either already totally absorbed in the service or they could not do it due to supporting it.

Such devotees would like to hear about Kṛṣṇa. So it was nice that you told them the story, which was related to book distribution, yet was a pastime of the devotees of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The real point in preaching is that one has to learn how to attract someone's mind to Kṛṣṇa and then, when the person understands Kṛṣṇa's glories and can appreciate the knowledge, you gradually reveal that it is all Prabhupāda's mercy that comes from these books. Naturally, when one understands the importance of the books through study of the books, he will also want to sell the books as well. This is a natural consequence of good preaching. It is subtle in many respects, but it is more powerful, since it works on the level of intelligence. One should bring the hearers to the point of them making their own minds up about the importance of the books, rather than attempting to program them to think in that manner. I think this is what I have tried to do. Now you have to learn the art as well.

I can be much more direct among my own disciples, since this is the direct order of the spiritual master. However, you are not the <em>guru</em>; therefore, you cannot be so direct as I sometimes am. You have to be more subtle in the presentation to avoid getting anyone upset.

Speak about Kṛṣṇa, and attract people to hear about Kṛṣṇa. Naturally you will bring them also to the books. One who is totally convinced about something does not need to continuously wave it about. For him it is second nature. Be convinced yourself and sure, then there is a good chance that others will become infected with your realization. (June 27, 1988)

sub=The Real Medicine

I am in due receipt of your group letter sent on the 26th of February 1989 and thank you very much for it. You are all taking care of me so nicely. Actually, the real medicine is the distribution of literature. If you all just continue to preach and distribute these books of Śrīla Prabhupāda, then I shall definitely get better.

To be honest, I am getting better now. It will take just some months more until I am strong enough to go somewhere, but you can know it for certain that I will head straight for the Heidelberg temple, for it is my favorite place. Your devotional service is making a magnetic pull on my consciousness and surely I will come there this year. There is no doubt about it at this point.

Although I am weak and useless, I am serving Kṛṣṇa through all of you. Since you are all young and strong, I am happy just being your servant to push you onwards to greater perfection in the preaching effort. (March 21, 1989)

Now you must be fully immersed in the nectar of book distribution, and I am sure that you are getting a full taste of the nectar of Lord Caitanya's mercy. I am proud that you are my disciple, and if you just continue in this way, you will bring me back to Godhead.

The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are practically my only interest. Other things are important only as long as they relate to the support of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Therefore, please continue in this way more and more and perfect your life. (December 10, 1986)

I wanted to write a letter to you, thanking you for your dedicated service in supporting our Kṛṣṇa conscious projects here in Sweden. I am most indebted to you, and certainly Kṛṣṇa will grant you His mercy for this nice endeavor, performed without any thought of personal advantage. I do not know how to properly thank you, for you are all very serious and sincere workers. Please be satisfied with your service alone, for there are no material benedictions that could be a proper reward.

Most people are only concerned with finding some man, living in some cubicle, and rotting in the material muck of <em>māyā</em>. But you girls have transcended this lower condition. I know that sometimes you are having problems, but your dedication shows in the way that you go on in spite of that, day after day. And I would like to thank you on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. Certainly He is satisfied with you. That is perfection. (November 26, 1987)

So long as you are distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, you will be safe and happy, and I will reap the rewards of your efforts as well. Because of having such good disciples as yourself, useless fellows like myself get benefited. Your stories of the glories of distribution are very nice, and I pray to Kṛṣṇa that He empowers you more and more with His full mercy to preach. We do not care about big numbers. In the U.S.A. nowadays any number of books is big, so please go on steadily in this way, and you will never get bewildered by the tricks of the material energy. (May 21, 1988)

Actually, I do not know how to properly reciprocate with great <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees. I do not feel myself very qualified. You are all spreading Lord Caitanya's mission so nicely, and I feel myself unqualified in comparison. However, since you are my disciples, this gives me some credit, and although I am not worth much myself, I become blessed by having such nice disciples, who are spreading this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission far and wide.

I cannot think of any way to reward you. You are already being directly rewarded by Śrīla Prabhupāda, as he throws his mercy upon your heads. Please don't deviate from this principle of book distribution, and please make book distribution a grand success there in Norway. (March 31, 1988)

I am personally not very qualified as a devotee and I am full of faults; however, there are some very nice distributors in my zone who are expert in all ways. They are factually doing all the nice work of spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the zone. They are factually taking me back to Godhead. At least I hope that I will get the spiritual credit from the glorious activities of these great souls.

So you are asking me for blessings, but I am not the one who possesses the blessings, rather they are coming from those who are on the street daily, giving out the nectar to the conditioned souls. They have the blessings, so please request them to help you. Whatever little blessings I have received in my association with them, I gladly share with you, for after all, the blessings are meant for those who are actually engaged in the battle with <em>māyā</em>, not those who sit around in their offices all day engaged in so many mundane things (me). (December 10, 1989)

My initial experience with <em>saṅkīrtana</em> was on the streets of New York City, doing <em>Back to Godhead</em> magazines with the <em>harināma</em> party. This was the only form of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> at the time. Later on, I was with the old “Road Show," and we continued the sale of <em>Back to Godhead</em> on the street, as well as selling a few <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books at some programs. In the spring of 1972 I went to India, where I was engaged by Śrīla Prabhupāda in selling books through the life membership program, which I did for some time. Later on, I returned to New York for a short time and also distributed from the temple on the subways and the malls.

I have always understood from the first days on the street the extreme importance of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Without performing <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, no devotee can be happy. Real happiness comes when one is connected with Lord Caitanya by pleasing Him through the performance of the <em>saṅkīrtana-yajña</em>.

Sometimes neophyte <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees become somewhat discouraged in their service because of having insufficient knowledge as to what is the point of their service. One has to know our whole philosophy quite well and then he can understand the importance of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. It is not really an engagement for the ignorant, but is mainly meant for those who have a thorough understanding of the process of devotional service. Therefore, all your doubts and difficulties could be answered if you were to systematically study Śrīla Prabhupāda's books while you are on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. One of the reasons why the devotees in my zone are so steady on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is that they all read Śrīla Prabhupāda's books at least two hours a day, and that gives them the strength to go on in this service forever. Hear lectures by Śrīla Prabhupāda and read his books. Take shelter of those who have taken shelter of Śrīla Prabhupāda, and you will never be at a loss what to do in spiritual life.

It is a fact that your sincerity will be tested before you can attain the platform of steadiness. Sometimes Kṛṣṇa will allow you to distribute a lot in one day, and the next day, after you have profoundly congratulated yourself, you do next to nothing. This kind of up and down is a type of test given by the Lord. Initially, He will inspire you with a big success, and you may think, “Oh, this is easy!” but the very next day you will find out that it is not so easy as you thought. Actually <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is neither hard nor easy, rather it is an austerity like all services and it must be met with determination and conviction. (March 7, 1990)

title=Marathon Inspiration Letters

sub=Mad Ecstasy Marathon Message

Now it is time for the marathon, and everyone here is going completely mad in ecstasy. It is available for you as well, since you are born in the dynasty of marathon warriors. Please take the mission of liberating New York City firmly in your heart, and certainly the Lord will bless you. Please pray before Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda to empower you to distribute a lot of books yourself and to inspire others to increase. You must encourage everyone there to make their mission the liberation of New York City. The place is a den of nonsense, and <em>māyā</em> has a firm hold there. She has captured the city that belongs to Śrīla Prabhupāda and has taken it away. It is your responsibility to regain it for Kṛṣṇa and ISKCON. I have faith that you will do nicely. You have the blessings of the whole disciplic succession. Just go out and get the mercy. Just go, get it, and be happy.

The only alternative is the pit of material existence. Stay healthy and strong. Be austere and avoid nonsense useless talk. Just think, breath, talk, walk, and pray <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

sub=Letter of May 13, 1988

letter=Dear devotees of the North European Zone,

letter=Please accept my humble obeisances or blessings. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

I am writing this letter in a humble attempt to increase our desire to distribute the transcendental books of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the Founder-Ācārya of the ISKCON preaching mission. We have heard about this mission before, and we have also already directly experienced the nectar of engaging in it, but owing to the terrible condition of human society, further discussion on the urgent need to distribute books is required. Awareness of Śrīla Prabhupāda's plan to transform this sinful world through the distribution of his books is the most auspicious means to overcome the bewildering prowess of <em>māyā-śakti</em>.

If we examine the present situation of this planet, we find an absence of auspiciousness. Everywhere we look we see dull people concerned only with eating and having sex. Such persons are playthings in the hands of <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em>, the dazzling material energy, has created an arrangement by which the leaders of this world are pushing all people into an intolerable situation. Just consider the dilemma facing the present generation as they look into a future devoid of hope. Although as devotees we are well protected against the material energy, we have sufficient experience to understand the suffering of those who live within this material world, and we understand that the present condition of human society directly affects us, as we are part of the human society.

It is not only an interesting preaching point when we say that the materialists have created an intolerable situation. The air is being spoiled by defoliation of tropical rain forests and excessive exhaust fumes from factories and vehicles, the water is being polluted by unlimited chemicals, and the weather patterns are becoming most unpredictable and unfriendly. These points are documented, scientific facts. The polar ice caps are melting so fast that the sea level is rapidly changing. The instability of the earth's crust is known to all geologists, and it promises to wreck havoc without a doubt.

Furthermore the mental condition of the people is deteriorating day by day. Violent and psychotic crime is increasing. AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are laying waste to hundreds and thousands and promise to be the greatest killers of men ever. Even the Black Plague is making a comeback in some parts of the U.S.

It is becoming harder and harder than ever to even take another human birth, as the number of abortions increases exponentially. More babies are killed than are born.

The economic condition of the world, though seemingly somewhat stable, was severely rocked last year. The world economy is deteriorating at a rapid pace, and economists predict a severe crash again.

What about war, atomic weapons and the fragile world of political diplomacy that can change within a moment? How about another meltdown at a nuclear reactor? Things are obviously not stable. The only thing that one can count on is that <em>māyā</em> will continue to suppress all beings under her immense power. The mission of <em>māyā</em> is to make her mystical illusion seem like reality. Most people are eager to be cheated by her false promises, and therefore her job is a somewhat simple affair.

However obvious this is to the devotees, such realizations elude the <em>karmīs</em> eager for sense gratification. They do not want to know that their mundane existence of material enjoyment is limited by time. Such persons cannot see their impending death. Although the plain truth is directly before their eyes, they cannot see it because of their self-inflicted blindness.

Some less experienced devotees also do not understand the dangerous condition of the world. Sometimes they take shelter of some mundane economic concept and think that by making their material situation stable, their problems of life will be solved and happiness and peace will automatically follow. But those with higher intelligence understand that there will be neither peace nor freedom from the miserable conditions of material nature until one is firmly situated in the preaching mission of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Those blessed with transcendental vision, as well as those blessed with full faith in those with transcendental vision, see beyond the hopeless hankering of the material senses. They understand that no amount of material arrangements will save them from impending death. Even if the world were to come to a complete halt within a fixed period of time, they would rather die on the battlefield distributing books than rot at home praying in fear for salvation. The book distributor does not require to pray for his own protection and liberation, since these things exist as by-products of his preaching mission.

<em>Māyā</em> uses all types of subtle tricks to drag the sincere soul into illusion. Her most formidable weapon is the opposite sex. By waving the form of illusory attachment before the eyes of the sincere searcher for the Absolute Truth, she manages to divert his attention to other fields of action that have no value for saving the world. Bound by affection for wife, children, home, and the rest, a man cannot find his way past his own economic necessities, for it is not an easy task to support the ever-expanding domain of family affairs.

Beware of Cupid's sharp arrows, which become more powerful in the springtime. Steady yourself against the attack of lust by becoming determined to engage in Śrīla Prabhupāda's preaching mission.

We have seen that illusions created by lust cause book distribution to diminish. Since the conditioned souls of the late 1980's are more immersed in ignorance than ever before, new candidates for spiritual perfection are hard to find. Pressing down the slightly inquisitive seeker of knowledge through demoniac propaganda supported by sinful governments, <em>māyā</em> prevents the new influx of fresh troops to do battle against her. The older forces have fallen victim to <em>māyā's</em> allurements in the form of household life, and the emphasis turns to ward comfortable living within the <em>varṇāśrama</em> context rather than the austerity and renunciation required to push on the preaching mission.

Of course, it is easy to say that no one wants to join an austere movement. One could try to make a case that people will only join a perfectly comfortable village arrangement. However, we have not seen this happen anywhere in the world. Although occasionally some family will join a farm community, most new devotees still come through the austere preaching centers. Usually the farm communities are composed of older devotees who have found their niche in life there. Although nothing is wrong with that, and it is probably good for them, a severe problem arises when the number of devotees engaged in non-saṅkīrtana activities is far larger than the number engaged in distribution.

I have concluded that all our endeavors at perfecting the living accommodations for our members has not made an increase in the success of our preaching efforts. Indeed, the preaching mission seems to have rapidly diminished proportionate to the increase of material facility. Opulence seems to be contrary to the revealed principles of Lord Caitanya's mission of <em>vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga</em>. After all, one can get a comfortable situation within the material world, therefore there is no need to join ISKCON just to become comfortable. Maybe comfort is a factor for some people, but most come to us because they require a comfortable spiritual atmosphere, a real shelter from the scorching fire of material nature.

According to observable reality, those places that are still inspired to distribute books are still alive and well, but those places that have been diverted into other areas of activity are plagued with problems. One could conclude from such observations that the austerity and renunciation found in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, when combined with the development of the transcendental knowledge found in our books, form a solid basis for long-term development and success in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

When we engage in the book distribution mission, even if only for a short time, we capture the transcendental energy  that flows from the mercy river emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord. Although we may have other engagements, and some of us shall, since every temple requires <em>pūjārīs</em>, cooks, managers, and so on, if the mood of the temple is based on the desire to expand the preaching mission, the temple will grow and prosper.

If the temple is supported by the efforts of the book distributors, then automatically book distribution is seen as the life and soul of the temple's existence. Naturally the temple managers will want as many book distributors as possible. In any case, our temple managers have to become first-class leaders of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. The temple president does not merely delegate this responsibility to some <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader and forget about it. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> leaders may be there, but the temple president in tune with the beautiful harmony vibrating from the Lord's <em>bṛhad-mṛdaṅga</em> will never allow this most important service to be taken away from him. The temple president is the most important <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader, for through his managerial efforts, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is supported.

But the purpose of this letter is not only to push the temple president to lead the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement but also to increase the awareness of each devotee within the temple. We are, after all, a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. This means that the movement is based on and supported by <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> means chanting congregationally and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books. The preaching mission is the mission of this movement. Each devotee must accept that mission in his heart if he desires success in spiritual life.

Unless we accept this mission in our hearts, and unless we make the mission of our spiritual master our mission, we cannot conquer over that most clever enemy of spiritual advancement, <em>māyā-śakti</em>. Many have tried to brave the onslaughts of <em>māyā</em> while meditating on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, and most have fallen within the first moments of the fight. Even if you are not able to engage one hundred percent on the front lines of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, still you should make it your life and soul to support that mission by all means.

Everyone can support the mission of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. Feed a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, make him a beadbag, give him nice clothing, or praise him with fitting words, for he is a hero. Show your support by assisting him in his work. Go out yourself and taste the nectar first hand. You do not have to sit in your corner, internally lamenting over your inability to be part of the direct preaching. Get out the door and help the people of this world.

There is no other means to help people than to give them the holy name of the Lord, <em>kṛṣṇa-prasādam</em> and, above all, a book (or a set!). What will an introductory talk do compared with a hard-bound piece of literature? Give them <em>prasādam</em>. Get them to chant. But when you give them a book, it is complete victory for Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda.

Now we are realizing that the book distribution results have diminished over previous years. In fact, they are on the same level as 1986, when everyone went to the festival and stayed there, though their bodies seemingly returned.

Usually at times like this I would beat the <em>mṛdaṅga</em> drum of book distribution loudly in all the temple halls, crying, “Wake up, O warriors. Now is not the time to rest while the forces of <em>māyā</em> are laying waste to the remaining preaching fields.” This year I am a victim of my body. Shot and wounded on the battlefield when I wasn't looking, I remain in the background, trying to encourage the troops with these words. Please take up this mission with all determination. There is no other mission that even comes close to being as important. It is the only way to prevent total chaos in an already chaotic world. Please take this seriously and distribute books.

I hope this meets you all well and eager to distribute the mercy.

letter=My dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes and heroines of East Germany,

letter=Please accept my blessings. You are all doing so nicely there on the marathon. I am very pleased with all of you. Śrīla Prabhupāda is more pleased with all of you; and above all, Lord Caitanya is very pleased with all of you. To please these personalities is the perfection of life.

Please go on pleasing them more and more, and make your lives fully perfect in this very lifetime. When you become completely perfect through this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, then you will hear the lotus flute of the Lord inviting you back to His spiritual abode within a short time. We do not expect that this will come very soon, but even if we have to wait until we are old, still the ecstasy of attaining the lotus feet of the Lord is worth the wait. We can tolerate anything if ultimately we are going to attain the lotus feet of the Lord.

This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is the life and soul of the devotees. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that he had no problems, as long as he could hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. When he chanted, he started to float in the ocean of nectar and could easily step beyond the ocean of material suffering. His only concern was for the fools and rascals in the material world, who are without the understanding of the mercy of the Lord. He is thinking of them in love and wants to help them out of their suffering condition. You are all working in that mood of love for the conditioned souls, so please just go on until every last one of them has been approached with the transcendental mercy in the form of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. This will be the perfection of life.

I hope this meets you well and happy in your divine mission.

sub=Letter of December 15, 1991

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees of the German <em>yātrā</em>,

letter=Please accept my blessings. It is a great honor that I am able to address you all today. You are doing the highest welfare work for the people of your country. This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is the only hope for the people of this world. Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no way that people's lives can become auspicious. Lord Caitanya has guaranteed that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and especially the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, is the highest benediction on the suffering humanity.

Just see how the people of Eastern Germany are so frustrated with material life! They have become mad with material desires, and they are completely frustrated that they cannot enjoy their senses to their full satisfaction. This is a good thing for us in one sense, because it will create an atmosphere in which the young people will come to us out of desperation in search of peace and happiness. Therefore, we should not give up our preaching in East Germany, since the young people are just in the proper stage to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those in distress and those in need of wealth are also candidates for surrendering to Kṛṣṇa if they are pious. Of course, hardly anyone is pious in that place, otherwise what are they doing there? But we can still take advantage of the situation and take the cream of the country and turn them into dedicated <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and women if we sincerely preach and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness there. And there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books.

This mission is eternal. It is going on throughout the history of the universe in some place or other at all times. The <em>ācāryas</em> are constantly preaching this mission and the Lord is always eager that the innocent people get the opportunity to surrender to His lotus feet. Sometimes the preaching mission is more obviously successful than other times, and even sometimes the preaching mission seems to disappear owing to the strong influence of the material nature, but a great <em>ācārya</em>, like Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, appears to reestablish the preaching mission. Therefore, we are very fortunate to be followers of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda and his descendants, like Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Śrīla Prabhupāda dedicated his whole life to writing and publishing his books. Naturally, after the publishing of a book, the next stage is to distribute that book in a large scale throughout the world. We are real followers of Śrīla Prabhupāda when we distribute his books on a large scale.

We are not fruitive. Even if we are not able to distribute as many books as last year because the people in the former DDR are becoming westernized to some extent, still there is nothing to lament about. Our business is to distribute the books as much as we can without considering the results. We may be doing more or less than before, but that does not matter. What matters is that we are doing as much as possible in a sincere manner. Even if we are not so sincere, if we are doing as many books as we can, Kṛṣṇa will be happy, Prabhupāda will be happy, and we will be happy too! Work without fruitive desires, since that is the means of success. You should know that there is no better way to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through this book distribution. We want to please Prabhupāda, and this is the way to do it. Whether you are selling fifty or five hundred books a day, just go out with full enthusiasm, knowing well that your service satisfies the disciplic succession. There is nothing better than this activity. There are so many things in this world that one can do at any given point in time, but of all activities, book distribution and preaching are the best. So let us go on preaching more and more with enthusiasm and become happy in the highest of all transcendental services. Kṛṣṇa will recognize you for your austerity, especially since it is getting a little tougher there, as the people are becoming more crazy than normal. Do not be afraid; Kṛṣṇa will protect you. Although there are severe tests, just consider that because of your <em>karma</em> you should have been killed, but by Kṛṣṇa's grace there were only some small cuts. Just offer your obeisances again and again to Kṛṣṇa, and liberation will become your rightful claim.

Even twenty years ago, no one could imagine that so many books could be distributed in such a short time. This activity goes beyond all material expectations. It is strictly on the spiritual platform, without a tinge of material inebriety. So just continue with this service and become perfect in this life and gradually attain your spiritual bodies as eternal associates of the Supreme Lord in Goloka Vṛndāvana. This is the end goal of all <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

I pay my <em>daṇḍavats</em> to all the sincere <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees of ISKCON.

All glories to you!

sub=Letter of December 12, 1992

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees,

letter=Please accept my blessings or respects, and dear Rohiṇīsuta Prabhu, please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Materially speaking, this year is one of the worst. Even the Queen of England said, “<em>Annus horribilis</em>.” This year is horrible. Things are breaking down everywhere, and the dream of a better decade after the fall of communism is fast dissipating everywhere. Economies are stagnating and going into recession, social life is becoming more and more complex, and hatred between people is increasing at each step. War is commonplace and has even returned to Europe in what was Yugoslavia, while the rest of the world braces itself for the next major agitation. Presently there are riots throughout India over pseudo-religious issues, which were created by politicians to increase their power and prestige. AIDS is rampant and there is no cure in sight. There is no peace between people. Even devotees are feeling the pinch, as deviant behavior shocks us into remembering that the material world is not our permanent home.

Looking over the world situation, and considering the situation in ISKCON today, I can only understand one point. There is no hope for the world today unless we distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books far and wide. People in the West are too crazy to listen peacefully to a lecture on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Indeed, they will not even come! Some may hear, and that is good, but the masses miss the opportunity because they are too unfortunate. But you great souls—you <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes—you go out every day and give these people hope. You do not care for your own comforts, and despite personal difficulties you are dedicated to bringing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books to every door and in every hand on all the streets of the world.

My obeisances to you from all directions! How wonderful it is to be in the association of such great souls. I wish that I could be there with you today, for this would be the best means of personal purification. But alas, here I remain captured by the flu, eating pills, drinking teas and juices, and pouring drops of esoteric substances down my parched throat. Ah, the fever of the flu is nothing compared to the fever of material existence, which has me firmly in her grips. Someday I shall be fortunate enough to always have the association of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and get freed from the constant headache of problems, which are mounting day by day as the Kali-yuga progresses in all respects.

What benediction can I offer you? Kṛṣṇa Himself did not attempt to offer the <em>gopīs</em> any benedictions, because He knew that they would not accept them. The <em>gopīs</em> serve Kṛṣṇa out of love only, and they never are interested in anything in return for that love. This is selfless love in action. Similarly, you devotees are selflessly going out and distributing love of Godhead without any concern for payment in the form of material benefits or benedictions. Indeed, you are not even interested in liberation! Who can understand your deep realizations? Even Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are aware of the intense austerities of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and are broadcasting their glories throughout the three worlds.

Never before in history has there been such a movement to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world in so short a period of time. You are part of history in the making. You are actually present when this great movement is making itself known in Europe, where people are dull, ignorant, foolish, envious, and vicious. If we examine these people, we will see that there are few with any good qualities at all, but now and then you meet someone who you know just requires a little push to become inspired to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Such a meeting inspires you to go on distributing, for seeing the results before your eyes inspires you to keep on releasing these rays of mercy over the darkened skies of Europe. May you always be successful in your attempts to open their darkened eyes and awaken them from their long sleep on the lap of <em>māyā</em>.

“Go on marching, O spirit soul, on the path to the spiritual goal.” Yes. What else is there to do but <em>saṅkīrtana</em>? Nothing, of course, for this movement is based on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is its primary weapon. Sometimes you meet such nice people that you have to take their names and addresses. The preachers will put these names and addresses in a data base and start to contact these people as they can. Through our preaching programs and by inviting people to our many centers, people can gradually become connected to ISKCON and develop their Kṛṣṇa consciousness in action by becoming a donor and supporting a center. They perform <em>karma-yoga</em>, giving up the results of their work for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa.

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> takes place on the front lines, where direct contact with the living entity is made and his first commitment to Kṛṣṇa consciousness is planted as he purchases a book from the enthusiastic representative of God, who stands before him on a desolate street.

As the wind whips through the alleys and catches a piece of paper here and there, the last rays of the sun wash horizontally down the street. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee adjusts his cap and tightens his belt, as he prepares to meet the material nature head on in a ferocious battle, just as Kṛṣṇa adjusted His belt before battling Aghāsura in Vṛndāvana. What comparison is there between the streets of Berlin, Stockholm, or Moscow and the transcendental realm of Gokula Vṛndāvana? We cannot find any similarity by looking with material eyes. But if we understand with the heart of a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, we can feel the spiritual energy surging through us as we float down the street hand in hand with the Lord, who also is driving our chariot within the heart and guiding us to people who are willing to take their share of the stockpile of love of Godhead in the form of these transcendental books. Because of the devotee's connection with the Lord, the streets, although dark and disturbed, become a place of bliss. The devotee is not at all in anxiety, for he has the connection to the source of all power and potency, Kṛṣṇa.

What more can I say? Just be satisfied in yourselves, knowing well that you are engaged in the most important service for the sake of the millions of suffering people in this world. Do not be fooled by any ideas born of self-interest; <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is the means to please the Lord. Our strength is born of our conviction that this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is the topmost. Just perform this mission with enthusiasm, intelligence, conviction, and determination, and clear out the piles of material problems that crowd into our consciousness through the influence of <em>māyā</em>.

Pray to Kṛṣṇa for strength, and He shall certainly respond. Know it for sure that you are in the best hands.

I hope this meets you in the best of health and highest spirits.

sub=Letter of January 6, 1993

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees of the CIS,

letter=Please accept my blessings or respects.

I am very pleased to address you on this day when you are all meeting in Moscow after the most successful marathon ever performed by any country in the history of ISKCON. You have exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. All glories to you all, who are so wonderfully executing the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They must be so pleased with all of you. We cannot even imagine how pleased they are, but if you continue to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the CIS by distributing so many books like you are presently doing (and what to speak of increasing the distribution even more!), it is certain that you will become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious in this lifetime and attain the personal association of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote to the German devotees in 1977, “Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of these books." This means that although other methods of preaching are effective, and they must go on, the most effective and important means of preaching is through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Śrīla Prabhupāda also wrote to me in 1976 that he considered that the preaching in Poland would be a great success because I was distributing his books to the people there. And we have seen that the preaching was a success and is growing more and more because they are also distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books with enthusiasm.

Please be satisfied by distributing these books. This work is our life's mission. If we can flood the CIS with these transcendental books, we can completely change the mentality of the people from materialism to spiritualism. Prabhupāda said that if even one percent of the world's population takes up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the whole world can change. Therefore, we have to continually preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness by all means and methods to bring these people to the transcendental platform. So let the primary preaching go on unlimitedly in the form of the transcendental distribution of these books. Be happy distributing these books, for there is no other service that can make you as free and satisfied.

Sometimes we think of material things and become absorbed in ideas of sense gratification. But these ideas are merely mental concoctions that cannot help us attain happiness. Happiness, according to the material calculation, does not exist in truth; rather, it is a mental concoction that lasts for a short amount of time before the concomitant miseries of the material nature begin. Such happiness is only a short filling between the layers of misery. Who can be happy in this material world? The people of the CIS thought that they would be happy if they changed their system, but the miseries of the material world have remained. Until they change their hearts and accept Kṛṣṇa into their lives, they will never be able to get out of the various miserable conditions that will continue to haunt them until death.

Let us become perfectly happy by engaging ourselves in the devotional service of the Lord with all our hearts and souls. Let us devote ourselves to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission with all enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the first quality favorable for the increase of devotional service. Let the enthusiasm you now feel after this successful marathon push you forward into the year 1993, so that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> can continue with full force into the future. Actually we are on a twenty-year marathon, and we have completed one year of it. There is no cessation of this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission; it will go on increasingly as time goes by.

Utilize your youthful lives to push out these books in greater and greater quantities. We are young now, and we have the energy to make this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission work. As time goes by the body grows older, and this can cause (in the conditioned soul) a decrease in the energy available for distributing books. Therefore, just go on distributing books more and more while you have a young form. It will be to your eternal credit. When you eventually face the Lord, He will remark, “Ah, you are a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee!” The Lord loves to associate with His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

Go on regularly hearing and chanting nicely sixteen rounds of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, following the four regulative principles, and coming to the programs in the temple. And then, with great strength and enthusiasm, distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books more and more. This is the perfection of life.

May Śrīla Prabhupāda bless you. May Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu bless you, as well as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the most merciful consort of the Lord. Please go on serving the Lord in this way and become perfect in your preaching mission. Thank you for allowing me to associate with you all. I shall become purified in your association. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

I hope this meets you in good health and a happy serving mood.

sub=Letter of December 12, 1994

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes of the North European Zone,

letter=Please accept my blessings or humble obeisances. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda, who has so mercifully given us the yearly transcendental marathon through his divine inspiration. May Śrīla Prabhupāda's books be distributed far and wide to all the corners of the earth during this ecstatic marathon season.

Once again you are all gathered together in the middle of the Prabhupāda Marathon. The year is 1994, but it could be any year at any time. The service is timeless and therefore does not have the characteristics of time, place, or circumstance. Book distribution does not depend on any material situation. Although it is sometimes helped by some external conditions, such as the collapse of communism in 1990–91, we can see that ultimately the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is gradually increasing throughout the world. Our only mission is to accept this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service with a full heart, convinced that this is the proper means to save the fallen conditioned souls.

The people of this world are disturbed. I have just seen on COM the results of a poll taken in the U.S.A. More than sixty percent of the people there think that soon there will be a huge catastrophe and massive destruction. Although we are not concerned with such opinions because we know that Kṛṣṇa will protect us under all circumstances, it is interesting that people are somehow aware that they are sinful and that they will have to pay the price for their crimes. Everyone knows that this modern life of material lust and greed cannot continue; it must soon come crashing down. They can see this, but still they cannot change their long-standing habits because their hearts are hardened by all their harsh and cruel activities.

Even the so-called pious persons who profess a particular kind of religion kill and eat animals daily or kill children in the womb. The modern society has neatly tucked the horrible scene of animals being slaughtered and children being murdered “out of sight, out of mind.” Therefore people think that nothing is wrong with these activities. When they worry about sinful reactions, they are not very clear about which reactions will create their pain. They only understand that the pain will come, without considering the bona fide process to alleviate this pain and cure the root cause of material disease.

The time is ripe in the world. People are ready for Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. If they get them and read them, they will find spiritual solutions to the problems of the world. Everyone can see that from spiritual darkness this world is suffocating. We have to present these books to the people, so that they can get a taste of higher knowledge descending from the spiritual platform. This taste is transcendental and has to be cultivated for many lives. However, Śrīla Prabhupāda has written his books so that even a dull-headed person can see the beauty of his words and the pristine relevance of his purports.

Now is the time to act. Now we must distribute these books with greater and greater enthusiasm. Sometimes we think that someone else can distribute these books and we should rather do some economic development to make our old age peaceful and happy. But this is a selfish idea, which also doesn't always work. It is not sure that you will be an economic success, especially when you do not work for the betterment of our Kṛṣṇa conscious society. A Kṛṣṇa conscious society is the key to correcting the problems of this world, the books are the basis of this correction, and the time to distribute them is now.

Do not wait. You are only growing older and older each day. The body breaks down and gets weaker as you get older, and you cannot distribute with the same enthusiasm, although in Russia, a few ladies in their late sixties still distribute like anything. In any case, we should use the energy we have now to perform the most important welfare activity of all, the distribution of the books of the most blessed Founder-Acārya of ISKCON, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda.

What more needs be said? We know within our hearts that this book distribution mission is most relevant and essential. We know that the time is ripe and that we have nothing else to do than to distribute these books. We know that this is the way to get the mercy from Śrīla Prabhupāda and his devoted followers. We know that the people need this mercy more than ever before. And we know that they will take these books if we are Kṛṣṇa conscious and determined in our mission. Actually they want these books, but they just don't know that because of ignorance.

The Supersoul is within the heart of each person you meet. The Supersoul is telling them (unless they are demons), “Take this book. It is good for you. You will like it.” We merely have to appeal to the Lord within their hearts and attract them to His words and it will even be easy to get them to take a full set. It is an art, and we only have to learn this art. We only have to understand a few helpful hints from the <em>mahā-rathī</em> distributors and adapt these hints to our own style of distribution, and then everything will go easily. The books will fly out of our hands into the waiting hands of the people we meet.

Do not fear. There is nothing to fear in this world except ignorance, and every devotee is far beyond the realm of darkness because of being illuminated by the teachings of the Lord in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Śrīla Prabhupāda has presented Kṛṣṇa's words in such an attractive manner that the mind of every devotee is linked to the Lord. Now we have to go out and meet these people with confidence, knowing that we are well equipped with all the spiritual paraphernalia required to distribute these books. We have the knowledge, we have the strength, we have the mercy, we have the confidence, and we have the conviction that this is the best thing to do. What more do we need? Just go out and make your lives a success, and be happy.

And remember to bless me with the dust of your lotus feet during the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> festival at the end of December. Thank you all very much for allowing me to address you with these few words of encouragement. Although I am very low and fallen, I take strength in these opportunities to address the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees during this most important time. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

I hope this meets you well, happy, and fully absorbed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

sub=On the Occasion of the Middle of the Saṅkīrtana Marathon, December 1995

letter=“Books are the basis<br />Preaching is the essence<br />Utility is the principle<br />Purity is the force"<br />

letter=—Śrīla Prabhupāda

These words stand as a tribute to Śrīla Prabhupāda's genius. Prabhupāda understood the meaning of words in a very deep manner, and he knew how to convey these meanings in well-considered and well-constructed sentences. I remember when Prabhupāda once told me, “My writing is not like your typing, simply moving your fingers here and there. I have to choose every word carefully, for these books will last for the next 10,000 years.” I had often listened to Prabhupāda dictating his books in the middle of the night when I would wake up from sleep in the room next to his. Usually his words came flowing out, but sometimes he would stop and think about the exact word that would represent his intention best. Prabhupāda was always in the mood of presenting his books for the understanding of the people of this world, and therefore he always endeavored to pick the proper words to convey the deep concepts that make up our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava philosophy. The most amazing thing is that although most of the people who buy these books and appreciate them have little or no understanding of their deep philosophical content, the devotees, who understand the philosophy, are also fully satisfied by reading his books. How could he have written in such a way that both the neophytes (or less) and the adepts could appreciate what he was saying? Certainly this indicates his remarkable genius, such as is hardly found in modern society.

Let us therefore examine the four lines beginning with the words “Books are the basis.” Although these lines are short, they are powerful like the <em>Vedānta-sūtras</em> of Vedavyāsa. Everything one needs to know to participate in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement according to Śrīla Prabhupāda's desire is included in these four lines. I thought it helpful to seek out the dictionary meanings of the essential words in these four principles and examine these meanings in the light of what Śrīla Prabhupāda has taught us.

subsub=Books Are the Basis

Everyone knows what books are. In all the different languages of the world, millions of books are produced every year. Almost one hundred percent of these books are <em>grāmya-kathā</em>, or subject matters dealing with family, society, nation, or mundane love. Śukadeva Gosvāmī has said that a materialist has thousands of subject matters to speak about, all of them dealing with the home and family, directly or indirectly. We have practical experience that the local bookstore rarely has anything to offer to a devotee, outside of some relevant technical manuals.

But Prabhupāda's books are a different creation. They are translations of the most important books in the universe. Vyāsadeva himself has said of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> that there is no need of any other book, for <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> presents the essence of spiritual philosophy. And we all know the importance of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, since it was directly spoken by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. All of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books represent the quintessence of spiritual philosophy and can thus offer the greatest benediction to the people of this world.

How could we live without Śrīla Prabhupāda's books? What would there be to read? What would we have to think about? What would we say in class? We would certainly be lost in the whirlpool of mental speculation were we not to have these most beautiful renditions of the greatest literature known to man. Therefore we can do nothing else than glorify these books and the most merciful personality who has taken the edge of the highest category. Second, the distributor is not an ordinary person. He is a person who studies the books regularly and lives according to the principles in them. He is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.

But how are the people to understand this? It is therefore essential that the devotee present the books in a way that the people can understand the immediate difference between these books and the ordinary literature meant for crows. The persons these books are meant for are like swans, who inhabit lakes filled with clear water and lotus flowers, and ordinary books are attractive to crows, who inhabit heaps of filthy garbage. The prime duty of the devotee distributing books is to instill within the prospective purchaser the idea that these books are special. If the person can understand somehow or other that these books are completely different from the material variety, and that the purchase of these books marks a turning point in one's humdrum life of material, so-called pleasures, then he will purchase them without delay.

It is clear that Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are the most important books in the world and that distribution of these books is the most important service one can perform in ISKCON today. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that “Books are the basis.” What did he mean by "basis”?

Here is what the Compton's Dictionary has to say about the word:

<strong>ba·sis</strong> <em>n.</em>, <em>pl.</em> <strong>ba·ses</strong> 1. the base, foundation, or chief supporting factor of anything; 2. the principal constituent of anything; 3. the fundamental principle or theory, as of a system of knowledge.

These three primary definitions of the word "basis” clearly indicate what Prabhupāda meant when he said, “Books are the basis.” Books are the base, the foundation, and chief supporting factor of ISKCON, and distributing these books is the fundamental principle in ISKCON. This is very clear. We do not need to speculate to understand what he meant, for the <em>mukhya-vṛtti</em>, or the direct dictionary definitions of the words used, clearly determine the import of his statement. Simply speaking, books are the very base upon which ISKCON is built.

We often speak about ISKCON as a house. But do we really understand the foundation of this house? Sometimes a foundation is overlooked by people enamored by the way the upper stories of a house appear. Even a flag hanging outside the front entrance draws more attention and discussion than the foundation, which is factually the support of the existence of the house.

If the flag were not there, would it matter so much? But if the foundation were not there, the house could not exist. Of course, a house is a combination of many elements, all of them important in their own way. But every engineer knows that a house is only so solid as the foundation upon which it is built. One may have a beautiful house, complete with all the decorations and fanfare, but if the foundation is rotten, the house is worthless and will soon come tumbling down.

Some devotees do not appreciate the function of book distribution in ISKCON. Granted that many do, there are some who take it lightly and do not care about this essential activity. Then again, there are some devotees who only care about this activity and do not care about other forms of devotional service. Neither attitude is healthy, nor is such a lack of understanding of the complete picture in ISKCON good for the preaching mission. One should appreciate all the devotees' services and understand how they work together to advance the preaching mission. But one should never forget that basis upon which the whole of ISKCON stands, without which we would be lost—the books.

Whenever someone asked Śrīla Prabhupāda where he got the money to do his various projects, he would immediately answer, “We are selling <em>lakhs</em> [hundreds of thousands] of our books every day!” He was very pleased to say that to doubters. He was proud of his books' sales figures and his booksellers. That is not to say he didn't appreciate the other services the devotees performed, not at all, but he would emphasize the book distribution because he knew that it was essential to the development of his movement. Indeed, all the projects constructed in India would not have been possible without the help of the BBT, which gets its money through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

So it is clear that books are certainly important, and we should never forget this in our devotional lives. All managers of all temples should see to it that book distribution is going on in their areas, at least to some degree, and they should be eager, at least within their hearts, to expand that distribution more and more according to their means. And we should pray regularly to the Deities and Śrīla Prabhupāda to send us more <em>saṅkīrtana</em> warriors, so that we can increase the distribution of these wonderful books more and more.

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees understand the importance of their mission. They so much desire to hear about this mission that they speak about it and read about it regularly. Sometimes devotees think that they are missing something by not taking part in all the other aspects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and just distributing books, but we have seen that <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have no trouble learning any art required for preaching and management later on when it is desired. If the basis is there, everything else comes automatically. Therefore one should go on distributing these books with great enthusiasm, for this will support the ISKCON society with everything it needs to expand, grow, and become more and more influential in the world.

subsub=Preaching Is the Essence

The next <em>sūtra</em> of Śrīla Prabhupāda's is “Preaching is the essence.” We all know what it means to preach. As Śrīla Prabhupāda himself said to the German devotees in 1976, “Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of my books.” This immediately tells us what the best means of preaching is. Therefore the book distributors are always engaged in the topmost preaching mission. Śrīla Prabhupāda also said, “What is the use of your two minutes of preaching? The person will hear and go away. But if he takes a book he is eternally benefited.” Therefore every book distributor should know that when he distributes one of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, he is bringing Prabhupāda directly into the homes of the people. Prabhupāda is directly preaching to these fallen conditioned souls. And who is a better preacher than Prabhupāda? Therefore book distribution is the best way to preach.

But there are other ways to preach as well. Prabhupāda was not small-minded and narrow. He wanted all forms of preaching to go on, for he saw that different devotees have different inclinations to preach, and he encouraged all of them according to their desires. Once, in South Africa, I mentioned to Śrīla Prabhupāda that I liked to do large programs of chanting and distributing <em>prasādam</em>. Prabhupāda immediately replied, "Then do it all over the world!” I was very pleased to hear that instruction. Prabhupāda always wanted to encourage everyone in their particular desire to preach. All kinds of preaching are required, for this is a big world and there are many fallen souls. Let all the preaching programs go on simultaneously, for they will benefit each other and ultimately ISKCON will benefit.

Prabhupāda states in the purport to <em>Madhya-līlā</em>, Chapter Twenty-four, text 205 of the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, “Everyone is eligible to become Kṛṣṇa's devotee. One simply has to be trained according to the approved process. It is the work of Kṛṣṇa's confidential devotees to turn everyone into a <em>kṛṣṇa-bhakta</em>. If the confidential devotees do not take up the task of elevating everyone to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then who will do it? Those who claim to be devotees but do not engage in Kṛṣṇa's service to elevate all living creatures to Kṛṣṇa consciousness are to be considered <em>kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs</em> (people in the lowest stage of devotional service). When one rises to the second platform of devotional service, his business is to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. Those who are active in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should not remain in the neophyte stage but should rise to the platform of preachers, the second platform of devotional service. Devotional service is so enchanting that even the first-class devotees (<em>uttama-adhikārīs</em>) also come down to the second platform to preach and render service to the Lord for the benefit of the whole world.”

Preaching can be done through distributing books or by lecturing in the temples. Preaching can be done in schools, through printed materials, on the radio or TV, or through <em>harināmas</em>. You can preach to a guest who visits the temple or even to people you meet on the street. You just have to follow Lord Caitanya's advice:

quote=yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br />āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa

"Wherever you go, whoever you meet, tell them about Kṛṣṇa. In this way become a <em>guru</em> and deliver your country.” It is not difficult to become a <em>guru</em>. All you have to do is speak exactly what Kṛṣṇa has spoken, as you have heard it from your spiritual master. Then you are instructing people in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thus you are their teacher.

Everyone understands how important preaching is. As Prabhupāda used to say, "One who has life, he can preach.” Once he said, “Without this preaching, there will be no more 'Hari Hari bol.” Preaching puts you on the transcendental platform. It brings you beyond the influence of the miserable conditions of material life. It is the life of all knowledge. One cannot even remember what he has read in Śrīla Prabhupāda's books unless he preaches it to others. When we read and preach then the knowledge becomes quickly realized and we remember it better.

But Prabhupāda said more than this. Although everything we have mentioned so far is correct, Prabhupāda has used the word “essence.” This word has very deep meanings and should be examined further. The dictionary has the following to say about the word:

<strong>es·sence</strong> <em>n.</em> 1. something that is, or exists; entity; 2. that which makes something what it is; intrinsic, fundamental nature or most important quality (of something); essential being; 3. a) a substance that keeps, in concentrated form, the flavor, fragrance, or other properties of the plant, drug, food, etc. from which it is extracted; essential oil; 4. Philos. a) the inward nature of anything, underlying its manifestations; true substance; b) the indispensable conceptual characteristics and relations of anything.

Just see how these dictionary definitions clearly expand the meaning of the phrase "Preaching is the essence.” First of all, by preaching one exists. This could be defined as existing in the vision of Kṛṣṇa; in other words, one who preaches becomes recognized by <em>guru</em> and Kṛṣṇa and receives their mercy. Further, when you preach you can also remain a devotee. It is hard to stay fixed up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless you have some connection to preaching. Preaching is what makes Kṛṣṇa consciousness what it is, that is to say, it brings the life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to a devotee, who then becomes absorbed in transcendental devotional service. It is the fundamental principle of ISKCON, the essential element that distinguishes ISKCON from the other societies in the world today. The specific quality of Prabhupāda's ISKCON is that it is above and beyond anything else a preaching movement. We are not interested in being a movement of idle armchair speculators who are unconcerned with the sufferings of the people of the world. Therefore the essential ingredient in ISKCON that makes it what it is, is the preaching that we do by the very nature and structure of ISKCON. In other words, ISKCON is meant to be a preaching movement, and therefore all managerial arrangements should be directed toward preaching and supporting the preaching.

subsub=Utility Is the Principle

<strong>util·i·ty</strong> <em>n</em>. 1. the quality or property of being useful; usefulness; 2. something useful; adj. 1. serving or designed for practical use with little or no attention to beauty 2. useful or used in a number of ways.

Prabhupāda used to say, “Do the needful.” Whatever was required to spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was considered needful and something that should be done. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also said that things favorable to Kṛṣṇa consciousness are to be accepted while things unfavorable are to be rejected. When Prabhupāda used the word "utility,” he referred to the quality of a thing or action useful to the spreading of the preaching mission. Prabhupāda was a very practical person. He had the most extraordinary sense of what was relevant at a particular time, place, and circumstance. Therefore, he utilized everything according to its usefulness for the preaching. And this was the principle he followed.

<strong>prin·ci·ple</strong> <em>n</em>. 1. the ultimate source, origin, or cause of something; 2. a natural or original tendency, faculty, or endowment; 3. a fundamental truth, law, doctrine, or motivating force, upon which others are based [moral principles); 4. a) a rule of conduct, esp. of right conduct; b) such rules collectively; c) adherence to them; integrity; uprightness [a man of principle]; 5. an essential element, constituent, or quality, esp. one that produces a specific effect [the active principle of a medicine].

Prabhupāda considered utility so important that he called it our “principle.” Therefore it is a fundamental truth in our movement that we do whatever is required to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One vivid example of this is something that happened when we were in Mauritius with Śrīla Prabhupāda in the southern hemisphere winter of 1975, trying to secure visas and a means to enter South Africa, which was then following the policy of apartheid. We were discussing how to enter the country. At that time Śrīla Prabhupāda said that if it were necessary to enter the country in civilian clothes, he would be willing to do that. I had never seen Śrīla Prabhupāda wearing anything but a <em>dhotī</em>, but he was so eager to preach to the fallen souls of South Africa that he was willing to wear <em>karmi</em> clothes to enter the country. Although he ultimately did not have to do that and they accepted him in his <em>sādhu</em> dress while we entered separately in <em>karmi</em> clothes, still he made clear the point that preaching was the essence and utility the principle, and therefore he was ready to do something unusual for the sake of the mission.

Prabhupāda often showed this in his early days of establishing ISKCON. For example, never before were women allowed to live in the <em>āśramas</em> of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Generally they would live at home with their husbands and family, or if they were to have an <em>āśrama</em>, it would be separated physically from the male <em>āśramas</em>. Prabhupāda knew that in the Western world, men and women were accustomed to intermingle without restriction, so he considered that he would also have to let them join and live within the temple, although this might cause some problems later. Thus we have the famous <em>brahmacāriṇi-āśrama</em>, which so disturbed some persons in India. Prabhupāda explained in his books that one cannot change the social customs of a country overnight, and therefore to keep pace with the so-called culture of the West, he allowed the ladies, who he considered valuable members of the society, to live in ISKCON.

So it is forever established in ISKCON, because of Prabhupāda's third <em>sūtra</em>, that utility, or doing the needful, is our principle of action. We can see this manifested today in our usage of computers, electronic communication, and all types of machines in the service of the Lord. Although <em>sannyāsīs</em> generally had nothing in the way of material possessions and didn't even wear shoes, what to speak of a watch, Prabhupāda engaged his <em>sannyāsīs</em> in preaching with all paraphernalia considered required. Sometimes he would be very happy to hear how they were making traveling buses that would take the Deities on tour and allow the people to see Them in their own lands. Prabhupāda was very happy to see high technology used to produce his books to the acceptable standards of the modern times. He encouraged us in every way to utilize the facilities of the material world to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He even once stated that were we to have nationwide TV programs regularly appearing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness would become popular within a very short time. Although coming from the conservative social structure of India, Prabhupāda was always ready to do whatever was required to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore this movement has become what it is today.

subsub=Purity Is the Force

If one wishes to have spiritual potency, he has to be pure. Although this statement is axiomatic, sometimes it is forgotten by devotees temporarily bewildered by the influence of lust, anger, and greed. It is very difficult to become Kṛṣṇa conscious if one is not following the regulative principles. We must always be on guard to make sure that we do not eat meat, fish, eggs, or anything not offered properly to Kṛṣṇa; that we avoid all forms of illicit sex, real or artificial; that we do not take intoxication of any kind; and that we do not gamble. One who strictly follows these rules is strong in devotional life, but those who break these rules are always weak and full of doubts.

Purity does not only mean following the regulative principles, for one must become pure in mind as well. If one externally follows the principles, yet within always dwells on the objects of sense gratification, he is called a pretender. Such a person will have a hard time to ultimately maintain the principles; when the opportunity arises, he may fall down. Therefore one has to be pure both in body and mind.

To do this, one should make sure that he follows the programs in the temple, or makes programs in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van. One should follow the schedules of the programs, at least from <em>maṅgala-ārati</em> until <em>prasādam</em> time, for this will help one attain spiritual power and energy. The most important activity of the day is chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mahā-mantra</em>, at least sixteen rounds, with attention and enthusiasm. If one can hear while chanting his rounds, he will have a beneficial, favorable day in devotional life. Kṛṣṇa is pleased with the person who can hear His holy name with attention. Chanting carelessly will not help one advance very quickly in devotional life. One requires the spiritual energy that comes from associating with Kṛṣṇa's holy name, and when one can do this properly, he can accomplish remarkable things for the satisfaction of the Lord.

Purity also means intellectual purity. Kṛṣṇa states at the end of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that anyone who studies this sacred conversation worships Him with his intelligence. Therefore it is the duty of everyone to read Śrīla Prabhupāda's books every day for a fixed duration of time. If one reads the Vedic scriptures for one or two hours a day, his intelligence will develop and he will become free from doubts and anxiety for gain and safety. One can become completely free from all sinful reactions when these reactions are burnt to ashes in the fire of devotional knowledge.

The dictionary defines "force" as either strength and power, or action being taken physically against others:

<strong>force</strong> <em>n.</em> 1. strength; energy; vigor; power; 2. the intensity of power; impetus [the force of a blow]; 3. a) physical power or strength exerted against a person or thing [to use force in opening a door]; b) the use of physical power to overcome or restrain a person; physical coercion; violence [to resort to force in dispersing a mob]; 4. the power of a person to act effectively and vigorously; moral or intellectual strength [force of character].

All these definitions fit one who is pure. Purity is the force from all these different points of view. Purity means strength and power, as well as the ability to exert his will over others and conquer them, for one who is pure can, by his spiritual strength, capture the hearts of those who take shelter of him. By his spiritual strength, he can deliver the conditioned souls from the grips of <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em> is so powerful that she can capture everyone, but the devotee is so powerful that he can break <em>māyā's</em> hold over the conditioned soul and deliver him back to Godhead.

It takes vast armies of men, well equipped with all forms of weapons, to conquer a nation. But we can see from the examples of Lord Caitanya and Śrīla Prabhupāda that from the force of purity, numberless living entities can be delivered from the clutches of <em>māyā</em> and return home, back to Godhead. Lord Caitanya saved all of India by His preaching purity. This purity makes one the most potent preacher. Because of this purity, Śrīla Prabhupāda was able to attract so many young people who ordinarily had no attraction to religious activities.

Although Prabhupāda was externally an old man who had no physical resources or strength, he was the most powerful because he had Kṛṣṇa, and thus he had the spiritual force required to melt our stonelike hearts and minds.

If we want to become successful preachers, we must always remember that it is not only a function of endeavor. Endeavor is good, and endeavor for Kṛṣṇa is purifying, but one must have spiritual purity to get the strength required to save the fallen souls. Those who go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> must always remember that without purity, there is no strength, and without strength, there is no potency. Everyone has the experience of being useless on the street. This is because of impurity. If one can always remain pure, he will always have the potency to distribute books and attract people to Kṛṣṇa.

Books are the basis, but purity is the force. It is not possible to go on distributing books for a longer period of time unless one is pure. Therefore we can see how the older <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have developed such nice, clean hearts through their intense endeavor to distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Even if one is not distributing books but is supporting the book distribution by raising funds to allow the book distributors to be free from the worries of making <em>lakṣmī</em>, or if one is supporting the distributors by carrying their books, cleaning their clothes, or cooking for them, one can become pure solely by serving this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. And then, regardless of one's service, he will have the spiritual strength to go on with his service for his entire life, always advancing toward the goal of love of Godhead as a personal servitor of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual world. Therefore, let us develop purity of heart through this preaching mission, and while delivering the people of this world, let us move forward together on the path of devotional service.

sub=Letter from Śrīla Prabhupāda, July 24, 1977

letter=My dear Harikeśa Mahārāja,

Please accept my most humble obeisances. His Divine Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda has received your ecstatic BBT Trustee Report dated July 13th, 1977, and has instructed me to reply you.

I could not get very far, only the first two paragraphs, before Śrīla Prabhupāda stopped me, saying, “All the blessings of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Mahārāja upon you. You are the most important grandson of Bhaktisiddhānta. Go on doing like this.” When His Divine Grace began to hear the huge quantity of books which you are in the midst of printing, covering thirteen languages, he said, “This is tremendous. Do it very nicely. And scholarly, that will be complete…”

His Divine Grace concluded his ecstatic appreciation of your efforts by saying, "He is surpassing all BBTs. I want to go to Germany immediately but I am physically unfit. I like that place—the Schloss. It is a very nice place. Thank you very much.”

Hoping this meets you in the best of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

title=The Author

Śrīla Harikeśa Swami was born on October 23, 1948. In February 1971 he joined ISKCON, and in July he became an initiated disciple of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. During the years that followed, he became Śrīla Prabhupāda's personal servant and secretary, traveling with him in India and around the world.

The year 1976, however, marked a significant turning-point in Śrīla Harikeśa Swami's devotional career - Śrīla Prabhupāda ordered him to print his books in all the languages of the world and to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the European and Soviet communist countries.

That same year Harikeśa Swami was awarded <em>sannyāsa</em> and immediately left for Europe to carry out the instructions of his spiritual master. In December he was appointed GBC and BBT Trustee for Eastern Europe and Germany; and in March 1977, GBC for Austria, Switzerland and Scandinavia. Shortly thereafter, Śrīla Prabhupāda ordered him, along with ten other senior disciples, to accept the duties of an initiating <em>guru</em>.

One of the most important missions that Śrīla Prabhupāda left to his disciples is the development of Mayapur City. From the early days of the Puṣpa-samādhi Project, Harikeśa Swami has worked to actualize Śrīla Prabhupāda's far-reaching vision of a wonderful temple and city in Mayapur. And his most recent contribution is a state-of-the-art multimedia presentation of ISKCON that will help raise funds for the Mayapur Project.

Over the years, a distinguishing feature of Harikeśa Swami's mood of service to Śrīla Prabhupāda has been the focused understanding that book production and book distribution are the heart and soul of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. Because of his single-minded enthusiasm and dedication in this regard, the North European BBT has steadily increased its productivity and now prints approximately 10 million pieces of transcendental literature in forty languages every year.

Aside from his other engagements, Harikeśa Swami is also writing books. The <em>Varṇāśrama Manifesto for Social Sanity</em> deals with the Vedic concept of social organization. His <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> lectures in Śrīdhāma Mayapur have been published in a book entitled <em>The Thirteenth Chapter</em>, and a series of books elaborating on the other chapters of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā As It </em>Is will be published in the years to come.

On yet another preaching front, Harikeśa Swami has been reaching out to younger generations through his music since the late 1970s. His group RASA came out with nine LPs, and from the mid-1980s, his group BLISS has produced another ten tapes and CDs. From 1990 to 1992 he organized grand tours of the GAURANGA BHAJAN BAND, which was known for its impressive stage acts. At this band's concerts, thousands of people, especially in Eastern Europe, chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mantra</em> and danced in ecstasy. His latest success has been the best-selling techno CD <em>Rising Sign</em> by SRI HARI. Through this direct, appealing and modern medium, millions of people have heard the transcendental message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
