<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 51<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
The combat of Jatāyu and Ravana ensues now, as Ravana was adamantine to the righteous sermons of Jatāyu. 
In combating with Ravana, Jatāyu shatters Ravana&#39;s bows, arrows, and chariot and kills the mules of 
the chariot and plucks off the head of the charioteer with his beak. Further Jatāyu attacks on the 
body of Ravana lacerating severally. Enraged at the bird-hits Ravana severs that eagle&#39;s wings, feet, 
and sides. Then seeing that fallen eagle Seetha weeps over, as if Jatāyu is her own relative.</p>

<p class="Romsloka">
iti uktaḥ krodha tāmrākṣaḥ tapta kāṃcana kuṇḍalaḥ |<br>rākṣasendro abhidudrāva patagendram amarṣaṇaḥ 
|| 3-51-1</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. tapta kāncana kuṇDalaḥ</em> = burnt [burnishing] golden, ear-knobs; <em>krodha tāmra akshaḥ</em> 
= infuriately, reddened, eyed one; <em>rākshasa indraḥ</em> = demon&#39;s, lord - Ravana; <em>iti uktaḥ</em> 
= thus, one spoken to; <em>a marṣaṇaḥ</em> = not, tolerantly; <em>pataga indram</em> = to bird&#39;s lord;
<em>abhi dudrāva</em> = towards, dashed.</p>

<p class="tat">
When Ravana is spoken to by Jatāyu with judicious words, Ravana&#39;s eyes reddened infuriately, and his 
burnished golden ear-knobs flickered injuriously, and that lord of demons dashed towards the lord of 
birds, intolerantly. [3-51-1]</p>

<p class="comment">
Ravana&#39;s ear-knobs jerked flickeringly, as if they are fireballsas, when he gnashed his teeth in anger. Here 
another type of rendering for this verse is available in other versions, which reads: <em>iti uktasya 
yathā nyāyam rāvaṇasya jaṭāyuṣhā | kruddhasya agni nibhāḥ sarvā rejuḥ vimshati dṛiṣhṭayaḥ ||</em>&#39;thus 
when Jatāyu spoke to Ravana in judicious words, all the twenty eyes of infuriated Ravana are torched, 
like torchlit fires...&#39;</p>

<p class="tat">
As with a startling combat between two gigantic and winged mountains, called ṃt. ṃālyavanta-s, that 
combat between the eagle and demon then became a startling one. [3-51-3]</p>

<p class="comment">
One commentator said that one ṃt. ṃālyavanta is in Dandaka forest and the other in Kishkindha, while 
another commentator said that one is in Dandaka forests and the other is nearby ṃt. ṃeru. There appears 
to be no second ṃt. ṃālyavanta and the poet seems to be taking one mountain and mirroring it, and thus 
saying that if two selfsame mountains were to confront, then it will be disastrous. This is to narrate 
the equivalence between their courage and strength.</p>

end of his torso, jumped to earth. [3-51-19]</p>

<p class="comment">
Again the problem of &#39;untouchability of Seetha&#39; occurred. Hence that compound <em>ankena 
ādāya vaidehīm </em>can be expressed in two ways, one is like the usual villain&#39;s grabbing by torso, and the other is like 
an ardent devotee of Goddess Lakshmi, keeping her on his torso. This is similar to the method adopted 
by Virādha while handling Seetha.</p>

Vividly: The Terminator gives a sinner a longest rope possible to hang himself from a tallest tree. 
Perchance there may be fish that bites the bait, stripping fishhook from fish line, dives deep down 
to escape from the fisherman, and yet it cannot survive even there, because the fishhook is already 
in its throat, which the fish can neither vomit nor swallow. Thus, it is destined to die. Likewise, 
you bit the baited hook called Seetha and running away with that bait and hook around your neck, thereby 
the Terminator has already lassoed His noose around your neck, and perchance you may presently abscond 
from this hermitage, but not from that noose, called Rama&#39;s arrow, for a long time.</p>

<p class="tat">
Ravana, the monarch of Lanka, gazed at that worthily valorous Jatāyu, who in his shine is like a blue-black 
cloud with a whitely white chest and who by now is like a quiescent fire-storm flattened onto ground. 
[3-51-45]</p>

<p class="comment">
The cloudy blackness is simile to the black feathers of the eagle, and to the charred material by a 
wildfire. The whitely white colour is to the whitish feathers on the chest of the eagle, and to the 
white ashes overlaid on the charred material by wildfire, before they ashen. Thus, Jatāyu fell down 
in a supine posture.</p>

But then Seetha, the daughter of Janaka, whose face vies with moonshine hugged eagle Jatāyu, whom Ravana 
has subjugated with his forcefulness and felled down onto the surface of earth, and she wept over incessantly. 
[3-51-46]</p>

<p class="comment">
Seetha is hugging Jatāyu. &#39;Is it admissible or not...&#39; is another debatable issue. &#39;Because it is bird, 
it may be handled...&#39; is one adjustment, while the other is, &#39;when Jatāyu is a personified entity and 
a friend of Dasharatha, this bird is as good as a man. So, Seetha&#39;s touching him shall be a taboo...&#39; 
The commentators deal this aspect in the next chapter of this canto.</p>

Jatāyu - the duteous creature</p>

<p class="comment">The character of Jatāyu is not introduced just to give information 
to Rama at the time of his physical death. He is an example of self-duteous, self-dedicated, unpaid 
servant to his master. In ch.14 of this Aranya canto when Jatāyu firstly met Rama he says:
<em>so aham 
vāsa sahāyaḥ te bhaviṣhyāmi yadi icchasi | idam durgam hi kāntāram mṛiga rākṣhasa sevitam sītām 
ca tāta rakṣhiṣhye tvayi yāte salakṣhmaṇe ||</em>&quot;That is what I am, I will be your helpmate 
at your residence, should you wish so, for this forest is one that is impassable and adorned by predators 
and demons...oh boy, I wish to protect Seetha, if you go out of your residence with Lakshmana...&quot; 3-14-34 
And Jatāyu kept up his pledge in &#39;helping Rama and protecting Seetha&#39; as much as he can, without hesitation. 
This selfless service and sermons he rendered to Ravana are exemplary. This is called
<em>dāsya bhakti</em> &#39;devoutness through selfless service...&#39; and service whether 
paid or unpaid is thus to be rendered selflessly - is the lesson he taught.</p>

<p class="comment">
Secondly, birds hitting airplanes is not a recent phenomenon and 
it existed even before airplanes were invented, as is evident from Jatāyu&#39;s hitting Ravana&#39;s aircraft. 
And Ravana&#39;s aircraft that is variously and amazingly portrayed by the sage-poet, is nothing before 
a bird. Hence, Ravana should have used some other latest state of art technology to prevent such bird-hits. 
This is to say, any artificial paraphernalia is nothing before a living organism, and Hanuma, a mere 
monkey, taking lessons from Jatāyu, a mere eagle, reduces even the artificially devised Lanka to ashes.</p>
