        <div id="bb33835" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>These three verses explain how the material body of the living entity is under the control of the three qualities of the external energy. The body itself is the chariot, and the living entity is the owner of the body, as explained in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (2.13): <i>dehino ’smin yathā dehe. - <span style="color:#990012">เทหิโน′สฺมินฺ ยตฺหา เทเห.</span></i> The owner of the body is called the <i>dehī, - <span style="color:#990012">เทหี,</span></i> and he is situated within this body, specifically within the heart. The living entity is driven by one chariot driver. The chariot itself is made of three <i>guṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">คุณสฺ,</span></i> three qualities of material nature, as confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> (18.61): <i>yantrārūḍhāni māyayā. - <span style="color:#990012">ยนฺตฺรารูฒานิ มายยา.</span></i> The word <i>yantra - <span style="color:#990012">ยนฺตฺร</span></i> means “carriage.” The body is given by material nature, and the driver of that body is Paramātmā, the Supersoul. The living entity is seated within the chariot. This is the actual position.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33836" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The living entity is always being influenced by the three qualities — <i>sattva - <span style="color:#990012">สตฺตฺว</span></i> (goodness), <i>rajas - <span style="color:#990012">รชสฺ</span></i> (passion) and <i>tamas - <span style="color:#990012">ตมสฺ</span></i> (ignorance). This is also confirmed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (7.13). <i>Tribhir guṇa-mayair bhāvaiḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ตฺริภิรฺ คุณ-มไยรฺ ภาไวฮ:</span></i> the living entity is bewildered by the three qualities of material nature. These three qualities are described in this verse as three flags. By a flag, one can come to know who the owner of the chariot is; similarly, by the influence of the three qualities of material nature, one can easily know the direction in which the chariot is moving. In other words, one who has eyes to see can understand how the body is being driven, influenced by the particular type of quality of material nature. In these three verses the activity of the living entity is described to prove how the body becomes influenced by the quality of ignorance, even when a person wants to be religious. Nārada Muni wanted to prove to King Prācīnabarhiṣat that the King was being influenced by the <i>tamo-guṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">ตโม-คุณ,</span></i> the quality of ignorance, even though the King was supposed to be very religious.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33837" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>According to <i>karma-kāṇḍīya, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม-กาณฺฑีย,</span></i> the process of fruitive activities, a person performs various sacrifices directed by the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> and in all those sacrifices animal killing, or experimenting on the life of animals to test the power of Vedic <i>mantras, - <span style="color:#990012">มนฺตฺรสฺ,</span></i> is enjoined. Animal-killing is certainly conducted under the influence of the mode of ignorance. Even though one may be religiously inclined, animal sacrifice is recommended in the <i>śāstras, - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ,</span></i> not only in the <i>Vedas</i> but even in the modern scriptures of other sects. These animal sacrifices are recommended in the name of religion, but actually animal sacrifice is meant for persons in the mode of ignorance. When such people kill animals, they can at least do so in the name of religion. However, when the religious system is transcendental, like the Vaiṣṇava religion, there is no place for animal sacrifice. Such a transcendental religious system is recommended by Kṛṣṇa in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (18.66):</p></div>
    
        <div id="bb33838" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>sarva-dharmān parityajya<br />mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja<br />ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo<br />mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ</i></em></div>

</div>    

        <div id="bb33839" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>“Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.” Because King Prācīnabarhiṣat was engaged in performing various sacrifices in which animals were killed, Nārada Muni pointed out that such sacrifices are influenced by the mode of ignorance. From the very beginning of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.1.2) it is said, <i>dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo ’tra: - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺมฮ โปฺรชฺฌิต-ไกตโว′ตฺร:</span></i> all kinds of religious systems that are involved in cheating are completely kicked out of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> In the <i>bhagavad-dharma, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-ธรฺม,</span></i> the religion dealing with one’s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, animal sacrifice is not recommended. In the performance of <i>saṅkīrtana-yajña - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน-ยชฺญ</span></i> — Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare — there is no recommendation for animal sacrifices.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33840" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In these three verses, King Purañjana’s going to the forest to kill animals is symbolic of the living entity’s being driven by the mode of ignorance and thus engaging in different activities for sense gratification. The material body itself indicates that the living entity is already influenced by the three modes of material nature and that he is driven to enjoy material resources. When the body is influenced by the mode of ignorance, its infection becomes very acute. When it is influenced by the mode of passion, the infection is at the symptomatic stage. However, when the body is influenced by the mode of goodness, the materialistic infection becomes purified. The ritualistic ceremonies recommended in religious systems are certainly on the platform of goodness, but because within this material world even the mode of goodness is sometimes polluted by the other qualities, namely passion and ignorance, a man in goodness is sometimes driven by the influence of ignorance.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33841" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is herein described that King Purañjana once went to the forest to kill animals. This means that he, the living entity, came under the influence of the mode of ignorance. The forest in which King Purañjana engaged in hunting was named Pañca-prastha. The word <i>pañca - <span style="color:#990012">ปญฺจ</span></i> means “five,” and this indicates the objects of the five senses. The body has five working senses, namely the hands, the legs, the tongue, the rectum and the genitals. By taking full advantage of these working senses, the body enjoys material life. The chariot is driven by five horses, which represent the five sense organs, namely the eyes, ears, nose, skin and tongue. These sense organs are very easily attracted by the sense objects. Consequently, the horses are described as moving swiftly. On the chariot King Purañjana kept two explosive weapons, which may be compared to <i>ahaṅkāra, - <span style="color:#990012">อหงฺการ,</span></i> or false ego. This false ego is typified by two attitudes: “I am this body” (<i>ahantā - <span style="color:#990012">อหนฺตา</span></i>) and “Everything in my bodily relationships belongs to me” (<i>mamatā - <span style="color:#990012">มมตา</span></i>).</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33842" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The two wheels of the chariot may be compared to the two moving facilities, namely sinful life and religious life. The chariot is decorated with three flags, which represent the three modes of material nature. The five kinds of obstacles, or uneven roads, represent the five kinds of air passing within the body. These are <i>prāṇa, apāna, udāna, samāna - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺราณ, อปาน, อุทาน, สมาน</span></i> and <i>vyāna. - <span style="color:#990012">วฺยาน.</span></i> The body itself is covered by seven coverings, namely skin, muscle, fat, blood, marrow, bone and semen. The living entity is covered by three subtle material elements and five gross material elements. These are actually obstacles placed before the living entity on the path of liberation from material bondage.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33843" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>raśmi, - <span style="color:#990012">รศฺมิ,</span></i> “rope,” in this verse indicates the mind. The word <i>nīḍa - <span style="color:#990012">นีฑ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">นีฑ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">นีฑ</span></i> is also significant, for <i>nīḍa</i> indicates the nest where a bird takes rest. In this case <i>nīḍa</i> is the heart, where the living entity is situated. The living entity sits in one place only. The causes of his bondage are two, namely lamentation and illusion. In material existence the living entity simply hankers to get something he can never get. Therefore he is in illusion. As a result of being in this illusory situation, the living entity is always lamenting. Thus lamentation and illusion are described herein as <i>dvi-kūbara, - <span style="color:#990012">ทฺวิ-กูพร,</span></i> the two posts of bondage.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33844" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The living entity carries out various desires through five different processes, which indicate the working of the five working senses. The golden ornaments and dress indicate that the living entity is influenced by the quality of <i>rajo-guṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">รโช-คุณ,</span></i> passion. One who has a good deal of money or riches is especially driven by the mode of passion. Being influenced by the mode of passion, one desires so many things for enjoyment in this material world. The eleven commanders represent the ten senses and the mind. The mind is always making plans with the ten commanders to enjoy the material world. The forest named Pañca-prastha, where the King went to hunt, is the forest of the five sense objects: form, taste, sound, smell and touch. Thus in these three verses Nārada Muni describes the position of the material body and the encagement of the living entity within it.</p></div>

        <div id="bb33849" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>One form of hunting is known as woman-hunting. A conditioned soul is never satisfied with one wife. Those whose senses are very much uncontrolled especially try to hunt for many women. King Purañjana’s abandoning the company of his religiously married wife is representative of the conditioned soul’s attempt to hunt for many women for sense gratification. Wherever a king goes, he is supposed to be accompanied by his queen, but when the king, or conditioned soul, becomes greatly overpowered by the desire for sense gratification, he does not care for religious principles. Instead, with great pride, he accepts the bow and arrow of attachment and hatred. Our consciousness is always working in two ways — the right way and the wrong way. When one becomes too proud of his position, influenced by the mode of passion, he gives up the right path and accepts the wrong one. <i>Kṣatriya - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span></i> kings are sometimes advised to go to the forest to hunt ferocious animals just to learn how to kill, but such forays are never meant for sense gratification. Killing animals to eat their flesh is forbidden for human beings.</p></div>

This is technically called <i>sūnā, - <span style="color:#990012">สูนา,</span></i> or <i>hiṁsā, - <span style="color:#990012">หิํสา,</span></i> which means the killing of living beings.

Men do not understand that because they unrestrictedly kill so many animals, they also must be slaughtered like animals in big wars. This is very much evident in the Western countries. In the West, slaughterhouses are maintained without restriction, and therefore every fifth or tenth year there is a big war in which countless people are slaughtered even more cruelly than the animals. Sometimes during war, soldiers keep their enemies in concentration camps and kill them in very cruel ways. These are reactions brought about by unrestricted animal-killing in the slaughterhouse and by hunters in the forest. Proud, demoniac persons do not know the laws of nature, or the laws of God. Consequently, they unrestrictedly kill poor animals, not caring for them at all. In the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, animal-killing is completely prohibited. One is not accepted as a bona fide student in this movement unless he promises to follow the four regulative principles: no animal-killing, no intoxication, no illicit sex and no gambling. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the only means by which the sinful activities of men in this Kali-yuga can be counteracted.</p></div>

        <div id="bb33860" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The question may be raised why a living being should be restricted in sense gratification. If a king, to learn how to kill, may go to the forest and kill animals, why should a living entity, who has been given senses, not be allowed unrestricted sense gratification? At the present moment this argument is put forward even by so-called <i>svāmīs - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวามีสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวามีสฺ</span></i> and <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> who publicly say that because we have senses we must satisfy them by sense gratification. These foolish <i>svāmīs</i> and <i>yogīs, - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ,</span></i> however, do not know the injunctions of the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> Indeed, sometimes these rascals come out to defy the <i>śāstras.</i> They even publicly announce that there should be no more <i>śāstras, - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ,</span></i> no more books. “Just come to me,” they say, “and I shall touch you, and you will become immediately spiritually advanced.”</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33861" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Because demoniac people want to be cheated, so many cheaters are present to cheat them. At the present moment in this Age of Kali-yuga, the entire human society has become an assembly of cheaters and cheated. For this reason the Vedic scriptures have given us the proper directions for sense gratification. Everyone is inclined in this age to eat meat and fish, drink liquor and indulge in sex life, but according to the Vedic injunctions sex is allowed only in marriage, meat-eating is allowed only when the animal is killed and offered before the goddess Kālī, and intoxication is allowed only in a restricted way. In this verse the word <i>niyamyate - <span style="color:#990012">นิยมฺยเต</span></i> indicates that all these things — namely animal-killing, intoxication and sex — should be regulated.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33862" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Regulations are meant for human beings, not for animals. The traffic regulations on the street, telling people to keep to the right or the left, are meant for human beings, not for animals. If an animal violates such a law, he is never punished, but a human being is punished. The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> are not meant for the animals, but for the understanding of human society. A person who indiscriminately violates the rules and regulations given by the <i>Vedas</i> is liable to be punished. One should therefore not enjoy his senses according to his lusty desires, but should restrict himself according to the regulative principles given in the <i>Vedas. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i> If a king is allowed to hunt in a forest, it is not for his sense gratification. We cannot simply experiment in the art of killing. If a king, being afraid to meet rogues and thieves, kills poor animals and eats their flesh comfortably at home, he must lose his position. Because in this age kings have such demoniac propensities, monarchy is abolished by the laws of nature in every country.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33863" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>People have become so degraded in this age that on the one hand they restrict polygamy and on the other hand they hunt for women in so many ways. Many business concerns publicly advertise that topless girls are available in this club or in that shop. Thus women have become instruments of sense enjoyment in modern society. The <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> enjoin, however, that if a man has the propensity to enjoy more than one wife — as is sometimes the propensity for men in the higher social order, such as the <i>brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ, กฺษตฺริยสฺ</span></i> and <i>vaiśyas, - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺยสฺ,</span></i> and even sometimes the <i>śūdras - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ</span></i> — he is allowed to marry more than one wife. Marriage means taking complete charge of a woman and living peacefully without debauchery. At the present moment, however, debauchery is unrestricted. Nonetheless, society makes a law that one should not marry more than one wife. This is typical of a demoniac society.</p></div>

All living entities have come into this material world to enjoy themselves. Consequently, the <i>Vedas</i> are given to regulate sense enjoyment. One who enjoys his senses under the Vedic regulative principles does not become entangled in the actions and reactions of his activities. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (3.9), <i>yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญารฺตฺหาตฺ กรฺมณฮ:</span></i> one should act only for the performance of <i>yajña, - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญ,</span></i> or to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu. <i>Anyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">อนฺยตฺร โลโก′ยํ กรฺม-พนฺธนฮ:</span></i> otherwise any action will produce a reaction by which the living entity will be bound.

He is therefore directed by the Vedic regulative principles to work in such a way that he may fulfill his desires for sense gratification and at the same time gradually become freed from material bondage. Action according to such principles is called knowledge. Indeed, the word <i>veda - <span style="color:#990012">เวท</span></i> means “knowledge.” The words <i>jñānena na sa lipyate - <span style="color:#990012">ชฺญาเนน น ส ลิปฺยเต</span></i> indicate that by following the Vedic principles, one does not become involved in the actions and reactions of his fruitive activities.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33869" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Everyone is therefore advised to act in terms of the Vedic injunctions and not irresponsibly. When a person within a state acts according to the laws and licenses of the government, he does not become involved in criminal activities. Man-made laws, however, are always defective because they are made by men who are prone to committing mistakes, being illusioned, cheating and having imperfect senses. The Vedic instructions are different because they do not have these four defects. Vedic instructions are not subject to mistakes. The knowledge of the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> is knowledge received directly from God, and there is consequently no question of illusion, cheating, mistakes or imperfect senses. All Vedic knowledge is perfect because it is received directly from God by the <i>paramparā - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ปรมฺปรา,</span></i> disciplic succession. In <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.1.1) it is said, <i>tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye: - <span style="color:#990012">เตเน พฺรหฺม หฺฤทา ย อาทิ-กวเย:</span></i> the original creature of this universe, known as the <i>ādi-kavi, - <span style="color:#990012">อาทิ-กวิ,</span></i> or Lord Brahmā, was instructed by Kṛṣṇa through the heart. After receiving these Vedic instructions from Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, Brahmā distributed the knowledge by the <i>paramparā</i> system to Nārada, and Nārada in turn distributed the knowledge to Vyāsa. In this way Vedic knowledge is perfect. If we act according to Vedic knowledge, there is no question of being involved in sinful activities.</p></div>

One who acts on the mental platform has to change his standard of knowledge periodically.

All of this is due to their working on the mental platform without a standard of knowledge. In the Vedic instructions, however, the standard of knowledge is accepted, even though it may sometimes appear that the statements are contradictory. Because the <i>Vedas - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ</span></i> are the standard of knowledge, even though they may appear contradictory, they should be accepted.

Then you will be freed from all miseries.” As soon as one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa and accepts the perfect standard of knowledge, which is <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> as it is, he then comes out of the material modes of nature and does not fall down and lose his knowledge.</p></div>

Rascal <i>svāmīs - <span style="color:#990012">สฺวามีสฺ</span></i> and <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> encourage foolish persons to go on eating flesh and killing animals and at the same time continue their so-called meditation and mystical practices. All these affairs are ghastly, and a compassionate person, namely a devotee of the Lord, becomes very unhappy to see such a sight. The hunting process is also carried on in a different way, as we have already explained. Hunting women, drinking different types of liquor, becoming intoxicated, killing animals and enjoying sex all serve as the basis of modern civilization. Vaiṣṇavas are unhappy to see such a situation in the world, and therefore they are very busy spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33897" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The devotees are pained to see the hunting and killing of animals in the forest, the wholesale slaughter of animals in the slaughterhouses, and the exploitation of young girls in brothels that function under different names as clubs and societies. Being very much compassionate upon the killing of animals in sacrifice, the great sage Nārada began his instructions to King Prācīnabarhiṣat. In these instructions, Nārada Muni explained that devotees like him are very much afflicted by all the killing that goes on in human society. Not only are saintly persons afflicted by this killing, but even God Himself is afflicted and therefore comes down in the incarnation of Lord Buddha. Jayadeva Gosvāmī therefore sings, <i>sadaya-hṛdaya-darśita-paśu-ghātam: - <span style="color:#990012">สทย-หฺฤทย-ทรฺศิต-ปศุ-ฆาตมฺ:</span></i> simply to stop the killing of animals, Lord Buddha compassionately appeared. Some rascals put forward the theory that an animal has no soul or is something like dead stone. In this way they rationalize that there is no sin in animal-killing. Actually animals are not dead stone, but the killers of animals are stonehearted. Consequently no reason or philosophy appeals to them. They continue keeping slaughterhouses and killing animals in the forest. The conclusion is that one who does not care for the instructions of saintly persons like Nārada and his disciplic succession surely falls into the category of <i>naṣṭa-prajña - <span style="color:#990012">นษฺฏ-ปฺรชฺญ</span></i> and thus goes to hell.</p></div>

In the <i>Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-รสามฺฤต-สินฺธุ,</span></i> Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī explains that a man becomes sinful out of ignorance only. The resultant effect of sinful life is suffering. Those who are not in knowledge, who commit violations of the standard laws, are subject to be punished under criminal laws. Similarly, the laws of nature are very stringent. If a child touches fire without knowing the effect, he must be burned, even though he is only a child. If a child violates the law of nature, there is no compassion. Only through ignorance does a person violate the laws of nature, and when he comes to knowledge he does not commit any more sinful acts.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33903" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The King became tired after killing so many animals. When a man comes in contact with a saintly person, he becomes aware of the stringent laws of nature and thus becomes a religious person. Irreligious persons are like animals, but in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement such persons can come to a sense of understanding things as they are and abandon the four principles of prohibited activities, namely illicit sex life, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. This is the beginning of religious life. Those who are so-called religious and indulge in these four principles of prohibited activities are pseudoreligionists. Religious life and sinful activity cannot parallel one another. If one is serious in accepting a religious life, or the path of salvation, he must adhere to the four basic rules and regulations. However sinful a man may be, if he receives knowledge from the proper spiritual master and repents his past activities in his sinful life and stops them, he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead. This is made possible just by following the rules and regulations given by the <i>śāstra - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺร</span></i> and following the bona fide spiritual master.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33904" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At present the whole world is on the verge of retiring from a blind materialistic civilization, which may be likened to hunting animals in the forest. People should take advantage of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and leave their troublesome life of killing. It is said that the killers of animals should neither live nor die. If they live only to kill animals and enjoy women, life is not very prosperous. And as soon as a killer dies, he enters the cycle of birth and death in the lower species of life. That also is not desirable. The conclusion is that killers should retire from the killing business and take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to make life perfect. A confused, frustrated man cannot get relief by committing suicide because suicide will simply lead him to take birth in the lower species of life or to remain a ghost, unable to attain a gross material body. Therefore the perfect course is to retire altogether from sinful activities and take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In this way one can become completely perfect and go back home, back to Godhead.</p></div>

Where is money?” Then, at the end of the week, he wants to retire from these activities and go to some secluded place to rest. King Purañjana returned to his home because he was very much fatigued from hunting animals in the forest. In this way his conscience came to stop him from committing further sinful activities and make him return home. In <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> materialistic persons are described as <i>duṣkṛtinaḥ, - <span style="color:#990012">ทุษฺกฺฤตินฮ,</span></i> which indicates those who are always engaged in sinful activities. When a person comes to his senses and understands how he is engaging in sinful activities, he returns to his conscience, which is herein figuratively described as the palace. Generally a materialistic person is infected by the material modes of passion and ignorance. The results of passion and ignorance are lust and greed. In the life of a materialist, activity means working in lust and greed. However, when he comes to his senses, he wants to retire. According to Vedic civilization, such retirement is positively recommended, and this portion of life is called <i>vānaprastha. - <span style="color:#990012">วานปฺรสฺตฺห.</span></i> Retirement is absolutely necessary for a materialist who wants to become free from the activities of a sinful life.</p></div>

In this way a man becomes refreshed in mind, exactly like a person who smears scented sandalwood pulp all over his body and decorates himself with ornaments. These decorations may be compared to knowledge of religion and the self. Through such knowledge one becomes detached from a materialistic way of life and engages himself in always hearing <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ, ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> and other Vedic literatures. The word <i>sādhv-alaṅkṛta - <span style="color:#990012">สาธฺวฺ-อลงฺกฺฤต</span></i> used in this verse indicates that one must be absorbed in knowledge gathered from the instructions of saintly persons. Just as King Purañjana began to search out his better half, the Queen, one who is decorated with knowledge and instructions from saintly persons should try to search out his original consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One cannot return to Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless he is favored by the instructions of a saintly person. Therefore Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, <i>sādhu - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ</span>-śāstra - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺร</span>-guru - <span style="color:#990012">คุรุ</span>-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya. - <span style="color:#990012">สาธุ-ศาสฺตฺร-คุรุ-วากฺย, จิเตฺตเต กริยา ไอกฺย.</span></i> If we want to become saintly persons, or if we want to return to our original Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we must associate with <i>sādhu</i> (a saintly person), <i>śāstra</i> (authoritative Vedic literature) and <i>guru</i> (a bona fide spiritual master). This is the process.</p></div>

        <div id="bb33923" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This verse is very significant for those desiring to elevate themselves to a higher level of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When a person is initiated by a spiritual master, he changes his habits and does not eat undesirable eatables or engage in the eating of meat, the drinking of liquor, illicit sex or gambling. <i>Sāttvika-āhāra, - <span style="color:#990012">สาตฺตฺวิก-อาหาร,</span></i> foodstuffs in the mode of goodness, are described in the <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> as wheat, rice, vegetables, fruits, milk, sugar, and milk products. Simple food like rice, <i>dāl, capātīs, - <span style="color:#990012">ทาลฺ, จปาตีสฺ,</span></i> vegetables, milk and sugar constitute a balanced diet, but sometimes it is found that an initiated person, in the name of <i>prasāda, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท,</span></i> eats very luxurious foodstuffs. Due to his past sinful life he becomes attracted by Cupid and eats good food voraciously. It is clearly visible that when a neophyte in Kṛṣṇa consciousness eats too much, he falls down. Instead of being elevated to pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he becomes attracted by Cupid. The so-called <i>brahmacārī - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมจารี</span></i> becomes agitated by women, and the <i>vānaprastha - <span style="color:#990012">วานปฺรสฺตฺห</span></i> may again become captivated into having sex with his wife, or he may begin to search out another wife. Due to some sentiment, he may give up his own wife and come into the association of devotees and a spiritual master, but due to his past sinful life he cannot stay. Instead of being elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he falls down, being attracted by Cupid, and takes to another wife for sex enjoyment. The fall of the neophyte devotee from the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness down to material life is described in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (1.5.17) by Nārada Muni:</p></div>

However, a person who remains steadfast in his family duty or so-called social or family obligation but does not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness receives no profit. One who comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be very cautious and refrain from prohibited activities, as defined by Rūpa Gosvāmī in his <i>Upadeśāmṛta: - <span style="color:#990012">อุปเทศามฺฤต:</span></i></p></div>

        <div id="bb33932" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse the word <i>vediṣat - <span style="color:#990012">เวทิษตฺ</span></i> indicates King Prācīnabarhi. When a man becomes refreshed by association with devotees and awakes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he consults the activities of his mind — namely thinking, feeling and willing — and decides whether he should return to his material activities or stay steady in spiritual consciousness. The word <i>kuśalam - <span style="color:#990012">กุศลมฺ</span></i> refers to that which is auspicious. One can make his home perfectly auspicious when he engages in devotional service to Lord Viṣṇu. When one is engaged in activities other than <i>viṣṇu-bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">วิษฺณุ-ภกฺติ,</span></i> or in other words when one is engaged in material activities, he is always filled with anxieties. A sane man should consult his mind — its thinking, feeling and willing processes — and decide how these processes should be utilized. If one always thinks of Kṛṣṇa, feels how to serve Him and wills to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa, it should be known that he has taken good instruction from his intelligence, which is called the mother. Although the King was refreshed, he nonetheless inquired about his wife. Thus he was consulting, thinking and willing how he could return to his steady good consciousness. The mind may suggest that by <i>viṣaya-bhoga, - <span style="color:#990012">วิษย-โภค,</span></i> or sense enjoyment, one can become happy, but when one becomes advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he does not derive happiness from material activities. This is explained in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (2.59):</p></div>

In such a case, everything about household affairs and all the paraphernalia in the house becomes very pleasing. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu had both a good mother and pleasing wife, and He was very happy at home. Nonetheless, for the benefit of the whole human race, He took <i>sannyāsa - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span> - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาส</span></i> and left both His mother and wife. In other words, it is essential that one have both a good mother and wife in order to become perfectly happy at home. Otherwise home life has no meaning. Unless one is religiously guided by intelligence and renders devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his home can never become very pleasing to a saintly person.

        <div id="bb33947" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There is no difference between a good wife and good intelligence. One who possesses good intelligence can deliberate properly and save himself from many dangerous conditions. In material existence there is danger at every step. In <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (10.14.58) it is said, <i>padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām: - <span style="color:#990012">ปทํ ปทํ ยทฺ วิปทาํ น เตษามฺ:</span></i> this material world is not actually a place of residence for an intelligent person or a devotee because here there is danger at every step. Vaikuṇṭha is the real home for the devotee, for there is no anxiety and no danger. Good intelligence means becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. In the <i>Caitanya-caritāmṛta - <span style="color:#990012">ไจตนฺย-จริตามฺฤต</span></i> it is said, <i>kṛṣṇa ye bhaje se baḍa catura: - <span style="color:#990012">กฺฤษฺณ เย ภเช เส พฑ จตุร:</span></i> unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he cannot be called an intelligent person.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33948" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Herein we see that King Purañjana was searching after his good wife, who always helped him out of the dangerous situations that always occur in material existence. As already explained, a real wife is <i>dharma-patnī - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม-ปตฺนี</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม-ปตฺนี</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม-ปตฺนี.</span></i> That is, a woman accepted in marriage by ritualistic ceremony is called <i>dharma-patnī, - <span style="color:#990012">ธรฺม-ปตฺนี,</span></i> which signifies that she is accepted in terms of religious principles. Children born of a <i>dharma-patnī</i> inherit the property of the father, but children born of a woman who is not properly married do not inherit the father’s property. The word <i>dharma-patnī</i> also refers to a chaste wife. A chaste wife is one who never had any connection with men before her marriage. Once a woman is given the freedom to mingle with all kinds of men in her youth, it is very difficult for her to keep chaste. When butter is brought into the proximity of fire, it melts. The woman is like fire, and man is like the butter. But if one gets a chaste wife, accepted through a religious marriage ritual, she can be of great help when one is threatened by the many dangerous situations of life. Actually such a wife can become the source of all good intelligence. With such a good wife, the family’s engagement in the devotional service of the Lord actually makes a home a <i>gṛhastha-āśrama, - <span style="color:#990012">คฺฤหสฺตฺห-อาศฺรม,</span></i> or household dedicated to spiritual cultivation.</p></div>

King Purañjana left home, neglected his own wife and engaged himself in killing animals. This is the position of all materialistic men. They do not care for a married chaste wife. They take the wife only as an instrument for sense enjoyment, not as a means for devotional service. To have unrestricted sex life, the <i>karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> work very hard. They have concluded that the best course is to have sex with any woman and simply pay the price for her, as though she were a mercantile commodity. Thus they engage their energy in working very hard for such material acquisitions. Such materialistic people have lost their good intelligence. They must search out their intelligence within the heart. A person who does not have a chaste wife accepted by religious principles always has a bewildered intelligence.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb33954" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The wife of King Purañjana was lying on the ground because she was neglected by her husband. Actually the woman must always be protected by her husband. We always speak of the goddess of fortune as being placed on the chest of Nārāyaṇa. In other words, the wife must remain embraced by her husband. Thus she becomes beloved and well protected. Just as one saves his money and places it under his own personal protection, one should similarly protect his wife by his own personal supervision. Just as intelligence is always within the heart, so a beloved chaste wife should always have her place on the chest of a good husband. This is the proper relationship between husband and wife. A wife is therefore called <i>ardhāṅganī, - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺธางฺคนี,</span></i> or half of the body. One cannot remain with only one leg, one hand or only one side of the body. He must have two sides. Similarly, according to nature’s way, husband and wife should live together. In the lower species of life, among birds and animals, it is seen that by nature’s arrangement the husband and wife live together. It is similarly ideal in human life for the husband and wife to live together. The home should be a place for devotional service, and the wife should be chaste and accepted by a ritualistic ceremony. In this way one can become happy at home.</p></div>

As stated in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (5.5.5), <i>parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam. - <span style="color:#990012">ปราภวสฺ ตาวทฺ อโพธ-ชาโต ยาวนฺ น ชิชฺญาสต อาตฺม-ตตฺตฺวมฺ.</span></i> When a person loses his Kṛṣṇa consciousness and loses interest in self-realization, he must engage in sinful activities. All one’s activities in a life devoid of Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply lead to defeat and misuse of one’s life. Naturally one who comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness regrets his previous sinful activities in the human form. Only by this process can one be delivered from the clutches of nescience or ignorance in materialistic life.</p></div>

This is the beginning of the surrendering process. Lord Kṛṣṇa wants everyone to surrender unto Him, and this surrendering process begins when one touches the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master. By sincerely rendering service to a bona fide spiritual master, one begins his spiritual life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Touching the lotus feet of a spiritual master means giving up one’s false prestige and unnecessarily puffed-up position in the material world. Those who remain in the darkness of material existence due to their falsely prestigious positions — so-called scientists and philosophers — are actually atheists. They do not know the ultimate cause of everything. Although bewildered, they are not ready to surrender themselves to the lotus feet of a person who knows things in their proper perspective. In other words, one cannot arouse Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply by his own mental speculation. One must surrender to a bona fide spiritual master. Only this process will help one.</p></div>

Animals and children are sometimes punished not out of vengeance but out of love. Similarly, a master sometimes punishes his servant, not out of vengeance but out of love, to correct him and bring him to the right point. Thus King Purañjana took his punishment dealt by his wife, the Queen, as mercy upon him. He considered himself the most obedient servant of the Queen. She was angry at him for his sinful activities, namely hunting in the forest and leaving her at home. King Purañjana accepted the punishment as actual love and affection from his wife. In the same way, when a person is punished by the laws of nature, by the will of God, he should not be disturbed. A real devotee thinks in this way. When a devotee is put into an awkward position, he takes it as the mercy of the Supreme Lord:</p></div>

In the <i>Manu-saṁhitā - <span style="color:#990012">มนุ-สํหิตา</span></i> it is said that the King should be considered merciful when he condemns a murderer to death because a murderer punished in this life becomes freed from his sinful activity and in the next life takes birth cleared of all sins.

Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya has therefore advised that we not become attracted by a lump of flesh and blood. The story is told that at one time a man, very much attracted to a beautiful woman, wooed the woman in such a way that she devised a plan to show him the ingredients of her beauty. The woman made a date to see him, and before seeing him she took a purgative, and that whole day and night she simply passed stool, and she preserved that stool in a pot. The next night, when the man came to see her, she appeared very ugly and emaciated. When the man inquired from her about the woman with whom he had an engagement, she replied, “I am that very woman.” The man refused to believe her, not knowing that she had lost all her beauty due to the violent purgative that caused her to pass stool day and night. When the man began to argue with her, the woman said that she was not looking beautiful because she was separated from the ingredients of her beauty. When the man asked how she could be so separated, the woman said, “Come on, and I will show you.” She then showed him the pot filled with liquid stool and vomit. Thus the man became aware that a beautiful woman is simply a lump of matter composed of blood, stool, urine and similar other disgusting ingredients. This is the actual fact, but in a state of illusion, man becomes attracted by illusory beauty and becomes a victim of <i>māyā. - <span style="color:#990012">มายา.</span></i></p></div>

When one returns to his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he actually becomes steady, and his life becomes successful.</p></div>

In other words, upon breaking the laws of the state, everyone can be punished by the government except the <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> and Vaiṣṇavas. <i>Brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> and Vaiṣṇavas never transgress the laws of the state or the laws of nature because they know perfectly well the resultant reactions caused by such law-breaking. Even though they may sometimes appear to violate the laws, they are not to be punished by the king. This instruction was given to King Prācīnabarhiṣat by Nārada Muni. King Purañjana was a representative of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, and Nārada Muni was reminding King Prācīnabarhiṣat of his forefather, Mahārāja Pṛthu, who never chastised a <i>brāhmaṇa</i> or a Vaiṣṇava.</p></div>

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has described the <i>vaiṣṇava-aparādha, - <span style="color:#990012">ไวษฺณว-อปราธ,</span></i> or offense to a Vaiṣṇava, as “the mad elephant offense.” One should be very careful not to offend a Vaiṣṇava or a <i>brāhmaṇa. - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ.</span></i> Even the great <i>yogī - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี</span></i> Durvāsā was harassed by the Sudarśana <i>cakra - <span style="color:#990012">จกฺร</span></i> when he offended the Vaiṣṇava Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, who was neither a <i>brāhmaṇa</i> nor a <i>sannyāsī - <span style="color:#990012">สนฺนฺยาสี</span></i> but an ordinary householder. Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was a Vaiṣṇava, and consequently Durvāsā Muni was chastised.</p></div>

Therefore I must admit that I have offended you. Nonetheless, thinking of me as your most intimate subordinate, you should still be very much pleased with me. Factually I am very much bereaved, but being pierced by the arrow of Cupid, I am feeling lusty. But where is the beautiful woman who would give up her lusty husband and refuse to unite with him?</strong></p></div>

        <div id="bb34010" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Both man and woman desire one another; that is the basic principle of material existence. Women in general always keep themselves beautiful so that they can be attractive to their lusty husbands. When a lusty husband comes before his wife, the wife takes advantage of his aggressive activities and enjoys life. Generally when a woman is attacked by a man — whether her husband or some other man — she enjoys the attack, being too lusty. In other words, when one’s intelligence is properly utilized, both the intellect and the intelligent person enjoy one another with great satisfaction. As stated in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> (7.9.45):</p></div>
    
        <div id="bb34011" class="r r-lang-en r-verse-text" ><em><i>yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ<br />kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham</i></em></div>

<i><span style="color:#990012">        ยนฺ ไมตฺหุนาทิ-คฺฤหเมธิ-สุขํ หิ ตุจฺฉํ</span></i><br /><i><span style="color:#990012">กณฺฑูยเนน กรโยรฺ อิว ทุฮข-ทุฮขมฺ</span></i><br />
</div>    

        <div id="bb34012" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The actual happiness of the <i>karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> is sex life. They work very hard outside the home, and to satiate themselves after their hard labor, they come home to enjoy sex life. King Purañjana went to the forest to hunt, and after his hard labor he returned home to enjoy sex life. If a man lives outside the home and spends a week in a city or somewhere else, at the end of the week he becomes very anxious to return home and enjoy sex with his wife. This is confirmed in <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ:</span></i> <i>yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham. - <span style="color:#990012">ยนฺ ไมตฺหุนาทิ-คฺฤหเมธิ-สุขํ หิ ตุจฺฉมฺ.</span></i> <i>Karmīs - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺมีสฺ</span></i> work very hard simply to enjoy sex. Modern human society has improved the materialistic way of life simply by inducing unrestricted sex life in many different ways. This is most prominently visible in the Western world.</p></div>
