<p class="txt">Bharata along with Vasishta proceed to see Bharadwaja. Bharadwaja welcomes both of them hospitable. After exchanging pleasantries
Bharadwaja asks Bharata whether he is coming to the forest to do any harm to Rama and Lakshmana. Bharata replies that he is coming to the forest for
the purpose of taking back Rama to Ayodhya. When enquired by Bharata about the whereabouts of Rama, Bharadwaja informs that Rama along with Seetha
and Lakshmana are staying on the chitrakuta mountain. Thereafter, at the request of Bharadwaja, Bharata along with his routine decides to make a
night halt on that day at that hermitage and to proceed to chitrakuta on the following morning.</p>
