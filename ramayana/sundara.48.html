<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 48<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana calls Indrajit and asks him to go for a battle against Hanuma. Indrajit wielding 
a colourful bow quickly in a chariot to face Hanuma in combat. The arrows discharged by Indrajit are 
made ineffective by Hanuma, through his peculiar skill of maneuvering them like a wind-god. Realizing 
that Hanuma cannot be slain, Indrajit merely takes him captive by discharging the unfailing missile 
presided over by Brahma, the creator. Hanuma falls on the ground motionless. The demons tie him with 
ropes and drag him to the presence of Ravana. Hanuma yields to their operation of capture, even though 
capable of aborting it, eager as he was to meet Ravana.</p>
