<p class="comment">All women, without exception, have a weapon called <em>prathama kopam</em> 'a
preambular fury...' it is exactly not 'fury' but a sort of bewilderment and insultment meted out by
their indignation. Seetha spewed out a stomachful of ire. Pausing a while, she now started to
sermonise this demon with <em>hita bodha</em> 'moral teaching...' thinking in 'his' shoes and
foreseeing 'his' annihilation. What and why does he care? And how does she bother for his
well-being? These questions have their answers in mythology.</p>

<p class="comment">Seetha's wording should have been 'for lovemaking with me...' instead of 'endeavour' but as an urbane lady, she used a + grāmya

<p class="comment">Again she may recount her list of 'suicide programs' as related to Lakshmana after this dialogue. She prefers to use whatever
means to end her life, rather than to surrender to immorality. To indicate this 'character's mood' <em>pātra aucityam</em>&nbsp; of Seetha, all her opinions about
'somebody's possessing her' were listed when Lakshmana was hastened after Rama, though at the cost of Lakshmana's steadfastness in his duty.</p>

'sword-leaved-forest...' in the Hell of Yama, namely <em>naraka</em>.. The
sinners are asked to hug a silk-cotton tree like wooden structure with golden leaves and sappharine flowers and irony thorns, where all these items
will be sweltering the sinners besides pinching and piercing with thorns. This punishment is aimed at those who abduct, molest, or rape the other
man's wife.</p>
