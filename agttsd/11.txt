sub=Mad Ecstasy Marathon Message

Now it is time for the marathon, and everyone here is going completely mad in ecstasy. It is available for you as well, since you are born in the dynasty of marathon warriors. Please take the mission of liberating New York City firmly in your heart, and certainly the Lord will bless you. Please pray before Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda to empower you to distribute a lot of books yourself and to inspire others to increase. You must encourage everyone there to make their mission the liberation of New York City. The place is a den of nonsense, and <em>māyā</em> has a firm hold there. She has captured the city that belongs to Śrīla Prabhupāda and has taken it away. It is your responsibility to regain it for Kṛṣṇa and ISKCON. I have faith that you will do nicely. You have the blessings of the whole disciplic succession. Just go out and get the mercy. Just go, get it, and be happy.

The only alternative is the pit of material existence. Stay healthy and strong. Be austere and avoid nonsense useless talk. Just think, breath, talk, walk, and pray <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

sub=Letter of May 13, 1988

letter=Dear devotees of the North European Zone,

letter=Please accept my humble obeisances or blessings. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

I am writing this letter in a humble attempt to increase our desire to distribute the transcendental books of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the Founder-Ācārya of the ISKCON preaching mission. We have heard about this mission before, and we have also already directly experienced the nectar of engaging in it, but owing to the terrible condition of human society, further discussion on the urgent need to distribute books is required. Awareness of Śrīla Prabhupāda's plan to transform this sinful world through the distribution of his books is the most auspicious means to overcome the bewildering prowess of <em>māyā-śakti</em>.

If we examine the present situation of this planet, we find an absence of auspiciousness. Everywhere we look we see dull people concerned only with eating and having sex. Such persons are playthings in the hands of <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em>, the dazzling material energy, has created an arrangement by which the leaders of this world are pushing all people into an intolerable situation. Just consider the dilemma facing the present generation as they look into a future devoid of hope. Although as devotees we are well protected against the material energy, we have sufficient experience to understand the suffering of those who live within this material world, and we understand that the present condition of human society directly affects us, as we are part of the human society.

It is not only an interesting preaching point when we say that the materialists have created an intolerable situation. The air is being spoiled by defoliation of tropical rain forests and excessive exhaust fumes from factories and vehicles, the water is being polluted by unlimited chemicals, and the weather patterns are becoming most unpredictable and unfriendly. These points are documented, scientific facts. The polar ice caps are melting so fast that the sea level is rapidly changing. The instability of the earth's crust is known to all geologists, and it promises to wreck havoc without a doubt.

Furthermore the mental condition of the people is deteriorating day by day. Violent and psychotic crime is increasing. AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases are laying waste to hundreds and thousands and promise to be the greatest killers of men ever. Even the Black Plague is making a comeback in some parts of the U.S.

It is becoming harder and harder than ever to even take another human birth, as the number of abortions increases exponentially. More babies are killed than are born.

The economic condition of the world, though seemingly somewhat stable, was severely rocked last year. The world economy is deteriorating at a rapid pace, and economists predict a severe crash again.

What about war, atomic weapons and the fragile world of political diplomacy that can change within a moment? How about another meltdown at a nuclear reactor? Things are obviously not stable. The only thing that one can count on is that <em>māyā</em> will continue to suppress all beings under her immense power. The mission of <em>māyā</em> is to make her mystical illusion seem like reality. Most people are eager to be cheated by her false promises, and therefore her job is a somewhat simple affair.

However obvious this is to the devotees, such realizations elude the <em>karmīs</em> eager for sense gratification. They do not want to know that their mundane existence of material enjoyment is limited by time. Such persons cannot see their impending death. Although the plain truth is directly before their eyes, they cannot see it because of their self-inflicted blindness.

Some less experienced devotees also do not understand the dangerous condition of the world. Sometimes they take shelter of some mundane economic concept and think that by making their material situation stable, their problems of life will be solved and happiness and peace will automatically follow. But those with higher intelligence understand that there will be neither peace nor freedom from the miserable conditions of material nature until one is firmly situated in the preaching mission of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

Those blessed with transcendental vision, as well as those blessed with full faith in those with transcendental vision, see beyond the hopeless hankering of the material senses. They understand that no amount of material arrangements will save them from impending death. Even if the world were to come to a complete halt within a fixed period of time, they would rather die on the battlefield distributing books than rot at home praying in fear for salvation. The book distributor does not require to pray for his own protection and liberation, since these things exist as by-products of his preaching mission.

<em>Māyā</em> uses all types of subtle tricks to drag the sincere soul into illusion. Her most formidable weapon is the opposite sex. By waving the form of illusory attachment before the eyes of the sincere searcher for the Absolute Truth, she manages to divert his attention to other fields of action that have no value for saving the world. Bound by affection for wife, children, home, and the rest, a man cannot find his way past his own economic necessities, for it is not an easy task to support the ever-expanding domain of family affairs.

Beware of Cupid's sharp arrows, which become more powerful in the springtime. Steady yourself against the attack of lust by becoming determined to engage in Śrīla Prabhupāda's preaching mission.

We have seen that illusions created by lust cause book distribution to diminish. Since the conditioned souls of the late 1980's are more immersed in ignorance than ever before, new candidates for spiritual perfection are hard to find. Pressing down the slightly inquisitive seeker of knowledge through demoniac propaganda supported by sinful governments, <em>māyā</em> prevents the new influx of fresh troops to do battle against her. The older forces have fallen victim to <em>māyā's</em> allurements in the form of household life, and the emphasis turns to ward comfortable living within the <em>varṇāśrama</em> context rather than the austerity and renunciation required to push on the preaching mission.

Of course, it is easy to say that no one wants to join an austere movement. One could try to make a case that people will only join a perfectly comfortable village arrangement. However, we have not seen this happen anywhere in the world. Although occasionally some family will join a farm community, most new devotees still come through the austere preaching centers. Usually the farm communities are composed of older devotees who have found their niche in life there. Although nothing is wrong with that, and it is probably good for them, a severe problem arises when the number of devotees engaged in non-saṅkīrtana activities is far larger than the number engaged in distribution.

I have concluded that all our endeavors at perfecting the living accommodations for our members has not made an increase in the success of our preaching efforts. Indeed, the preaching mission seems to have rapidly diminished proportionate to the increase of material facility. Opulence seems to be contrary to the revealed principles of Lord Caitanya's mission of <em>vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga</em>. After all, one can get a comfortable situation within the material world, therefore there is no need to join ISKCON just to become comfortable. Maybe comfort is a factor for some people, but most come to us because they require a comfortable spiritual atmosphere, a real shelter from the scorching fire of material nature.

According to observable reality, those places that are still inspired to distribute books are still alive and well, but those places that have been diverted into other areas of activity are plagued with problems. One could conclude from such observations that the austerity and renunciation found in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, when combined with the development of the transcendental knowledge found in our books, form a solid basis for long-term development and success in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

When we engage in the book distribution mission, even if only for a short time, we capture the transcendental energy  that flows from the mercy river emanating from the lotus feet of the Lord. Although we may have other engagements, and some of us shall, since every temple requires <em>pūjārīs</em>, cooks, managers, and so on, if the mood of the temple is based on the desire to expand the preaching mission, the temple will grow and prosper.

If the temple is supported by the efforts of the book distributors, then automatically book distribution is seen as the life and soul of the temple's existence. Naturally the temple managers will want as many book distributors as possible. In any case, our temple managers have to become first-class leaders of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. The temple president does not merely delegate this responsibility to some <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader and forget about it. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> leaders may be there, but the temple president in tune with the beautiful harmony vibrating from the Lord's <em>bṛhad-mṛdaṅga</em> will never allow this most important service to be taken away from him. The temple president is the most important <em>saṅkīrtana</em> leader, for through his managerial efforts, the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is supported.

But the purpose of this letter is not only to push the temple president to lead the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement but also to increase the awareness of each devotee within the temple. We are, after all, a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. This means that the movement is based on and supported by <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> means chanting congregationally and distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books. The preaching mission is the mission of this movement. Each devotee must accept that mission in his heart if he desires success in spiritual life.

Unless we accept this mission in our hearts, and unless we make the mission of our spiritual master our mission, we cannot conquer over that most clever enemy of spiritual advancement, <em>māyā-śakti</em>. Many have tried to brave the onslaughts of <em>māyā</em> while meditating on the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, and most have fallen within the first moments of the fight. Even if you are not able to engage one hundred percent on the front lines of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, still you should make it your life and soul to support that mission by all means.

Everyone can support the mission of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement. Feed a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, make him a beadbag, give him nice clothing, or praise him with fitting words, for he is a hero. Show your support by assisting him in his work. Go out yourself and taste the nectar first hand. You do not have to sit in your corner, internally lamenting over your inability to be part of the direct preaching. Get out the door and help the people of this world.

There is no other means to help people than to give them the holy name of the Lord, <em>kṛṣṇa-prasādam</em> and, above all, a book (or a set!). What will an introductory talk do compared with a hard-bound piece of literature? Give them <em>prasādam</em>. Get them to chant. But when you give them a book, it is complete victory for Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda.

Now we are realizing that the book distribution results have diminished over previous years. In fact, they are on the same level as 1986, when everyone went to the festival and stayed there, though their bodies seemingly returned.

Usually at times like this I would beat the <em>mṛdaṅga</em> drum of book distribution loudly in all the temple halls, crying, “Wake up, O warriors. Now is not the time to rest while the forces of <em>māyā</em> are laying waste to the remaining preaching fields.” This year I am a victim of my body. Shot and wounded on the battlefield when I wasn't looking, I remain in the background, trying to encourage the troops with these words. Please take up this mission with all determination. There is no other mission that even comes close to being as important. It is the only way to prevent total chaos in an already chaotic world. Please take this seriously and distribute books.

I hope this meets you all well and eager to distribute the mercy.

sub=Letter of December 12, 1990

letter=My dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes and heroines of East Germany,

letter=Please accept my blessings. You are all doing so nicely there on the marathon. I am very pleased with all of you. Śrīla Prabhupāda is more pleased with all of you; and above all, Lord Caitanya is very pleased with all of you. To please these personalities is the perfection of life.

Please go on pleasing them more and more, and make your lives fully perfect in this very lifetime. When you become completely perfect through this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, then you will hear the lotus flute of the Lord inviting you back to His spiritual abode within a short time. We do not expect that this will come very soon, but even if we have to wait until we are old, still the ecstasy of attaining the lotus feet of the Lord is worth the wait. We can tolerate anything if ultimately we are going to attain the lotus feet of the Lord.

This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is the life and soul of the devotees. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that he had no problems, as long as he could hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. When he chanted, he started to float in the ocean of nectar and could easily step beyond the ocean of material suffering. His only concern was for the fools and rascals in the material world, who are without the understanding of the mercy of the Lord. He is thinking of them in love and wants to help them out of their suffering condition. You are all working in that mood of love for the conditioned souls, so please just go on until every last one of them has been approached with the transcendental mercy in the form of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. This will be the perfection of life.

I hope this meets you well and happy in your divine mission.

sub=Letter of December 15, 1991

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees of the German <em>yātrā</em>,

letter=Please accept my blessings. It is a great honor that I am able to address you all today. You are doing the highest welfare work for the people of your country. This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> movement is the only hope for the people of this world. Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no way that people's lives can become auspicious. Lord Caitanya has guaranteed that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and especially the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, is the highest benediction on the suffering humanity.

Just see how the people of Eastern Germany are so frustrated with material life! They have become mad with material desires, and they are completely frustrated that they cannot enjoy their senses to their full satisfaction. This is a good thing for us in one sense, because it will create an atmosphere in which the young people will come to us out of desperation in search of peace and happiness. Therefore, we should not give up our preaching in East Germany, since the young people are just in the proper stage to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those in distress and those in need of wealth are also candidates for surrendering to Kṛṣṇa if they are pious. Of course, hardly anyone is pious in that place, otherwise what are they doing there? But we can still take advantage of the situation and take the cream of the country and turn them into dedicated <em>saṅkīrtana</em> men and women if we sincerely preach and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness there. And there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's transcendental books.

This mission is eternal. It is going on throughout the history of the universe in some place or other at all times. The <em>ācāryas</em> are constantly preaching this mission and the Lord is always eager that the innocent people get the opportunity to surrender to His lotus feet. Sometimes the preaching mission is more obviously successful than other times, and even sometimes the preaching mission seems to disappear owing to the strong influence of the material nature, but a great <em>ācārya</em>, like Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, appears to reestablish the preaching mission. Therefore, we are very fortunate to be followers of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda and his descendants, like Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Śrīla Prabhupāda dedicated his whole life to writing and publishing his books. Naturally, after the publishing of a book, the next stage is to distribute that book in a large scale throughout the world. We are real followers of Śrīla Prabhupāda when we distribute his books on a large scale.

We are not fruitive. Even if we are not able to distribute as many books as last year because the people in the former DDR are becoming westernized to some extent, still there is nothing to lament about. Our business is to distribute the books as much as we can without considering the results. We may be doing more or less than before, but that does not matter. What matters is that we are doing as much as possible in a sincere manner. Even if we are not so sincere, if we are doing as many books as we can, Kṛṣṇa will be happy, Prabhupāda will be happy, and we will be happy too! Work without fruitive desires, since that is the means of success. You should know that there is no better way to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through this book distribution. We want to please Prabhupāda, and this is the way to do it. Whether you are selling fifty or five hundred books a day, just go out with full enthusiasm, knowing well that your service satisfies the disciplic succession. There is nothing better than this activity. There are so many things in this world that one can do at any given point in time, but of all activities, book distribution and preaching are the best. So let us go on preaching more and more with enthusiasm and become happy in the highest of all transcendental services. Kṛṣṇa will recognize you for your austerity, especially since it is getting a little tougher there, as the people are becoming more crazy than normal. Do not be afraid; Kṛṣṇa will protect you. Although there are severe tests, just consider that because of your <em>karma</em> you should have been killed, but by Kṛṣṇa's grace there were only some small cuts. Just offer your obeisances again and again to Kṛṣṇa, and liberation will become your rightful claim.

Even twenty years ago, no one could imagine that so many books could be distributed in such a short time. This activity goes beyond all material expectations. It is strictly on the spiritual platform, without a tinge of material inebriety. So just continue with this service and become perfect in this life and gradually attain your spiritual bodies as eternal associates of the Supreme Lord in Goloka Vṛndāvana. This is the end goal of all <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

I pay my <em>daṇḍavats</em> to all the sincere <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees of ISKCON.

All glories to you!

sub=Letter of December 12, 1992

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees,

letter=Please accept my blessings or respects, and dear Rohiṇīsuta Prabhu, please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

Materially speaking, this year is one of the worst. Even the Queen of England said, “<em>Annus horribilis</em>.” This year is horrible. Things are breaking down everywhere, and the dream of a better decade after the fall of communism is fast dissipating everywhere. Economies are stagnating and going into recession, social life is becoming more and more complex, and hatred between people is increasing at each step. War is commonplace and has even returned to Europe in what was Yugoslavia, while the rest of the world braces itself for the next major agitation. Presently there are riots throughout India over pseudo-religious issues, which were created by politicians to increase their power and prestige. AIDS is rampant and there is no cure in sight. There is no peace between people. Even devotees are feeling the pinch, as deviant behavior shocks us into remembering that the material world is not our permanent home.

Looking over the world situation, and considering the situation in ISKCON today, I can only understand one point. There is no hope for the world today unless we distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books far and wide. People in the West are too crazy to listen peacefully to a lecture on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Indeed, they will not even come! Some may hear, and that is good, but the masses miss the opportunity because they are too unfortunate. But you great souls—you <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes—you go out every day and give these people hope. You do not care for your own comforts, and despite personal difficulties you are dedicated to bringing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books to every door and in every hand on all the streets of the world.

My obeisances to you from all directions! How wonderful it is to be in the association of such great souls. I wish that I could be there with you today, for this would be the best means of personal purification. But alas, here I remain captured by the flu, eating pills, drinking teas and juices, and pouring drops of esoteric substances down my parched throat. Ah, the fever of the flu is nothing compared to the fever of material existence, which has me firmly in her grips. Someday I shall be fortunate enough to always have the association of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and get freed from the constant headache of problems, which are mounting day by day as the Kali-yuga progresses in all respects.

What benediction can I offer you? Kṛṣṇa Himself did not attempt to offer the <em>gopīs</em> any benedictions, because He knew that they would not accept them. The <em>gopīs</em> serve Kṛṣṇa out of love only, and they never are interested in anything in return for that love. This is selfless love in action. Similarly, you devotees are selflessly going out and distributing love of Godhead without any concern for payment in the form of material benefits or benedictions. Indeed, you are not even interested in liberation! Who can understand your deep realizations? Even Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are aware of the intense austerities of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees and are broadcasting their glories throughout the three worlds.

Never before in history has there been such a movement to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the world in so short a period of time. You are part of history in the making. You are actually present when this great movement is making itself known in Europe, where people are dull, ignorant, foolish, envious, and vicious. If we examine these people, we will see that there are few with any good qualities at all, but now and then you meet someone who you know just requires a little push to become inspired to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Such a meeting inspires you to go on distributing, for seeing the results before your eyes inspires you to keep on releasing these rays of mercy over the darkened skies of Europe. May you always be successful in your attempts to open their darkened eyes and awaken them from their long sleep on the lap of <em>māyā</em>.

“Go on marching, O spirit soul, on the path to the spiritual goal.” Yes. What else is there to do but <em>saṅkīrtana</em>? Nothing, of course, for this movement is based on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is its primary weapon. Sometimes you meet such nice people that you have to take their names and addresses. The preachers will put these names and addresses in a data base and start to contact these people as they can. Through our preaching programs and by inviting people to our many centers, people can gradually become connected to ISKCON and develop their Kṛṣṇa consciousness in action by becoming a donor and supporting a center. They perform <em>karma-yoga</em>, giving up the results of their work for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa.

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> takes place on the front lines, where direct contact with the living entity is made and his first commitment to Kṛṣṇa consciousness is planted as he purchases a book from the enthusiastic representative of God, who stands before him on a desolate street.

As the wind whips through the alleys and catches a piece of paper here and there, the last rays of the sun wash horizontally down the street. The <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee adjusts his cap and tightens his belt, as he prepares to meet the material nature head on in a ferocious battle, just as Kṛṣṇa adjusted His belt before battling Aghāsura in Vṛndāvana. What comparison is there between the streets of Berlin, Stockholm, or Moscow and the transcendental realm of Gokula Vṛndāvana? We cannot find any similarity by looking with material eyes. But if we understand with the heart of a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee, we can feel the spiritual energy surging through us as we float down the street hand in hand with the Lord, who also is driving our chariot within the heart and guiding us to people who are willing to take their share of the stockpile of love of Godhead in the form of these transcendental books. Because of the devotee's connection with the Lord, the streets, although dark and disturbed, become a place of bliss. The devotee is not at all in anxiety, for he has the connection to the source of all power and potency, Kṛṣṇa.

What more can I say? Just be satisfied in yourselves, knowing well that you are engaged in the most important service for the sake of the millions of suffering people in this world. Do not be fooled by any ideas born of self-interest; <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is the means to please the Lord. Our strength is born of our conviction that this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is the topmost. Just perform this mission with enthusiasm, intelligence, conviction, and determination, and clear out the piles of material problems that crowd into our consciousness through the influence of <em>māyā</em>.

Pray to Kṛṣṇa for strength, and He shall certainly respond. Know it for sure that you are in the best hands.

I hope this meets you in the best of health and highest spirits.

sub=Letter of January 6, 1993

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees of the CIS,

letter=Please accept my blessings or respects.

I am very pleased to address you on this day when you are all meeting in Moscow after the most successful marathon ever performed by any country in the history of ISKCON. You have exceeded even the most optimistic expectations. All glories to you all, who are so wonderfully executing the mission of Śrīla Prabhupāda and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They must be so pleased with all of you. We cannot even imagine how pleased they are, but if you continue to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the CIS by distributing so many books like you are presently doing (and what to speak of increasing the distribution even more!), it is certain that you will become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious in this lifetime and attain the personal association of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote to the German devotees in 1977, “Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of these books." This means that although other methods of preaching are effective, and they must go on, the most effective and important means of preaching is through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Śrīla Prabhupāda also wrote to me in 1976 that he considered that the preaching in Poland would be a great success because I was distributing his books to the people there. And we have seen that the preaching was a success and is growing more and more because they are also distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books with enthusiasm.

Please be satisfied by distributing these books. This work is our life's mission. If we can flood the CIS with these transcendental books, we can completely change the mentality of the people from materialism to spiritualism. Prabhupāda said that if even one percent of the world's population takes up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the whole world can change. Therefore, we have to continually preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness by all means and methods to bring these people to the transcendental platform. So let the primary preaching go on unlimitedly in the form of the transcendental distribution of these books. Be happy distributing these books, for there is no other service that can make you as free and satisfied.

Sometimes we think of material things and become absorbed in ideas of sense gratification. But these ideas are merely mental concoctions that cannot help us attain happiness. Happiness, according to the material calculation, does not exist in truth; rather, it is a mental concoction that lasts for a short amount of time before the concomitant miseries of the material nature begin. Such happiness is only a short filling between the layers of misery. Who can be happy in this material world? The people of the CIS thought that they would be happy if they changed their system, but the miseries of the material world have remained. Until they change their hearts and accept Kṛṣṇa into their lives, they will never be able to get out of the various miserable conditions that will continue to haunt them until death.

Let us become perfectly happy by engaging ourselves in the devotional service of the Lord with all our hearts and souls. Let us devote ourselves to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission with all enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is the first quality favorable for the increase of devotional service. Let the enthusiasm you now feel after this successful marathon push you forward into the year 1993, so that the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> can continue with full force into the future. Actually we are on a twenty-year marathon, and we have completed one year of it. There is no cessation of this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission; it will go on increasingly as time goes by.

Utilize your youthful lives to push out these books in greater and greater quantities. We are young now, and we have the energy to make this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission work. As time goes by the body grows older, and this can cause (in the conditioned soul) a decrease in the energy available for distributing books. Therefore, just go on distributing books more and more while you have a young form. It will be to your eternal credit. When you eventually face the Lord, He will remark, “Ah, you are a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee!” The Lord loves to associate with His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

Go on regularly hearing and chanting nicely sixteen rounds of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, following the four regulative principles, and coming to the programs in the temple. And then, with great strength and enthusiasm, distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books more and more. This is the perfection of life.

May Śrīla Prabhupāda bless you. May Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu bless you, as well as Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, the most merciful consort of the Lord. Please go on serving the Lord in this way and become perfect in your preaching mission. Thank you for allowing me to associate with you all. I shall become purified in your association. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

I hope this meets you in good health and a happy serving mood.

sub=Letter of December 12, 1994

letter=Dear <em>saṅkīrtana</em> heroes of the North European Zone,

letter=Please accept my blessings or humble obeisances. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda, who has so mercifully given us the yearly transcendental marathon through his divine inspiration. May Śrīla Prabhupāda's books be distributed far and wide to all the corners of the earth during this ecstatic marathon season.

Once again you are all gathered together in the middle of the Prabhupāda Marathon. The year is 1994, but it could be any year at any time. The service is timeless and therefore does not have the characteristics of time, place, or circumstance. Book distribution does not depend on any material situation. Although it is sometimes helped by some external conditions, such as the collapse of communism in 1990–91, we can see that ultimately the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission is gradually increasing throughout the world. Our only mission is to accept this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service with a full heart, convinced that this is the proper means to save the fallen conditioned souls.

The people of this world are disturbed. I have just seen on COM the results of a poll taken in the U.S.A. More than sixty percent of the people there think that soon there will be a huge catastrophe and massive destruction. Although we are not concerned with such opinions because we know that Kṛṣṇa will protect us under all circumstances, it is interesting that people are somehow aware that they are sinful and that they will have to pay the price for their crimes. Everyone knows that this modern life of material lust and greed cannot continue; it must soon come crashing down. They can see this, but still they cannot change their long-standing habits because their hearts are hardened by all their harsh and cruel activities.

Even the so-called pious persons who profess a particular kind of religion kill and eat animals daily or kill children in the womb. The modern society has neatly tucked the horrible scene of animals being slaughtered and children being murdered “out of sight, out of mind.” Therefore people think that nothing is wrong with these activities. When they worry about sinful reactions, they are not very clear about which reactions will create their pain. They only understand that the pain will come, without considering the bona fide process to alleviate this pain and cure the root cause of material disease.

The time is ripe in the world. People are ready for Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. If they get them and read them, they will find spiritual solutions to the problems of the world. Everyone can see that from spiritual darkness this world is suffocating. We have to present these books to the people, so that they can get a taste of higher knowledge descending from the spiritual platform. This taste is transcendental and has to be cultivated for many lives. However, Śrīla Prabhupāda has written his books so that even a dull-headed person can see the beauty of his words and the pristine relevance of his purports.

Now is the time to act. Now we must distribute these books with greater and greater enthusiasm. Sometimes we think that someone else can distribute these books and we should rather do some economic development to make our old age peaceful and happy. But this is a selfish idea, which also doesn't always work. It is not sure that you will be an economic success, especially when you do not work for the betterment of our Kṛṣṇa conscious society. A Kṛṣṇa conscious society is the key to correcting the problems of this world, the books are the basis of this correction, and the time to distribute them is now.

Do not wait. You are only growing older and older each day. The body breaks down and gets weaker as you get older, and you cannot distribute with the same enthusiasm, although in Russia, a few ladies in their late sixties still distribute like anything. In any case, we should use the energy we have now to perform the most important welfare activity of all, the distribution of the books of the most blessed Founder-Acārya of ISKCON, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda.

What more needs be said? We know within our hearts that this book distribution mission is most relevant and essential. We know that the time is ripe and that we have nothing else to do than to distribute these books. We know that this is the way to get the mercy from Śrīla Prabhupāda and his devoted followers. We know that the people need this mercy more than ever before. And we know that they will take these books if we are Kṛṣṇa conscious and determined in our mission. Actually they want these books, but they just don't know that because of ignorance.

The Supersoul is within the heart of each person you meet. The Supersoul is telling them (unless they are demons), “Take this book. It is good for you. You will like it.” We merely have to appeal to the Lord within their hearts and attract them to His words and it will even be easy to get them to take a full set. It is an art, and we only have to learn this art. We only have to understand a few helpful hints from the <em>mahā-rathī</em> distributors and adapt these hints to our own style of distribution, and then everything will go easily. The books will fly out of our hands into the waiting hands of the people we meet.

Do not fear. There is nothing to fear in this world except ignorance, and every devotee is far beyond the realm of darkness because of being illuminated by the teachings of the Lord in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. Śrīla Prabhupāda has presented Kṛṣṇa's words in such an attractive manner that the mind of every devotee is linked to the Lord. Now we have to go out and meet these people with confidence, knowing that we are well equipped with all the spiritual paraphernalia required to distribute these books. We have the knowledge, we have the strength, we have the mercy, we have the confidence, and we have the conviction that this is the best thing to do. What more do we need? Just go out and make your lives a success, and be happy.

And remember to bless me with the dust of your lotus feet during the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> festival at the end of December. Thank you all very much for allowing me to address you with these few words of encouragement. Although I am very low and fallen, I take strength in these opportunities to address the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees during this most important time. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

I hope this meets you well, happy, and fully absorbed in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

sub=On the Occasion of the Middle of the Saṅkīrtana Marathon, December 1995

letter=“Books are the basis<br />Preaching is the essence<br />Utility is the principle<br />Purity is the force"<br />

letter=—Śrīla Prabhupāda

These words stand as a tribute to Śrīla Prabhupāda's genius. Prabhupāda understood the meaning of words in a very deep manner, and he knew how to convey these meanings in well-considered and well-constructed sentences. I remember when Prabhupāda once told me, “My writing is not like your typing, simply moving your fingers here and there. I have to choose every word carefully, for these books will last for the next 10,000 years.” I had often listened to Prabhupāda dictating his books in the middle of the night when I would wake up from sleep in the room next to his. Usually his words came flowing out, but sometimes he would stop and think about the exact word that would represent his intention best. Prabhupāda was always in the mood of presenting his books for the understanding of the people of this world, and therefore he always endeavored to pick the proper words to convey the deep concepts that make up our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava philosophy. The most amazing thing is that although most of the people who buy these books and appreciate them have little or no understanding of their deep philosophical content, the devotees, who understand the philosophy, are also fully satisfied by reading his books. How could he have written in such a way that both the neophytes (or less) and the adepts could appreciate what he was saying? Certainly this indicates his remarkable genius, such as is hardly found in modern society.

Let us therefore examine the four lines beginning with the words “Books are the basis.” Although these lines are short, they are powerful like the <em>Vedānta-sūtras</em> of Vedavyāsa. Everything one needs to know to participate in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement according to Śrīla Prabhupāda's desire is included in these four lines. I thought it helpful to seek out the dictionary meanings of the essential words in these four principles and examine these meanings in the light of what Śrīla Prabhupāda has taught us.

subsub=Books Are the Basis

Everyone knows what books are. In all the different languages of the world, millions of books are produced every year. Almost one hundred percent of these books are <em>grāmya-kathā</em>, or subject matters dealing with family, society, nation, or mundane love. Śukadeva Gosvāmī has said that a materialist has thousands of subject matters to speak about, all of them dealing with the home and family, directly or indirectly. We have practical experience that the local bookstore rarely has anything to offer to a devotee, outside of some relevant technical manuals.

But Prabhupāda's books are a different creation. They are translations of the most important books in the universe. Vyāsadeva himself has said of <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> that there is no need of any other book, for <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> presents the essence of spiritual philosophy. And we all know the importance of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>, since it was directly spoken by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. All of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books represent the quintessence of spiritual philosophy and can thus offer the greatest benediction to the people of this world.

How could we live without Śrīla Prabhupāda's books? What would there be to read? What would we have to think about? What would we say in class? We would certainly be lost in the whirlpool of mental speculation were we not to have these most beautiful renditions of the greatest literature known to man. Therefore we can do nothing else than glorify these books and the most merciful personality who has taken the edge of the highest category. Second, the distributor is not an ordinary person. He is a person who studies the books regularly and lives according to the principles in them. He is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.

But how are the people to understand this? It is therefore essential that the devotee present the books in a way that the people can understand the immediate difference between these books and the ordinary literature meant for crows. The persons these books are meant for are like swans, who inhabit lakes filled with clear water and lotus flowers, and ordinary books are attractive to crows, who inhabit heaps of filthy garbage. The prime duty of the devotee distributing books is to instill within the prospective purchaser the idea that these books are special. If the person can understand somehow or other that these books are completely different from the material variety, and that the purchase of these books marks a turning point in one's humdrum life of material, so-called pleasures, then he will purchase them without delay.

It is clear that Śrīla Prabhupāda's books are the most important books in the world and that distribution of these books is the most important service one can perform in ISKCON today. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that “Books are the basis.” What did he mean by "basis”?

Here is what the Compton's Dictionary has to say about the word:

<strong>ba·sis</strong> <em>n.</em>, <em>pl.</em> <strong>ba·ses</strong> 1. the base, foundation, or chief supporting factor of anything; 2. the principal constituent of anything; 3. the fundamental principle or theory, as of a system of knowledge.

These three primary definitions of the word "basis” clearly indicate what Prabhupāda meant when he said, “Books are the basis.” Books are the base, the foundation, and chief supporting factor of ISKCON, and distributing these books is the fundamental principle in ISKCON. This is very clear. We do not need to speculate to understand what he meant, for the <em>mukhya-vṛtti</em>, or the direct dictionary definitions of the words used, clearly determine the import of his statement. Simply speaking, books are the very base upon which ISKCON is built.

We often speak about ISKCON as a house. But do we really understand the foundation of this house? Sometimes a foundation is overlooked by people enamored by the way the upper stories of a house appear. Even a flag hanging outside the front entrance draws more attention and discussion than the foundation, which is factually the support of the existence of the house.

If the flag were not there, would it matter so much? But if the foundation were not there, the house could not exist. Of course, a house is a combination of many elements, all of them important in their own way. But every engineer knows that a house is only so solid as the foundation upon which it is built. One may have a beautiful house, complete with all the decorations and fanfare, but if the foundation is rotten, the house is worthless and will soon come tumbling down.

Some devotees do not appreciate the function of book distribution in ISKCON. Granted that many do, there are some who take it lightly and do not care about this essential activity. Then again, there are some devotees who only care about this activity and do not care about other forms of devotional service. Neither attitude is healthy, nor is such a lack of understanding of the complete picture in ISKCON good for the preaching mission. One should appreciate all the devotees' services and understand how they work together to advance the preaching mission. But one should never forget that basis upon which the whole of ISKCON stands, without which we would be lost—the books.

Whenever someone asked Śrīla Prabhupāda where he got the money to do his various projects, he would immediately answer, “We are selling <em>lakhs</em> [hundreds of thousands] of our books every day!” He was very pleased to say that to doubters. He was proud of his books' sales figures and his booksellers. That is not to say he didn't appreciate the other services the devotees performed, not at all, but he would emphasize the book distribution because he knew that it was essential to the development of his movement. Indeed, all the projects constructed in India would not have been possible without the help of the BBT, which gets its money through the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

So it is clear that books are certainly important, and we should never forget this in our devotional lives. All managers of all temples should see to it that book distribution is going on in their areas, at least to some degree, and they should be eager, at least within their hearts, to expand that distribution more and more according to their means. And we should pray regularly to the Deities and Śrīla Prabhupāda to send us more <em>saṅkīrtana</em> warriors, so that we can increase the distribution of these wonderful books more and more.

<em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees understand the importance of their mission. They so much desire to hear about this mission that they speak about it and read about it regularly. Sometimes devotees think that they are missing something by not taking part in all the other aspects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and just distributing books, but we have seen that <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have no trouble learning any art required for preaching and management later on when it is desired. If the basis is there, everything else comes automatically. Therefore one should go on distributing these books with great enthusiasm, for this will support the ISKCON society with everything it needs to expand, grow, and become more and more influential in the world.

subsub=Preaching Is the Essence

The next <em>sūtra</em> of Śrīla Prabhupāda's is “Preaching is the essence.” We all know what it means to preach. As Śrīla Prabhupāda himself said to the German devotees in 1976, “Know it for certain that there is no better way to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness than through the distribution of my books.” This immediately tells us what the best means of preaching is. Therefore the book distributors are always engaged in the topmost preaching mission. Śrīla Prabhupāda also said, “What is the use of your two minutes of preaching? The person will hear and go away. But if he takes a book he is eternally benefited.” Therefore every book distributor should know that when he distributes one of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, he is bringing Prabhupāda directly into the homes of the people. Prabhupāda is directly preaching to these fallen conditioned souls. And who is a better preacher than Prabhupāda? Therefore book distribution is the best way to preach.

But there are other ways to preach as well. Prabhupāda was not small-minded and narrow. He wanted all forms of preaching to go on, for he saw that different devotees have different inclinations to preach, and he encouraged all of them according to their desires. Once, in South Africa, I mentioned to Śrīla Prabhupāda that I liked to do large programs of chanting and distributing <em>prasādam</em>. Prabhupāda immediately replied, "Then do it all over the world!” I was very pleased to hear that instruction. Prabhupāda always wanted to encourage everyone in their particular desire to preach. All kinds of preaching are required, for this is a big world and there are many fallen souls. Let all the preaching programs go on simultaneously, for they will benefit each other and ultimately ISKCON will benefit.

Prabhupāda states in the purport to <em>Madhya-līlā</em>, Chapter Twenty-four, text 205 of the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, “Everyone is eligible to become Kṛṣṇa's devotee. One simply has to be trained according to the approved process. It is the work of Kṛṣṇa's confidential devotees to turn everyone into a <em>kṛṣṇa-bhakta</em>. If the confidential devotees do not take up the task of elevating everyone to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then who will do it? Those who claim to be devotees but do not engage in Kṛṣṇa's service to elevate all living creatures to Kṛṣṇa consciousness are to be considered <em>kaniṣṭha-adhikārīs</em> (people in the lowest stage of devotional service). When one rises to the second platform of devotional service, his business is to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. Those who are active in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should not remain in the neophyte stage but should rise to the platform of preachers, the second platform of devotional service. Devotional service is so enchanting that even the first-class devotees (<em>uttama-adhikārīs</em>) also come down to the second platform to preach and render service to the Lord for the benefit of the whole world.”

Preaching can be done through distributing books or by lecturing in the temples. Preaching can be done in schools, through printed materials, on the radio or TV, or through <em>harināmas</em>. You can preach to a guest who visits the temple or even to people you meet on the street. You just have to follow Lord Caitanya's advice:

quote=yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br />āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa

"Wherever you go, whoever you meet, tell them about Kṛṣṇa. In this way become a <em>guru</em> and deliver your country.” It is not difficult to become a <em>guru</em>. All you have to do is speak exactly what Kṛṣṇa has spoken, as you have heard it from your spiritual master. Then you are instructing people in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and thus you are their teacher.

Everyone understands how important preaching is. As Prabhupāda used to say, "One who has life, he can preach.” Once he said, “Without this preaching, there will be no more 'Hari Hari bol.” Preaching puts you on the transcendental platform. It brings you beyond the influence of the miserable conditions of material life. It is the life of all knowledge. One cannot even remember what he has read in Śrīla Prabhupāda's books unless he preaches it to others. When we read and preach then the knowledge becomes quickly realized and we remember it better.

But Prabhupāda said more than this. Although everything we have mentioned so far is correct, Prabhupāda has used the word “essence.” This word has very deep meanings and should be examined further. The dictionary has the following to say about the word:

<strong>es·sence</strong> <em>n.</em> 1. something that is, or exists; entity; 2. that which makes something what it is; intrinsic, fundamental nature or most important quality (of something); essential being; 3. a) a substance that keeps, in concentrated form, the flavor, fragrance, or other properties of the plant, drug, food, etc. from which it is extracted; essential oil; 4. Philos. a) the inward nature of anything, underlying its manifestations; true substance; b) the indispensable conceptual characteristics and relations of anything.

Just see how these dictionary definitions clearly expand the meaning of the phrase "Preaching is the essence.” First of all, by preaching one exists. This could be defined as existing in the vision of Kṛṣṇa; in other words, one who preaches becomes recognized by <em>guru</em> and Kṛṣṇa and receives their mercy. Further, when you preach you can also remain a devotee. It is hard to stay fixed up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless you have some connection to preaching. Preaching is what makes Kṛṣṇa consciousness what it is, that is to say, it brings the life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to a devotee, who then becomes absorbed in transcendental devotional service. It is the fundamental principle of ISKCON, the essential element that distinguishes ISKCON from the other societies in the world today. The specific quality of Prabhupāda's ISKCON is that it is above and beyond anything else a preaching movement. We are not interested in being a movement of idle armchair speculators who are unconcerned with the sufferings of the people of the world. Therefore the essential ingredient in ISKCON that makes it what it is, is the preaching that we do by the very nature and structure of ISKCON. In other words, ISKCON is meant to be a preaching movement, and therefore all managerial arrangements should be directed toward preaching and supporting the preaching.

subsub=Utility Is the Principle

<strong>util·i·ty</strong> <em>n</em>. 1. the quality or property of being useful; usefulness; 2. something useful; adj. 1. serving or designed for practical use with little or no attention to beauty 2. useful or used in a number of ways.

Prabhupāda used to say, “Do the needful.” Whatever was required to spread the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was considered needful and something that should be done. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also said that things favorable to Kṛṣṇa consciousness are to be accepted while things unfavorable are to be rejected. When Prabhupāda used the word "utility,” he referred to the quality of a thing or action useful to the spreading of the preaching mission. Prabhupāda was a very practical person. He had the most extraordinary sense of what was relevant at a particular time, place, and circumstance. Therefore, he utilized everything according to its usefulness for the preaching. And this was the principle he followed.

<strong>prin·ci·ple</strong> <em>n</em>. 1. the ultimate source, origin, or cause of something; 2. a natural or original tendency, faculty, or endowment; 3. a fundamental truth, law, doctrine, or motivating force, upon which others are based [moral principles); 4. a) a rule of conduct, esp. of right conduct; b) such rules collectively; c) adherence to them; integrity; uprightness [a man of principle]; 5. an essential element, constituent, or quality, esp. one that produces a specific effect [the active principle of a medicine].

Prabhupāda considered utility so important that he called it our “principle.” Therefore it is a fundamental truth in our movement that we do whatever is required to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One vivid example of this is something that happened when we were in Mauritius with Śrīla Prabhupāda in the southern hemisphere winter of 1975, trying to secure visas and a means to enter South Africa, which was then following the policy of apartheid. We were discussing how to enter the country. At that time Śrīla Prabhupāda said that if it were necessary to enter the country in civilian clothes, he would be willing to do that. I had never seen Śrīla Prabhupāda wearing anything but a <em>dhotī</em>, but he was so eager to preach to the fallen souls of South Africa that he was willing to wear <em>karmi</em> clothes to enter the country. Although he ultimately did not have to do that and they accepted him in his <em>sādhu</em> dress while we entered separately in <em>karmi</em> clothes, still he made clear the point that preaching was the essence and utility the principle, and therefore he was ready to do something unusual for the sake of the mission.

Prabhupāda often showed this in his early days of establishing ISKCON. For example, never before were women allowed to live in the <em>āśramas</em> of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Generally they would live at home with their husbands and family, or if they were to have an <em>āśrama</em>, it would be separated physically from the male <em>āśramas</em>. Prabhupāda knew that in the Western world, men and women were accustomed to intermingle without restriction, so he considered that he would also have to let them join and live within the temple, although this might cause some problems later. Thus we have the famous <em>brahmacāriṇi-āśrama</em>, which so disturbed some persons in India. Prabhupāda explained in his books that one cannot change the social customs of a country overnight, and therefore to keep pace with the so-called culture of the West, he allowed the ladies, who he considered valuable members of the society, to live in ISKCON.

So it is forever established in ISKCON, because of Prabhupāda's third <em>sūtra</em>, that utility, or doing the needful, is our principle of action. We can see this manifested today in our usage of computers, electronic communication, and all types of machines in the service of the Lord. Although <em>sannyāsīs</em> generally had nothing in the way of material possessions and didn't even wear shoes, what to speak of a watch, Prabhupāda engaged his <em>sannyāsīs</em> in preaching with all paraphernalia considered required. Sometimes he would be very happy to hear how they were making traveling buses that would take the Deities on tour and allow the people to see Them in their own lands. Prabhupāda was very happy to see high technology used to produce his books to the acceptable standards of the modern times. He encouraged us in every way to utilize the facilities of the material world to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He even once stated that were we to have nationwide TV programs regularly appearing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness would become popular within a very short time. Although coming from the conservative social structure of India, Prabhupāda was always ready to do whatever was required to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore this movement has become what it is today.

subsub=Purity Is the Force

If one wishes to have spiritual potency, he has to be pure. Although this statement is axiomatic, sometimes it is forgotten by devotees temporarily bewildered by the influence of lust, anger, and greed. It is very difficult to become Kṛṣṇa conscious if one is not following the regulative principles. We must always be on guard to make sure that we do not eat meat, fish, eggs, or anything not offered properly to Kṛṣṇa; that we avoid all forms of illicit sex, real or artificial; that we do not take intoxication of any kind; and that we do not gamble. One who strictly follows these rules is strong in devotional life, but those who break these rules are always weak and full of doubts.

Purity does not only mean following the regulative principles, for one must become pure in mind as well. If one externally follows the principles, yet within always dwells on the objects of sense gratification, he is called a pretender. Such a person will have a hard time to ultimately maintain the principles; when the opportunity arises, he may fall down. Therefore one has to be pure both in body and mind.

To do this, one should make sure that he follows the programs in the temple, or makes programs in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> van. One should follow the schedules of the programs, at least from <em>maṅgala-ārati</em> until <em>prasādam</em> time, for this will help one attain spiritual power and energy. The most important activity of the day is chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mahā-mantra</em>, at least sixteen rounds, with attention and enthusiasm. If one can hear while chanting his rounds, he will have a beneficial, favorable day in devotional life. Kṛṣṇa is pleased with the person who can hear His holy name with attention. Chanting carelessly will not help one advance very quickly in devotional life. One requires the spiritual energy that comes from associating with Kṛṣṇa's holy name, and when one can do this properly, he can accomplish remarkable things for the satisfaction of the Lord.

Purity also means intellectual purity. Kṛṣṇa states at the end of the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> that anyone who studies this sacred conversation worships Him with his intelligence. Therefore it is the duty of everyone to read Śrīla Prabhupāda's books every day for a fixed duration of time. If one reads the Vedic scriptures for one or two hours a day, his intelligence will develop and he will become free from doubts and anxiety for gain and safety. One can become completely free from all sinful reactions when these reactions are burnt to ashes in the fire of devotional knowledge.

The dictionary defines "force" as either strength and power, or action being taken physically against others:

<strong>force</strong> <em>n.</em> 1. strength; energy; vigor; power; 2. the intensity of power; impetus [the force of a blow]; 3. a) physical power or strength exerted against a person or thing [to use force in opening a door]; b) the use of physical power to overcome or restrain a person; physical coercion; violence [to resort to force in dispersing a mob]; 4. the power of a person to act effectively and vigorously; moral or intellectual strength [force of character].

All these definitions fit one who is pure. Purity is the force from all these different points of view. Purity means strength and power, as well as the ability to exert his will over others and conquer them, for one who is pure can, by his spiritual strength, capture the hearts of those who take shelter of him. By his spiritual strength, he can deliver the conditioned souls from the grips of <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em> is so powerful that she can capture everyone, but the devotee is so powerful that he can break <em>māyā's</em> hold over the conditioned soul and deliver him back to Godhead.

It takes vast armies of men, well equipped with all forms of weapons, to conquer a nation. But we can see from the examples of Lord Caitanya and Śrīla Prabhupāda that from the force of purity, numberless living entities can be delivered from the clutches of <em>māyā</em> and return home, back to Godhead. Lord Caitanya saved all of India by His preaching purity. This purity makes one the most potent preacher. Because of this purity, Śrīla Prabhupāda was able to attract so many young people who ordinarily had no attraction to religious activities.

Although Prabhupāda was externally an old man who had no physical resources or strength, he was the most powerful because he had Kṛṣṇa, and thus he had the spiritual force required to melt our stonelike hearts and minds.

If we want to become successful preachers, we must always remember that it is not only a function of endeavor. Endeavor is good, and endeavor for Kṛṣṇa is purifying, but one must have spiritual purity to get the strength required to save the fallen souls. Those who go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> must always remember that without purity, there is no strength, and without strength, there is no potency. Everyone has the experience of being useless on the street. This is because of impurity. If one can always remain pure, he will always have the potency to distribute books and attract people to Kṛṣṇa.

Books are the basis, but purity is the force. It is not possible to go on distributing books for a longer period of time unless one is pure. Therefore we can see how the older <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees have developed such nice, clean hearts through their intense endeavor to distribute Śrīla Prabhupāda's books.

Even if one is not distributing books but is supporting the book distribution by raising funds to allow the book distributors to be free from the worries of making <em>lakṣmī</em>, or if one is supporting the distributors by carrying their books, cleaning their clothes, or cooking for them, one can become pure solely by serving this <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission. And then, regardless of one's service, he will have the spiritual strength to go on with his service for his entire life, always advancing toward the goal of love of Godhead as a personal servitor of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual world. Therefore, let us develop purity of heart through this preaching mission, and while delivering the people of this world, let us move forward together on the path of devotional service.
