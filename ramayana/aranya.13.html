<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="txt">Rama requests Sage Agastya to indicate a place in the forest to make a residence during the days of exile. Sage Agastya foresees the
next course of Ramayana, and orients his conversation around womanhood and Seetha. Then that sage informs Rama to proceed to Panchavati where Seetha
will be delightful of its surroundings.</p>

anxiousness to get some rest. Thus, they are either wet with sweat or also anxious to get rest after a long trek in woods.</p>

<p class="comment">Rama wanted a place with 'many forests,' which is non-conditional to his exile. Some versions contain after <em>dharma ātmā</em>
, and said <em>tato vācha vacaḥ subham</em>. This will not appear in critical or eastern recessions. For this <em>dīraḥ dhīra taram vacaḥ</em> ,
is there. It is said, that sage Agastya contemplated for a while, and envisioning the future of Seetha's abduction and Rama's elimination of Ravana
etc by his yogic power, he said to Rama to stay at Panchavati. This is because, he himself is courageous sage in eliminating the demons, trusting
that Rama also will do the same, he has shown a place which has many forests' around it, that too as Rama desired.</p>
