<h3>Chapter [Sarga] 41<br>
Verses converted to UTF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Maareecha dissuades Ravana again and warns him of the fatal consequences if Rama is irked by the wrongdoings of Ravana. In every
utterance, Maareecha repeats that not only Ravana but the entire demonic race is also going to ruin due to Ravana's impertinence. Finally when Ravana
is heedless of these advises, Maareecha prepares himself to die by the arrow of an enemy, namely Rama, rather than by his own clansman, Ravana.</p>

another word taken as a synonym <em>kiirti</em>. For this Rama Tilaka says: <em>yashaH sva desha 
khyaati, kiirti deshaantara khyaati</em>. Thus <em>&#39;yashas </em>is the fame within one&#39;s own country 
and <em>kiirti </em>is cross-country fame. For this, another ancient commentator Kulluka Bhatt says:
<em>jiivataH khyaati ruupam yashaH, mR^itasya khyaati ruupaam kiirtim </em>&#39;a living person&#39;s fame 
is <em>yashaH </em>and a dead person fame is <em>kiirti </em>Because Ravana is alive and Maareecha

underneath a palm tree to take shelter from the scorching sun, as there are no other shady trees. At the same time a crow swooped down on to the tip
of the tree, by which a palm fruit, as big and weighty as a small pinball fell on the head of fox by the swoop of the crow, and then the misery of
that fox is unexplainable. The sitting of fox, swoop of crow, fall of fruit are all at a time and thus none can blame the other. This syndrome is
named for such fortuitous happenings.</p>
