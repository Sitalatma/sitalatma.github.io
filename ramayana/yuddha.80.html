Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana instructs Indrajit to proceed to the battle field. Before proceeding t the battle, Indrajit performs ceremorial oblations into
a sacred fire and obtains a capacity of going out of sight while fighting. He proceeds to the battle-field and releases a flood of arrows towards
Rama and Lakshmana, while himself remaining invisible in the sky. With a network of arrows, Indrajit creates a darkness in the sky and showers a
multitude of steel arrows towards Rama and Lakshmana. Sharp golden shafts arrows are then released by Rama and Lakshmana. Struck by the arrows
discharged by Indrajit, monkeys in hundreds fall down dead. Then, Rama and Lakshmana reflect on the various ways and means to destroy Indrajit.</p>
