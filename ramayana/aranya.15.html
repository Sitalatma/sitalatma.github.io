<p class="comment">
Other versions read the <em>jala rāmaṇyakam</em> as <em>sthala rāmaṇyakam</em>. Rama desires a place 
that shall be scenic with flower gardens where Seetha can easily pluck flowers in those gardens. And 
it shall be a pleasurable garden for him to recline, or take his bath etc., and thirdly it shall contain 
the ritual paraphernalia within the reach of Lakshmana, so that Lakshmana can provide them to Rama in 
time, with his obedient service.</p>

Rama, therefore you yourself tell me to build hermitage in such and such delightful place. [3-15-7]</p>

<p class="comment">
Lakshmana is an ever adherent of the Supreme Vishnu as he is the thousand-headed serpent namely <em>
ādi sheṣha</em>, on which Vishnu reclines. Even in this incarnation of Rama, Lakshmana says he is the 
same adherent. Thus Lakshmana wants Rama not to say &#39;you do it your way&#39; but to order &#39;you do it my 
way.&#39; Further, Lakshmana is saying this in presence of Seetha, <em>sītā samakṣe</em>, because if she 
is not going to accept that place, Rama rejects it. Hence, it firstly is the choice of Seetha on which 
Rama&#39;s approval will be automatic. Thus the question of agreeability or disagreeability of Lakshmana 
does not arise. &#39;Even in this incarnation in the dynasty of Kakutstha as Rama, I am still subservient 
to you, as I was in <em>vaikuṇṭha</em> , as <em>ādi sheṣa</em> . And this <em>tvayi varṣa shatam sthite</em> 
: <em>shata</em> is lexically a hundred but also used in its infinitude, thus &#39;I am anytime servant 
of yours.&#39; <em>svayam tu ruchire deshe</em> : &#39;Your choice of place is but my pleasure.&#39; This is to 
portray the self-denial of Lakshmana, apart from any individual identity let alone the devotee status, 
total dedication <em>kainkarya</em>, to the Supreme. This is according to Govindaraja.</p>

<p class="comment">
Adherent nature of Lakshmana is also like that of a younger brother towards his elder brother, for the 
elder brother becomes father-like after the demise of their father. <em>anenapiturantaram yāvat jyeṣhṭho 
jīvati tāvat kaniṣhṭhasya na svātantryam itisūcitam | tathā ca manuḥ piteva pālayat sutān jyeṣhṭha

&quot;This pleasing lake is seen here adjacently, beaming forth with its lotuses that are similar to sun 
in resplendence, and that are scented fragrantly. [3-5-11]</p>

<p class="comment">
The Lake is beaming with lotuses that have the resplendence of Sun. Sun is Vishnu&#39;s another aspect,
<em>sūrya nārāyaṇa</em> , and hence that Vishnu is here in the form of lake. The lotus is the abode 
of Goddess Lakshmi and the lake is full with such lotuses, which are in the heart of the lake. As such 
Goddess Lakshmi is in the lotuses, which again are situated in the heart of Vishnu, and hence this is 
a propitious lake to have Vishnu and Lakshmi together.</p>

<p class="comment">
The <em>gava aksha</em> is cow-eye, meaning the cow-eye shaped ventilators of walls. The <em>bhakti</em> 
is the name for coloured graphical drawings on the body of elephants. Apart from the howdah and other 
ornamentations, the elephants are richly painted in colours during ceremonial occasions, even today. 
As such Rama is visualising the ore deposits on the mountains as cow-eye like ventilators on walls, 
and as superb streaks of paintings on the bodies of elephants.</p>

[3-15-29]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>bhāvajñaḥ</em> means here as the knower of other&#39;s feelings. Lakshmana is well aware of 
such things while talking with sages, his brothers, his mothers and his ministers like Hanuma and other 
subjects. Here also Lakshmana knew the feelings of Rama as to how the cottage is envisioned by Rama, 
with due privacy to Rama and Seetha, with a porch, worship-room, and an accommodation for himself.
<em>kṛitajña</em> is masterly craftsmanship and flair for doing all deeds of sublime nature, but not 
&#39;faithful&#39; in routine sense. <em>dharmajñaḥ</em> is knower of honesty. Though he himself is a prince, 
Lakshmana did not construct the cottage for his comfort, but the convenience of Rama and Seetha are 
counted firstly. The word <em>dharmātmā</em> , virtue souled one, can also be prefixed to Dasharatha 
like <em>dharmātmā mama pitā</em> virtue-souled, my, father, meaning that &#39;the virtue-souled Dasharatha 
has left you behind him for my sake, because you are arranging all the things for me, as a father would 
naturally do for his son.&#39; The word <em>sam vṛittaḥ</em> in the observation of Dr. Satya Vrat in his 
book &#39;The Ramayana - A Linguistic Study is:--  This word has been found used in a rather remarkable sense 
[in Ramayana.] It is &#39;to die&#39;. <em>sam vṛittaḥ</em> means dead. Ordinarily <em>samvṛittaḥ</em> has 
quite the opposite sense, viz., &#39;born&#39;, i.e., father Dasharatha took rebirth as Lakshmana, to provide 
for the needs of Rama.</p>

<p class="comment">
And Dharmākūtam says that, <em>anena 
mṛite api pitādhārmikeṇa putreṇa amṛita iti sūcitam | tathā ca vājasaneya brāhmaṇa~N-- &#39;saputreṇa

The last word <em>sukhī</em> is read as <em>vashī</em> in other mms meaning that Rama &#39;with his senses
