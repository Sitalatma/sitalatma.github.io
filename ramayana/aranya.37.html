<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">ṃāreecha advises Ravana to stay away from Rama with his own unpleasant experience with Rama's arrow when he was in Tataka forest, and
portrays a gruesome picture of Rama to Ravana, asking him to not to meddle with Rama's affairs.</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>1. rākṣasa indrasya</em> = demons, chief's; <em>tat vākyam shrutvā</em> = that, sentence - that idea of abduction, on
hearing; <em>vākya vishāradaḥ</em> = sentence-making, expert in [articulator]; <em>mahā prāGYaḥ</em> = well-informed; <em>mārīcaḥ</em> =
ṃāreecha; <em>rākṣasa īshvaram</em> = to demons, lord; <em>prati uvāca</em> = in reply, spoke - replied.</p>
<p class="tat">
On hearing that idea of the chief of demons Ravana in abducting Seetha, ṃāreecha, a well-informed one and an articulator spoke to the
lord of demons in reply. [3-37-1]</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>2. rājan</em> = oh, king; <em>priya vādinaḥ puruṣā</em> = pleasantly, talking, people; <em>satatam sulabhāḥ</em> =
always, easy - easy to get; <em>a priyasya</em> = of un, pleasant - judgementally; <em>pathyasya ca</em> = recuperative insipid diet-like
[suggestions,] also; <em>vaktā</em> = who speaks them; or even; <em>shrotā ca</em> = listener, also; <em>dur labhaḥ</em> = not, possible -
impossible to get.</p>
<p class="tat">
"It will always be easy to get people who talk pleasantly, oh, king, but it is impossible to get them who talk judgementally and give
suggestions that may be apparently insipid, but that are recuperative, more so, it is impossible to get listeners of such advises. [3-37-2]</p>
<p class="comment">There are many who render advises without weighing pros and cons, but just to
get along and please their master. There will be none to suggest expeditiously, though that
suggestion presently will be unpleasant and unsavoury like a recuperative insipid diet, but in
reality, it is result-oriented. Even if such an advisor suggests in earnest, he will have no
listener who listens earnestly and effectuates it. So, listen to my words that may now be
unsavoury, but will prove beneficial to you in long run, if you can foresee your future properly.
Dharmākūtam says: <em>anena sva prayojana virodha sankayā rāja buddhi anusāreṇa vaktāro 
mantriṇaḥ sulabhāḥ - kintu anartha paryavasāyino rājabuddhim tiraskritya shubhodarka vaktāro 
mantriṇo durlabhā iti sūcitam </em>- then the commentator goes on to quote vidura nīti from ṃaha Bharata, wherein it
is said: <em>yo hi dharma samāshritya hatvā bhatruḥ priyārthe | apriyāṇi āha pathyāni tena 
rājā sahāyavān || sulabhāḥ puruṣā rājan satatam priya vādinaḥ | apriyasya ca pathyasya 
vaktā shrotā ca durlabhaḥ ||</em>&nbsp; The last two foots may be observed because they are similar to the above
verse of Ramayana, by such similarities some hold the opinion that ṃaha Bharata is an explanation
to Ramayana.</p>

<p class="tat">
"Definitely you do not apperceive Rama who is decidedly dynamic and exaltedly adept, for you are impetuous and desultory in dealing

"Oh, boy, will there be safety to all demons on earth? Or, that highly enraged Rama will render this world de-demonised! [3-37-4]</p>
<p class="comment">'...but for you...' 'Will you let the demons on earth live, or, would like to eradicate them through Rama, through your

upturned their functions. Then, is it possible to Ravana and hosts of his demonic-adherents to thrive in an unnatural gloom? This is the doubt of

of that couple like that of Sun and his wife Prabha, as said earlier by ṃāreecha. Seetha is not 
directly said by her name but her father Janaka&#39;s name is brought in, because Janaka is both a <em>
rājarṣi </em>and <em>brahmarṣi </em>Kingly-saint and Brahman-sage, as well. And Janaka is capable 
of saying <em>idam brahmam idam kshātram shāpat api sharāt api </em>&#39;here is Brahma-hood and here 
is Kshatriya-hood, either by malediction or by arrow, whichever meetly of you, you can confront me.&#39; 
This apart, it is said that &#39;a pertinent devotion to a god makes the devotee like that god alone.&#39;
<em>shraddhayā devo devatvam ashnute </em>and Seetha is the devotee of Rama and she became one with 
Rama. Thereby, there is twofold resplendence, namely, that of Rama and that of Seetha, so it is 
inapt of you to make any useless effort when everything is firewalled.</p>
