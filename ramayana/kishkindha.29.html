<br><h3>Book IV : Kishkindha Kanda - The Empire of Holy ṃonkeys</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 29<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
<p class="txt">
Sugreeva on his enthronement and gaining an interval of rainy reason, lapses into lavish enjoyment of sensual 
pleasures. His indulgence becomes overindulgence and makes him to forget his promise-oriented duty to search for 
Seetha. As an intelligent minister, Hanuma approaches Sugreeva and enlightens Sugreeva about his duty for the 
requital of help rendered by Rama. Ordering Nīla, a commander of monkey forces, for foregathering all monkey 
troops within fifteen days, Sugreeva re-enters his palace-chambers, dragged by his sensual pleasures.</p>

Here Hanuma is indirectly reprimanding Sugreeva for his lascivious way of living forgetting Rama&#39;s work. This 
can be said this way also in a general tone: &quot;No misfortune can constrain him who strives enthusiastically and 
expeditiously for his friend&#39;s mission.&quot; But Hanuma&#39;s dutifulness is to be kept in view.</p>

being&#39;s group, if they tread the path of virtuousness, thus he is the sustainer of universe in peace. Any violator 
to that peaceful coexistence will be put to an end, may it be Viradha, Kabandha, Vali or Ravana.</p>

<p class="comment">
Here it is said that Sugreeva re-entered his palace-chambers. This is due to the impulsive nature towards his 
sensual gratifications. He should have realised that he shall approach Rama to report the arrangements made, or 
at least he should have asked Hanuma to inform Rama about these orders to Nīla. Without doing either of them, 
he re-entered the palace-chambers by which Hanuma has landed into a dilemma. Hanuma cannot go to Rama on his own 
for he is a minister of Sugreeva and inform about the orders of Sugreeva to Nīla without the permission of the 
king, namely Sugreeva, nor as a minister, he can persuade Sugreeva to go to Rama to report the actions taken by 
monkey forces to search Seetha. In reality, monkey forces are being gathered, but that information is not passed 
on to Rama. This communication gap creates a furious emotion in Rama and he bids Lakshmana to go to Kishkindha 
and take Sugreeva to task, and even Lakshmana jumps on Sugreeva like a firebrand, in the coming chapters.</p>
