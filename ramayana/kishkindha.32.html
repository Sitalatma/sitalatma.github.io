<h3>Introduction</h3>
<br>
<p class="txt">
Sugreeva is disturbed at the unfounded anger of Lakshmana and wanted his ministers to elicit the cause for that 
anger. Hanuma informs Sugreeva that causing delay is the only fault of Sugreeva, for which Sugreeva is advised 
to pray for the mercy of Lakshmana personally.</p>

<em>iti cintaye</em> = thus, it is being thought - by me.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;I have not in the least spoken any ill of them, nor committed any misdeed in their respect, thus I am thinking 
why should Raghava&#39;s brother Lakshmana take offence at me? [4-32-3]</p>

<strong>Sloka 6</strong></p>

<p class="Romsloka">

<p class="tat">
&quot;Definitely there is no fear for me from Lakshmana, not even from Raghava, but an unfounded ire of a friend alone 
is giving rise to disquiet. [4-32-6]</p>

<p class="comment">
The word <em>a + sthāna kupitam - a + sthāna kopam</em>, is twofold in its meaning, one is &#39;unfounded anger&#39; and the 
other is &#39;angered out of place, context.&#39; Lakshmana who has so far not visited Kishkindha has darted into Kishkindha 
and showing his ire here, which is out of context. Lakshmana should have summoned Sugreeva or any other monkey, 
or he should have come as a calm and collected emissary, and then he can become ireful if Sugreeva rejects any 
help. But Lakshmana&#39;s entry itself is &#39;unfounded or unreasonable.&#39; This one statement of Sugreeva makes him lofty 
of virtue in his heart of hearts for he reposed full confidence in Rama and thus fearless of a trusted friend.</p>

&quot;It is always practicable to befriend any, but in turn it is impracticable to manage that friendship, even a trifle 
splits off that friendliness for sentiments are transient. [4-32-7]</p>

<strong>Sloka 8</strong></p>

Sugreeva is ascribed as a great disciplinarian and punctualist and his order 
<em>sugrīva ājña</em> &#39; Sugreeva&#39;s order...&#39;

<p class="pratipada">
<em>20. pūrva upakāram smaratā</em> = earlier, beneficence, remembering; <em>visheṣataḥ kṛitajñena</em> = 
especially, as one beholden to him; such as you are, by you; <em>yaḥ</em> = he who is - Rama; <em>punaḥ prasādya</em> 
= [time and ] again, who is to be placated; <em>saḥ</em> = he; <em>kopayitum</em> = to be infuriated; <em>na kṣamaḥ 
bhavet</em> = not, seemly, it becomes.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;It becomes unseemly to infuriate him who is to be placated time and again, especially when remembering his earlier 
beneficence to you and when you are beholden to him. [4-32-20]</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>21. rājan</em> = oh, king; <em>sa putraḥ sa su hṛit janaḥ</em> = along with, son, with, kind, hearted, people 
[friends and relatives]; <em>tvam</em> = you; <em>tasya</em> = to him; <em>mūrdhnā praṇamya</em> = with forehead, 
pay deference - prostrate yourself; <em>sva samaye</em> = in your own, accord; you stay; like; <em>bhartuḥ bhāryā 
iva</em> = for husband, wife, as with; <em>tat vashe tiṣṭha</em> = in his, control, you stay - remain under his 
auspices.</p>

&quot;Prostrate yourself before him along with your son, friends and relatives to pay deference, oh, king, and abide

na rāma rāmānuja śāsanam tvayā<br>kapīndra yuktam manasā api apohitum |<br>mano hi te jñāsyati mānuṣam balam<br>
sa rāghavasya asya surendra varcasaḥ || 4-32-22</p>

<p class="pratipada">
<em>22. kapīndra</em> = oh, monkeys, king; <em>rāma rāma anuja shāsanam</em> = Rama&#39;s, Rama&#39;s, brother&#39;s, 
ruling; <em>tvayā</em> = by you; <em>manasā api</em> = at heart, even - even in imagination; <em>apohitum</em> 
= to set aside - keep it at bay, fend off; <em>na yuktam</em> = not, seemly; <em>saḥ rāghavasya</em> = together 
with, the legatee of Raghu - here, Lakshmana; <em>surendra varcasaḥ</em> = king of gods, Indra, having resplendence;
<em>asya</em> = his, Rama&#39;s; <em>mānuṣam balam</em> = humanly, tenacity [keeping a firm hold of principles, life];
<em>te manaḥ jñāsyati hi</em> = your, heart, knows it, isn&#39;t it.</p>

<p class="tat">
&quot;It will be unseemly to fend off the ruling of Rama, or of his brother Lakshmana even in your imagination, oh, 
king of monkeys, as your heart is aware of the humanly tenacity of that Rama, whose resplendence vies with that 
of Indra, and who is associated with selfsame Lakshmana, isn&#39;t it.&quot; Thus Hanuma spoke to Sugreeva. [4-32-22]</p>

<p class="comment">
For the usage of words <em>mānuṣam balam</em> it is said as &#39;his humanly adventures are already known to you, yet his 
divine expeditions are to be known by you.&#39;</p>
