Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Ravana rebuts ṃāreecha for giving an unasked advice and details his plan to abduct Seetha. Ravana intimidates ṃāreecha that he
himself will kill ṃāreecha immediately if his orders are disobeyed, and ṃāreecha may perhaps have no opportunity to die at the hands of Rama.</p>

held by hair and taught, as a teacher holds the taught by his tuft of hair to earbash. Likewise an
upright minister shall counsel the king properly, as Krishna advises Vidura in ṃaha Bharata at
