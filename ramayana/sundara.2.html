<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>

<h3>chapter [Sarga] 2<br>Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">This chapter introduces us to the glorious city of Lanka and Hanuma&#39;s first encounter with it. 
The geography around the island where Lanka is located is described herein. The chapter also depicts the initial 
reaction of Hanuma on seeing the city and his initial thoughts about the feasibility of the task of overcoming 
the Rakshasas and Ravana to reunite Sri Rama with mother Seetha. As the book progresses, we shall see how Hanuma 
overcomes these thoughts and moves toward achieving this task.</p>

<p class="tat">ṭhe glorious ḥanuma with the best courage, even though crossing a hundred yojanas, was without 
a sigh and did not obtain any tiredness.</p>

<p class="comment">Comment : This verse and others clearly mention that Hanuma crossed an ocean of hundred yojanas. 
At the present time the shore to shore distance between southern tip of India and Northern tip of Sri Lanka is 
around sixty miles. Even with a measure of 2.5 miles per yojana, hundred yojanas translate to 250 miles. To explain 
this anomaly, we need to consider that around the time of Ramayana, the distance was lot more than the current 
sixty miles. This is in sync with the current theories by geologists that the ocean between India and the current 
Sri Lanka had been replaced by land mass over a period of time. ṃost of the land to the south of current Raghunatha 
Pura had been covered by landmass in antiquity. Also according to Ramayana, the mountains Trikuta, Lamba and Suvela 
were to the north of Lanka, but currently the mountains are found in the southern part of Lanka. This suggests 
that the northern parts of current Lanka were submerged in water during the Ramayana period.</p>
