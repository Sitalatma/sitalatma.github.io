couch, taking it out from the vessel where it had been immersed in oil and proceeds with the funeral rites. The appointed priests, attendants, people
of the city and the weeping royal women followed the funeral pile of the king to the banks of Sarayu River where the body was cremated. Bharata along
with others return to the city after the completion of the cremation-ceremony.</p>
