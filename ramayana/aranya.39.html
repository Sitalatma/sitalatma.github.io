gingerly, but the other two demons were killed. [4-39-13]</p>
<p class="comment">Here the action of Rama's arrow is indicated. Rama's arrow will not shoot at the back of the opponent or it backstabs either. Even
when killing Vali, though Rama is not affronting Vali, Rama's arrow pierced Vali's chest. Here because ṃāreecha is retreating, that third arrow of
Rama did not kill ṃāreecha but followed him in a chasing manner. But the other two demons unknowing about Rama's arrow, they confronted him and the
other two arrows eliminated them. There is discussion on the word shaṭhaḥ 'one capable to trick' used in the verse as some mms employ the word
sharaḥ, 'an arrow.' In this section vividly explainable verses are there in some ancient versions of mms. This particular verse reads like this in
them: <em>parākramajño rāmasya tathā dṛiṣṭa bhayaḥ purā | āpatantam sharam 

dṛiṣṭvā megha ga.mbhīra nissvanam || tato aham vegavān tatra vāta.mhā 

nimeshataḥ | apa krānta param pāram nivṛittaḥ sāgarāt sharaḥ ||</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am in the know of Rama's valour, and I am also in the know of what fear he caused in an earlier instance, and on seeing the
arrows coming upon like thunderous clouds, in a wink I escaped to the other side of ocean, and Rama's arrow having come chasing me up to ocean-shore
returned.' In here, the efficacy of Rama's arrow is clearly narrated and it is not clear why pundits did not consider these verses of ancient mms
instead of the above verse.</p>

queen are playing dice game. When Ravana entered, the dice in the hand of Bali has slipped to the floor, and Bali asks Ravana to pick and give it
before conquering netherworld. Ravana who lifted ṃt. Kailash could not lift that two-inch dice, which is so far handled playfully by Bali. Such is
