<h3>Book III : Aranya Kanda - The Forest
Trek</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 54<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Seetha drops her ornaments at Sugreeva and other monkeys available on a mountaintop during the course of her abduction. Ravana does
not take notice of this as he is hurrying as though haunted by Rama. On crossing the southerly ocean, his jitteriness in stealing Seetha ceases and
he hypocritically feels elated in gaining both Seetha and an animosity with Rama.</p>

dropped. The Indian <font color="#B3003A">sari</font> worn by those women of yore was in a different fashion, where they wore <font color=
"#B3003A">sari</font> like the present day <font color="#B3003A">dhoti</font> with pleated back stuffing like men, but they also used an upper cloth
enough to cover their busts. A three-piece dress is a must, either to man or a woman in Indian style. It comprises of a loincloth dhoti or sari, and
a shirt-like or a jacket-like bust cover, and an upper-cloth to hang on the shoulder to men or to muffle the bust for women. So some say the whole of
upper cloth of Seetha is dropped bundled with ornaments.</p>

thievishness' haunts him. But Seetha is on his flank and under his arm, her trunk turned against his. Then she shortly saw the oddish Vanara-s, who
look unlike ordinary monkeys, but with some presumably pro-human and non-demonic features, yet monkeyish with some regality, and then she quickly
plucked off her ornaments and upcast her upper-cloth, and hastily but carefully, bundled her jewellery and downcast that bundle at them.</p>

the Vanara-s are said to be bulishly impetuous beings and if so, could they not have averted or countered Ravana - will be the question. It is a
regular scene for them to see this skywalker demon to carry off such goddess like ladies and they have seen many women thus carried off. But this
particular one is appearing to be somewhat different, more over she is repeatedly calling for some 'Rama...' and she is wriggling in that demon's
capture. They know this demon to be Ravana and they even know of the alliance of Ravana with Vali. If these handfuls of vanara-s dare Ravana, they
die at the hands of Ravana instead at the hand of Vali. Hence, they remained silent spectators to save themselves. This is why Sugreeva did not
indicate the way Seetha in which was abducted by 'some' demon, to Rama, in Kishkindha, when they firstly met.</p>

<div id="btn5" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">This verse has some divergences from the viewpoints of commentators.
Govindaraja's text uses <em>māyām iva striyam</em> while Tilaka uses <em>mayaḥ māyām iva
āsurīm</em> thereby the word 'āsurrīm...' suggests that Ravana brought a <em>māyā sīta</em>
'an illusory Seetha...' instead of original Seetha, which original Seetha is said to have been in
safe keeping of Ritual-fire until the elimination of Ravana, and comes out of the same Ritual-fire
after the elimination of Ravana. A very big controversy surrounds this statement and whole of the
auxiliary Ramayana-s are brought in, along with <em>purāṇa-s,</em> which substantiate this
riddler, <em>māyā sīta.</em></p>
<div id="btn6" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">As it is, we do not find that much debatable aspect in Valmiki Ramayana, if the
statement that 'Ravana placed Seetha in an unapproachable Black Hole like Lanka, as ṃaya once
placed Hema in an unapproachable underground Black Hole...' is taken up. This episode of demon
ṃaya-Hema occurs in Kishkindha, ch. 51, which may please be referred. Then it suffices to satisfy
the verbiage of <em>āsurīm</em>, when the analogy of 1] Lanka of Ravana and <em>ṛiksha
bila,</em> 'Black Hole' of ṃaya, both being the constructions of artifice, and again between 2]
ṃaya, the demon and Ravana, the demon, [that too, the eliminable demons,] 3] nymphet Hema and
nymphal Seetha, [the causative factors for elimination,] and the actual eliminators Indra and Rama,
is taken into consideration.</p>

eyelashes are tear-wet and slanted edge-ward to give a blackish shade at the end of her eyes.</p>

The wording in this verse <em>mohāt mudiataḥ sa rākshasaḥ</em> together with the word <em>hṛiṣṭaḥ 
rāvaṇaḥ</em> at verse 6, is discussed by commentators stating that he is self-conceitedly and hypocritically 
lost in his own hallucinations of possessing Seetha. Tilaka commentary says that bringing Seetha to 
Lanka is a villainous act but not with an iota of reverence to her, when elucidating verse 1 of next 
chapter where it contains: <em>ātmānam buddhi vaiklbyāt kṛita kṛityam amanyata...</em> &#39;he believed 
in his own self that he achieved a great feat, as his brain gone astray foolishly...&#39; But the poet also 
says proximately that he is amused in gaining an <em>archenemy&#39;s animosity,</em> i.e. that of Rama. 
It is therefore said that he is happy as his release from his accursed demon-hood is set to happen soon, 
as he achieved the abduction of Seetha, thus paved way for Rama to come to Lanka to release him from 
his accursed being. This is supported by the statement in verse that Ravana&#39;s words have some <em>mahā 
artham</em> &#39;words with allusion, or secret message&#39; to Rama perhaps, as at verse 29.</p>

of captivated soul, called Seetha, this pleasure seeking <em>manas</em> &#39;heart&#39; also gets released.
