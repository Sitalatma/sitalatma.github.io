        <div id="bb16870" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>At the time of Mahārāja Parīkṣit’s birth, the expert astrologer-<i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> foretold some of his qualities. Mahārāja Parīkṣit developed all those qualities, being a great devotee of the Lord. The real qualification is to become a devotee of the Lord, and gradually all the good qualities worthy of possession develop. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a <i>mahā-bhāgavata, - <span style="color:#990012">มหา-ภาควต,</span></i> or a first-class devotee, who was not only well versed in the science of devotion but also able to convert others to become devotees by his transcendental instructions. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was, therefore, a devotee of the first order, and thus he used to consult great sages and learned <i>brāhmaṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ,</span></i> who could advise him by the <i>śāstras - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ</span></i> how to execute the state administration. Such great kings were more responsible than modern elected executive heads because they obliged the great authorities by following their instructions left in Vedic literatures. There was no need for impractical fools to enact daily a new legislative bill and to conveniently alter it again and again to serve some purpose. The rules and regulations were already set forth by great sages like Manu, Yājñavalkya, Parāśara and other liberated sages, and the enactments were all suitable for all ages in all places. Therefore the rules and regulations were standard and without flaw or defect. Kings like Mahārāja Parīkṣit had their council of advisers, and all the members of that council were either great sages or <i>brāhmaṇas</i> of the first order. They did not accept any salary, nor had they any necessity for such salaries. <i>The state would get the best advice without expenditure. - <span style="color:#990012">เตฺห สฺตเต ลฺทฺ เคตฺ ตฺเห เพสฺตฺ อทฺวิเจ ตฺหโตฺ เอเปนฺทิตุเร.</span></i> They were themselves <i>sama-darśī, - <span style="color:#990012">สม-ทรฺศี,</span></i> equal to everyone, both man and animal. They would not advise the king to give protection to man and instruct him to kill the poor animals. Such council members were not fools or representatives to compose a fool’s paradise. They were all self-realized souls, and they knew perfectly well how all living beings in the state would be happy, both in this life and in the next. They were not concerned with the hedonistic philosophy of eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. They were philosophers in the real sense, and they knew well what is the mission of human life. Under all these obligations, the advisory council of the king would give correct directions, and the king or executive head, being himself a qualified devotee of the Lord, would scrutinizingly follow them for the welfare of the state. The state in the days of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira or Mahārāja Parīkṣit was a welfare state in the real sense of the term because no one was unhappy in that state, be he man or animal. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was an ideal king for a welfare state of the world.</p></div>

He celebrated several sacrifices in the Kurukṣetra pilgrimage site, and he had three younger brothers named Śrutasena, Ugrasena and Bhīmasena II. He invaded Takṣaśilā (Ajanta), and he decided to avenge the unlawful curse upon his great father, Mahārāja Parīkṣit. He performed a great sacrifice called Sarpa-yajña, to kill the race of serpents, including the <i>takṣaka, - <span style="color:#990012">ตกฺษก,</span></i> which had bitten his father to death. On request from many influential demigods and sages, he had to change his decision to kill the race of snakes, but despite stopping the sacrifice, he satisfied everyone concerned in the sacrifice by rewarding them properly. In the ceremony, Mahāmuni Vyāsadeva also was present, and he personally narrated the history of the Battle of Kurukṣetra before the King. Later on by the order of Vyāsadeva, his disciple Vaiśampāyana narrated before the King the subject matter of <i>Mahābhārata. - <span style="color:#990012">มหาภารต.</span></i> He was much affected by his great father’s untimely death and was very anxious to see him again, and he expressed his desire before the great sage Vyāsadeva.

        <div id="bb16881" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It appears from this verse that interplanetary travel by the denizens of higher planets is easy. In many statements in <i>Bhāgavatam, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ,</span></i> we have observed that the demigods from heaven used to visit this earth to attend sacrifices performed by influential kings and emperors. Herein also we find that during the time of the horse sacrifice ceremony of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the demigods from other planets were visible even to the common man, due to the sacrificial ceremony. The demigods are not generally visible to common men, as the Lord is not visible. But as the Lord, by His causeless mercy, descends to be visible to the common man, similarly the demigods also become visible to the common man by their own grace. Although celestial beings are not visible to the naked eyes of the inhabitants of this earth, it was due to the influence of Mahārāja Parīkṣit that the demigods also agreed to be visible. The kings used to spend lavishly during such sacrifices, as a cloud distributes rains. A cloud is nothing but another form of water, or, in other words, the waters of the earth transform into clouds. Similarly, the charity made by the kings in such sacrifices was but another form of the taxes collected from the citizens. But, as the rains fall down very lavishly and appear to be more than necessary, the charity made by such kings also seems to be more than what the citizen needs. Satisfied citizens will never organize agitation against the king, and thus there was no need in changing the monarchial state.</p></div>

        <div id="bb16887" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The purpose of a king’s going out to conquer the world is not for self-aggrandizement. Mahārāja Parīkṣit went out to conquer the world after his ascendance to the throne, but this was not for the purpose of aggression on other states. He was the Emperor of the world, and all small states were already under his regime. His purpose in going out was to see how things were going on in terms of the godly state. The king, being the representative of the Lord, has to execute the will of the Lord duly. There is no question of self-aggrandizement. Thus as soon as Mahārāja Parīkṣit saw that a lower-class man in the dress of a king was hurting the legs of a cow and a bull, at once he arrested and punished him. The king cannot tolerate insults to the most important animal, the cow, nor can he tolerate disrespect for the most important man, the <i>brāhmaṇa. - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ.</span></i> Human civilization means to advance the cause of brahminical culture, and to maintain it, cow protection is essential. There is a miracle in milk, for it contains all the necessary vitamins to sustain human physiological conditions for higher achievements. Brahminical culture can advance only when man is educated to develop the quality of goodness, and for this there is a prime necessity of food prepared with milk, fruits and grains. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was astonished to see that a black <i>śūdra, - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร,</span></i> dressed like a ruler, was mistreating a cow, the most important animal in human society.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16888" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Age of Kali means mismanagement and quarrel. And the root cause of all mismanagement and quarrel is that worthless men with the modes of lower-class men, who have no higher ambition in life, come to the helm of the state management. Such men at the post of a king are sure to first hurt the cow and the brahminical culture, thereby pushing all society towards hell. Mahārāja Parīkṣit, trained as he was, got the scent of this root cause of all quarrel in the world. Thus he wanted to stop it in the very beginning.</p></div>

The scientist, who puts forward the theory of stopping death by advancement of scientific knowledge, becomes himself a victim of death when he is called by Yamarāja. What to speak of stopping death, no one can enhance the short period of life even by a fraction of a moment. The only hope of suspending the cruel slaughtering process of Yamarāja is to call him to hear and chant the holy name of the Lord. Yamarāja is a great devotee of the Lord, and he likes to be invited to <i>kīrtanas - <span style="color:#990012">กีรฺตนสฺ</span></i> and sacrifices by the pure devotees, who are constantly engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Thus the great sages, headed by Śaunaka and others, invited Yamarāja to attend the sacrifice performed at Naimiṣāraṇya. This was good for those who did not want to die.</p></div>

The human form is a special gift of material nature in the course of her enforcing stringent laws of miseries upon the living being. It is a chance to achieve the highest boon of life, namely to get out of the entanglement of repeated birth and death. The intelligent take care of this important gift by strenuously endeavoring to get out of the entanglement. But the less intelligent are lazy and unable to evaluate the gift of the human body to achieve liberation from the material bondage; they become more interested in so-called economic development and work very hard throughout life simply for the sense enjoyment of the temporary body. Sense enjoyment is also allowed to the lower animals by the law of nature, and thus a human being is also destined to a certain amount of sense enjoyment according to his past or present life. But one should definitely try to understand that sense enjoyment is not the ultimate goal of human life. Herein it is said that during the daytime one works “for nothing” because the aim is nothing but sense enjoyment. We can particularly observe how the human being is engaged for nothing in the great cities and industrial towns. There are so many things manufactured by human energy, but they are all meant for sense enjoyment, and not for getting out of material bondage. And after working hard during the daytime, a tired man either sleeps or engages in sex habits at night. That is the program of materialistic civilized life for the less intelligent. Therefore they are designated herein as lazy, unfortunate and short-lived.</p></div>

But he got the news that the symptoms of the Age of Kali had already infiltrated into the jurisdiction of his state, and he did not like this news. What are the symptoms of the Age of Kali? They are (1) illicit connection with women, (2) indulgence in meat-eating, (3) intoxication and (4) taking pleasure in gambling. The Age of Kali literally means the age of quarrel, and the above-mentioned four symptoms in human society are the root causes for all kinds of quarrel. Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard that some of the people of the state had already taken to those symptoms, and he wanted to take immediate steps against such causes of unrest. This means that at least up to the regime of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, such symptoms of public life were practically unknown, and as soon as they were slightly detected, he wanted to root them out. The news was not palatable for him, but in a way it was, because Mahārāja Parīkṣit got a chance to fight. There was no need to fight with small states because everyone was peacefully under his subordination, but the Kali-yuga miscreants gave his fighting spirit a chance for exhibition. A perfect <i>kṣatriya - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span></i> king is always jubilant as soon as he gets a chance to fight, just as a sportsman is eager when there is a chance for a sporting match. It is no argument that in the Age of Kali such symptoms are predestined. If so, then why was there preparation for fighting out such symptoms? Such arguments are offered by lazy and unfortunate men. In the rainy season, rain is predestined, and yet people take precautions to protect themselves. Similarly, in the Age of Kali the symptoms as above mentioned are sure to infiltrate into social life, but it is the duty of the state to save the citizens from the association of the agents of the Age of Kali. Mahārāja Parīkṣit wanted to punish the miscreants indulging in the symptoms of Kali, and thus save the innocent citizens who were pure in habit by culture of religion. It is the duty of the king to give such protection, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit was perfectly right when he prepared himself to fight.</p></div>

        <div id="bb16949" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kings and great personalities of the state are presented with welcome addresses. This is a system from time immemorial, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit, since he was one of the well-known emperors of the world, was also presented with addresses of welcome in all parts of the world as he visited those places. The subject matter of those welcome addresses was Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa means Kṛṣṇa and His eternal devotees, as the king means the king and his confidential associates.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16950" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Kṛṣṇa and His unalloyed devotees cannot be separated, and therefore glorifying the devotee means glorifying the Lord and vice versa. Mahārāja Parīkṣit would not have been glad to hear about the glories of his forefathers like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and Arjuna had they not been connected with the acts of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The Lord descends specifically to deliver His devotees (<i>paritrāṇāya sādhūnām - <span style="color:#990012">ปริตฺราณาย สาธูนามฺ</span></i>). The devotees are glorified by the presence of the Lord because they cannot live for a moment without the presence of the Lord and His different energies. The Lord is present for the devotee by His acts and glories, and therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit felt the presence of the Lord when He was glorified by His acts, especially when he was saved by the Lord in the womb of his mother. The devotees of the Lord are never in danger, but in the material world which is full of dangers at every step, the devotees are apparently placed into dangerous positions, and when they are saved by the Lord, the Lord is glorified. Lord Kṛṣṇa would not have been glorified as the speaker of the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> had His devotees like the Pāṇḍavas not been entangled in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. All such acts of the Lord were mentioned in the addresses of welcome, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit, in full satisfaction, rewarded those who presented such addresses. The difference between the presentation of welcome addresses today and in those days is that formerly the welcome addresses were presented to a person like Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The welcome addresses were full of facts and figures, and those who presented such addresses were sufficiently rewarded, whereas in the present days the welcome addresses are presented not always with factual statements but to please the post holder, and often they are full of flattering lies. And rarely are those who present such welcome addresses rewarded by the poor receiver.</p></div>

And thus the Lord also reciprocated the feelings of the Pāṇḍavas.

Simply by appreciating the dealings of the Lord with His pure devotees, one can attain salvation. The Lord’s dealings with His devotees appear to be ordinary human dealings, but one who knows them in truth becomes at once eligible to go back home, back to Godhead. The Pāṇḍavas were so malleable to the will of the Lord that they could sacrifice any amount of energy for the service of the Lord, and by such unalloyed determination they could secure the Lord’s mercy in any shape they desired.</p></div>

The human society, therefore, maintains these two important animals very carefully so that they can wander everywhere in cheerfulness. But at the present moment in this Age of Kali both the bull and the cow are now being slaughtered and eaten up as foodstuff by a class of men who do not know the brahminical culture. The bull and the cow can be protected for the good of all human society simply by the spreading of brahminical culture as the topmost perfection of all cultural affairs.

        <div id="bb16974" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>With the progress of the Age of Kali, four things particularly, namely the duration of life, mercy, the power of recollection, and moral or religious principles will gradually diminish. Since Dharma, or the principles of religion, would be lost in the proportion of three out of four, the symbolic bull was standing on one leg only. When three fourths of the population of the whole world become irreligious, the situation is converted into hell for the animals. In the Age of Kali, godless civilizations will create so many so-called religious societies in which the Personality of Godhead will be directly or indirectly defied. And thus faithless societies of men will make the world uninhabitable for the saner section of people. There are gradations of human beings in terms of proportionate faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The first-class faithful men are the Vaiṣṇavas and the <i>brāhmaṇas, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ,</span></i> then the <i>kṣatriyas, - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริยสฺ,</span></i> then the <i>vaiśyas, - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺยสฺ,</span></i> then the <i>śūdras, - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ,</span></i> then the <i>mlecchas, - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ,</span></i> the <i>yavanas - <span style="color:#990012">ยวนสฺ</span></i> and at last the <i>caṇḍāla - <span style="color:#990012">จณฺฑาล</span> - <span style="color:#990012">จณฺฑาล</span>s. - <span style="color:#990012">จณฺฑาลสฺ.</span></i> The degradation of the human instinct begins from the <i>mlecchas,</i> and the <i>caṇḍāla</i> state of life is the last word in human degradation. All the above terms mentioned in the Vedic literatures are never meant for any particular community or birth. They are different qualifications of human beings in general. There is no question of birthright or community. One can acquire the respective qualifications by one’s own efforts, and thus the son of a Vaiṣṇava can become a <i>mleccha, - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉ,</span></i> or the son of a <i>caṇḍāla</i> can become more than a <i>brāhmaṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span></i> all in terms of their association and intimate relation with the Supreme Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16975" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The meat-eaters are generally called <i>mlecchas. - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ.</span></i> But all meat-eaters are not <i>mlecchas.</i> Those who accept meat in terms of scriptural injunctions are not <i>mlecchas, - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ,</span></i> but those who accept meat without restriction are called <i>mlecchas.</i> Beef is forbidden in the scriptures, and the bulls and cows are offered special protection by followers of the <i>Vedas. - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ.</span></i> But in this Age of Kali, people will exploit the body of the bull and the cow as they like, and thus they will invite sufferings of various types.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16976" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The people of this age will not perform any sacrifice. The <i>mleccha - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉ</span></i> population will care very little for performances of sacrifices, although performance of sacrifice is essential for persons who are materially engaged in sense enjoyment. In the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (3.14-16)performance of sacrifices is strongly recommended.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16977" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The living beings are created by the creator Brahmā, and just to maintain the created living being progressively towards the path back to Godhead, the system of performing sacrifice is also created by him. The system is that living beings live on the produce of grains and vegetables, and by eating such foodstuff they get vital power of the body in the shape of blood and semen, and from blood and semen one living being is able to create other living beings. But the production of grains, grass, etc., becomes possible by rain, and this rain is made to shower properly by performance of recommended sacrifices. Such sacrifices are directed by the rites of the <i>Vedas, - <span style="color:#990012">เวทสฺ,</span></i> namely <i>Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg - <span style="color:#990012">สาม, ยชุรฺ, ฤคฺ</span></i> and <i>Atharva. - <span style="color:#990012">อตฺหรฺว.</span></i> In the <i>Manu-smṛti - <span style="color:#990012">มนุ-สฺมฺฤติ</span></i> it is recommended that by offerings of sacrifice on the altar of the fire, the sun-god is pleased. When the sun-god is pleased, he properly collects water from the sea, and thus sufficient clouds collect on the horizon and rains fall. After sufficient rains fall, there is sufficient production of grains for men and all animals, and thus there is energy in the living being for progressive activity. The <i>mlecchas, - <span style="color:#990012">เมฺลจฺฉสฺ,</span></i> however, make plans to install slaughterhouses for killing bulls and cows along with other animals, thinking that they will prosper by increasing the number of factories and live on animal food without caring for performance of sacrifices and production of grains. But they must know that even for the animals they must produce grass and vegetables, otherwise the animals cannot live. And to produce grass for the animals, they require sufficient rains. Therefore they have to depend ultimately on the mercy of the demigods like the sun-god, Indra and Candra, and such demigods must be satisfied by performances of sacrifice.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16978" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This material world is a sort of prison house, as we have several times mentioned. The demigods are the servants of the Lord who see to the proper upkeep of the prison house. These demigods want to see that the rebel living beings, who want to survive faithlessly, are gradually turned towards the supreme power of the Lord. Therefore, the system of offering sacrifice is recommended in the scriptures.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb16979" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The materialistic men want to work hard and enjoy fruitive results for sense enjoyment. Thus they are committing many types of sins at every step of life. Those, however, who are consciously engaged in the devotional service of the Lord are transcendental to all varieties of sin and virtue. Their activities are free from the contamination of the three modes of material nature. For the devotees there is no need for performance of prescribed sacrifices because the very life of the devotee is a symbol of sacrifice. But persons who are engaged in fruitive activities for sense enjoyment must perform the prescribed sacrifices because that is the only means to get free from the reaction of all sins committed by fruitive workers. Sacrifice is the means for counteracting such accumulated sins. The demigods are pleased when such sacrifices are performed, just as prison officers are satisfied when the prisoners are turned into obedient subjects. Lord Caitanya, however, has recommended only one <i>yajña, - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญ,</span></i> or sacrifice, called the <i>saṅkīrtana-yajña, - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน-ยชฺญ,</span></i> the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, in which everyone can take part. Thus both devotees and fruitive workers can derive equal benefit from the performances of <i>saṅkīrtana-yajña. - <span style="color:#990012">สงฺกีรฺตน-ยชฺญ.</span></i></p></div>

In this age illicit connection with women will render many women and children uncared for. Circumstantially, the women will try to become independent of the protection of men, and marriage will be performed as a matter of formal agreement between man and woman. In most cases, the children will not be taken care of properly. The <i>brāhmaṇas</i> are traditionally intelligent men, and thus they will be able to pick up modern education to the topmost rank, but as far as moral and religious principles are concerned, they shall be the most fallen. Education and bad character go ill together, but such things will run parallel. The administrative heads as a class will condemn the tenets of Vedic wisdom and will prefer to conduct a so-called secular state, and the so-called educated <i>brāhmaṇas</i> will be purchased by such unscrupulous administrators. Even a philosopher and writer of many books on religious principles may also accept an exalted post in a government which denies all the moral codes of the <i>śāstras. - <span style="color:#990012">ศาสฺตฺรสฺ.</span></i> The <i>brāhmaṇas</i> are specifically restricted from accepting such service. But in this age they will not only accept service, but they will do so even if it is of the meanest quality.

        <div id="bb16989" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are some necessities of life on a par with those of the lower animals, and they are eating, sleeping, fearing and mating. These bodily demands are for both the human beings and the animals. But the human being has to fulfill such desires not like animals, but like a human being. A dog can mate with a bitch before the public eyes without hesitation, but if a human being does so the act will be considered a public nuisance, and the person will be criminally prosecuted. Therefore for the human being there are some rules and regulations, even for fulfilling common demands. The human society avoids such rules and regulations when it is bewildered by the influence of the Age of Kali. In this age, people are indulging in such necessities of life without following the rules and regulations, and this deterioration of social and moral rules is certainly lamentable because of the harmful effects of such beastly behavior. In this age, the fathers and the guardians are not happy with the behavior of their wards. They should know that so many innocent children are victims of bad association awarded by the influence of this Age of Kali. We know from <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ</span></i> that Ajāmila, an innocent son of a <i>brāhmaṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span></i> was walking down a road and saw a <i>śūdra - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร</span></i> pair sexually embracing. This attracted the boy, and later on the boy became a victim of all debaucheries. From a pure <i>brāhmaṇa,</i> he fell down to the position of a wretched urchin, and it was all due to bad association. There was but one victim like Ajāmila in those days, but in this Age of Kali the poor innocent students are daily victims of cinemas which attract men only for sex indulgence. The so-called administrators are all untrained in the affairs of a <i>kṣatriya. - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย.</span></i> The <i>kṣatriyas - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริยสฺ</span></i> are meant for administration, as the <i>brāhmaṇas - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณสฺ</span></i> are meant for knowledge and guidance. The word <i>kṣatra-bandhu - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺร-พนฺธุ</span></i> refers to the so-called administrators or persons promoted to the post of the administrator without proper training by culture and tradition. Nowadays they are promoted to such exalted posts by the votes of the people who are themselves fallen in the rules and regulations of life. How can such people select a proper man when they are themselves fallen in the standard of life? Therefore, by the influence of the Age of Kali, everywhere, politically, socially or religiously, everything is topsy-turvy, and therefore for the sane man it is all regrettable.</p></div>

Such principles work fully in the age of Satya-yuga; in the Tretā-yuga they are reduced by a fraction of one fourth; in the Dvāpara-yuga they are reduced to one half, and in the Kali-yuga they are reduced to one fourth, gradually diminishing to the zero point, and then devastation takes place. Happiness in the world depends proportionately on the maintenance of the religious principles, individually or collectively. The best part of valor is to maintain the principles despite all kinds of odds. Thus one can be happy during the span of life and ultimately return to Godhead.</p></div>

        <div id="bb17013" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Even if it were possible to count the atoms after smashing the earth into powder, still it would not be possible to estimate the unfathomable transcendental qualities of the Lord. It is said that Lord Anantadeva has tried to expound the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Lord with His numberless tongues, and that for numberless years together it has been impossible to estimate the qualities of the Lord. The above statement of the qualities of the Lord is just to estimate His qualities as far as a human being is able to see Him. But even if it is so, the above qualities can be divided into many subheadings. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, the third quality, intolerance of another’s unhappiness, can be subdivided into (1) protection of the surrendered souls and (2) well wishes for the devotees. In the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> the Lord states that He wants every soul to surrender unto Him only, and He assures everyone that if one does so He will give protection from the reactions of all sins. Unsurrendered souls are not devotees of the Lord, and thus there is no particular protection for everyone in general. For the devotees He has all good wishes, and for those who are actually engaged in loving transcendental service of the Lord, He gives particular attention. He gives direction to such pure devotees to help them discharge their responsibilities on the path back to Godhead. By equality (10), the Lord is equally kind to everyone, as the sun is equal in distributing its rays over everyone. Yet there are many who are unable to take advantage of the sun’s rays. Similarly, the Lord says that surrendering unto Him is the guarantee for all protection from Him, but unfortunate persons are unable to accept this proposition, and therefore they suffer from all material miseries. So even though the Lord is equally well-wishing to everyone, the unfortunate living being, due to bad association only, is unable to accept His instructions <i>in toto, - <span style="color:#990012">อินฺ โตโต,</span></i> and for this the Lord is never to be blamed. He is called the well-wisher for the devotees only. He appears to be partial to His devotees, but factually the matter rests on the living being to accept or reject equal treatment by the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb17014" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord never deviates from His word of honor. When He gives assurance for protection, the promise is executed in all circumstances. It is the duty of the pure devotee to be fixed in the discharge of the duty entrusted to him by the Lord or the Lord’s bona fide representative, the spiritual master. The rest is carried on by the Lord without a break.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb17015" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The responsibility of the Lord is also unique. The Lord has no responsibility because all His work is done by His different appointed energies. But still He accepts voluntary responsibilities in displaying different roles in His transcendental pastimes. As a boy, He was playing the part of a cowboy. As the son of Nanda Mahārāja, He discharged responsibility perfectly. Similarly, when He was playing the part of a <i>kṣatriya - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span> - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span></i> as the son of Mahārāja Vasudeva, He displayed all the skill of a martially spirited <i>kṣatriya. - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย.</span></i> In almost all cases, the <i>kṣatriya</i> king has to secure a wife by fighting or kidnapping. This sort of behavior for a <i>kṣatriya</i> is praiseworthy in the sense that a <i>kṣatriya</i> must show his power of chivalry to his would-be wife so that the daughter of a <i>kṣatriya</i> can see the valor of her would-be husband. Even the Personality of Godhead Śrī Rāma displayed such a spirit of chivalry during His marriage. He broke the strongest bow, called Haradhanur, and achieved the hand of Sītādevī, the mother of all opulence. The <i>kṣatriya</i> spirit is displayed during marriage festivals, and there is nothing wrong in such fighting. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa discharged such responsibility fully because although He had more than sixteen thousand wives, in each and every case He fought like a chivalrous <i>kṣatriya</i> and thus secured a wife. To fight sixteen thousand times to secure sixteen thousand wives is certainly possible only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, He displayed full responsibility in every action of His different transcendental pastimes.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb17016" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The fourteenth quality, knowledge, can be further extended into five subheadings, namely (1) intelligence, (2) gratefulness, (3) power of understanding the circumstantial environments of place, object and time, (4) perfect knowledge of everything, and (5) knowledge of the self. Only fools are ungrateful to their benefactors. The Lord, however, does not require benefit from anyone besides Himself because He is full in Himself; still He feels benefited by the unalloyed services of His devotees. The Lord feels grateful to His devotees for such unsophisticated, unconditional service and tries to reciprocate it by rendering service, although the devotee also has no such desire in his heart. The transcendental service of the Lord is itself a transcendental benefit for the devotee, and therefore the devotee has nothing to expect from the Lord. On the assertion of the Vedic aphorism <i>sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma, - <span style="color:#990012">สรฺวํ ขลฺวฺ อิทํ พฺรหฺม,</span></i> we can understand that the Lord, by the omnipresent rays of His effulgence, called <i>brahmajyoti, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺมโชฺยติ,</span></i> is all-pervading inside or outside of everything, like the omnipresent material sky, and thus He is also omniscient.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb17017" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>As far as the beauty of the Lord is concerned, He has some special features that distinguish Him from all other living beings, and over and above that He has some special attractive beautiful features by which He attracts the mind of even Rādhārāṇī, the supermost beautiful creation of the Lord. He is known, therefore, as Madana-mohana, or one who attracts the mind of even Cupid. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhu has scrutinizingly analyzed other transcendental qualities of the Lord and affirms that Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead (Parabrahman). He is omnipotent by His inconceivable energies, and therefore He is the Yogeśvara, or the supreme master of all mystic powers. Being the Yogeśvara, His eternal form is spiritual, a combination of eternity, bliss and knowledge. The nondevotee class cannot understand the dynamic nature of His knowledge because they are satisfied to reach up to His eternal form of knowledge. All great souls aspire to be equal in knowledge with Him. This means that all other knowledge is ever insufficient, flexible and measurable, whereas the knowledge of the Lord is ever fixed and unfathomable. Śrīla Sūta Gosvāmī affirms in the <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> that although He was observed by the citizens of Dvārakā every day, they were ever increasingly anxious to see Him again and again. The living beings can appreciate the qualities of the Lord as the ultimate goal, but they cannot attain the status quo of such equality. This material world is a product of the <i>mahat-tattva, - <span style="color:#990012">มหตฺ-ตตฺตฺว,</span></i> which is a state of the Lord’s dreaming condition in His <i>yoga-nidrā - <span style="color:#990012">โยค-นิทฺรา</span></i> mystic slumber in the Causal Ocean, and yet the whole creation appears to be a factual presentation of His creation. This means that the Lord’s dreaming conditions are also factual manifestations. He can therefore bring everything under His transcendental control, and thus whenever and wherever He does appear, He does so in His fullness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb17018" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The Lord, being all that is described above, maintains the affairs of the creation, and by His so doing He gives salvation even to His enemies who are killed by Him. He is attractive even to the topmost liberated soul, and thus He is worshipable even by Brahmā and Śiva, the greatest of all demigods. Even in His incarnation of <i>puruṣa-avatāra - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ-อวตาร</span></i> He is the Lord of the creative energy. The creative material energy is working under His direction, as confirmed in the <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> (9.10). He is the control switch of the material energy, and to control the material energy in the innumerable universes, He is the root cause of innumerable incarnations in all the universes. There are more than five hundred thousand incarnations of Manu in only one universe, besides other incarnations in different universes. In the spiritual world, however, beyond the <i>mahat-tattva, - <span style="color:#990012">มหตฺ-ตตฺตฺว,</span></i> there is no question of incarnations, but there are plenary expansions of the Lord in different Vaikuṇṭhas. The planets in the spiritual sky are at least three times the number of those within the innumerable universes in the <i>mahat-tattva. - <span style="color:#990012">มหตฺ-ตตฺตฺว.</span></i> And all the Nārāyaṇa forms of the Lord are but expansions of His Vāsudeva feature, and thus He is Vāsudeva, Nārāyaṇa and Kṛṣṇa simultaneously. He is <i>śrī-kṛṣṇa govinda hare murāre he nātha nārāyaṇa vāsudeva, - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรี-กฺฤษฺณ โควินฺท หเร มุราเร เห นาตฺห นารายณ วาสุเทว,</span></i> all in one. His qualities, therefore, cannot be counted by anyone, however great one may be.</p></div>

When the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth, the impressions of the special signs of His lotus feet were stamped on the dust, and as a result of this specific grace, the whole earth was made as perfect as possible. In other words, the rivers, the seas, the forests, the hills and the mines, which are the supplying agents for the necessities of men and animals, were fully discharging their respective duties. Therefore the riches of the world surpassed all the riches of all other planets in the three planetary systems of the universe. One should, therefore, ask that the grace of the Lord always be present on earth so that we may be favored with His causeless mercy and be happy, having all necessities of life. One may ask how we can detain the Supreme Lord on this earth after His mission is fulfilled and He has left this earth for His own abode. The answer is that there is no need to detain the Lord. The Lord, being omnipresent, can be present with us if we want Him at all. By His omnipresence, He can always be with us if we are attached to His devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, etc.</p></div>

The only thing we must learn is to excavate the source of connection and thus be linked with Him by offenseless service. We can be connected with Him by the transcendental sound representation of the Lord. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself are identical, and one who chants the holy name of the Lord in an offenseless manner can at once realize that the Lord is present before him. Even by the vibration of radio sound, we can partially realize sound relativity, and by resounding the sound of transcendence we can verily feel the presence of the Lord. In this age, when everything is polluted by the contamination of Kali, it is instructed in the scriptures and preached by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that by chanting the holy name of the Lord, we can at once be free from contamination and gradually rise to the status of transcendence and go back to Godhead. The offenseless chanter of the holy name of the Lord is as auspicious as the Lord Himself, and the movement of pure devotees of the Lord all over the world can at once change the troublesome face of the world. Only by the propagation of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord can we be immune from all effects of the Age of Kali.</p></div>
