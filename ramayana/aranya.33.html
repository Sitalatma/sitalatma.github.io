<td width="68%">
<p class="txt">Shūrpanakha taunts Ravana for his un-kingly activities, by which his kingdom is going to face a calamitous situation soon. While
gibing at him she narrates how a king, really fit for kingship, shall conduct the affairs of kingdom. She speaks many paradigms on which many
commentaries are declined basing on kings and their vices.</p>
<p class="tat">
This chapter vies with the 33rd chapter of Kishkindha Kanda in the attitudes of a king and his kingship. These two chapters, as
detailed by ancient commentators, equally deal with <strong>rāja nīti shastra</strong> 'political science' and there in Kishkindha the only rescue
to Sugreeva is Tara, who saves the face of Sugreeva before Lakshmana, whereas in here Ravana has none to come to his aid when chided by Shūrpanakha.
Though Shūrpanakha is a sultry and harpy demoness, the Sage Valmiki has put some rational words on her tongue in forewarning Ravana.</p>

a king weak in body, mind, and time. The timely actions he is supposed to take do not come to mind because 
mind is weakened and benumbed. Then he is liable to believe his aids that may precisely land him into 
further troubles. Hence a king / ruler has to take actions and decisions personally, on time, duly remaining 
firm by his body and mind.</p>
