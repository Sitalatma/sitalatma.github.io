<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 111<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">ṃandodari stares at the dead body of Ravana and laments, recollecting the strength and power of Ravana. But, she realizes that Rama,
who killed Ravana, is none other than Vishnu the lord of maintenance of the world. She further laments that Ravana has done a sinful deed in
abducting Seetha and that he has faced the consequence in the form of his death; in the hands of Rama. She describes the charming personality and the
unconquerable prowess of Ravana, but expresses her surprise how he has been killed by a mortal like Rama. ṃandodari's co-wives console her.
ṃeanwhile, Rama asks Vibhishana to perform obsequies to Ravana. Initially, Vibhishana refuses to perform the last rites, but when Rama convinces him,
he begins to perform the funeral of Ravana. After the funeral is over, Vibhishana comes and joins Rama, who along with Lakshmana, Sugreeva and others
experience happiness for having destroyed their enemy.</p>
