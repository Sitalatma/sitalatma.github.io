Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">As ordered by Ravana, the demons wrap up old rags around Hanuma&#39;s tail, pour oil to it 
and burn it with fire. The demons tie Hanuma with ropes and conduct ihm to walk down the entire city, 
proclaining to the citizens of Lanka saying that Hanuma is a spy. The female-demons inform Seetha about 
the burning of Hanuma&#39;s tail and making him move around the city by demons. Then, Seetha starts praying 
the fire-god to do good to Hanuma. In response to her prayers, fire-god makes Hanuma feel cool with 
his burnign tail. Then, Hanuma approaches the city-gate of Lanka, takes an iron-rod from the arched 
door of the gate and kills all the security-guards there.</p>
