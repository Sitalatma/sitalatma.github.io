<p class="comment">In 'The Ancient Geography of India' K. Basu records: 'the reader should notice here that Valmiki makes mention of a few places
only, most of which are mountains in the west and ends with the poetic land of the setting Sun. This shows that little was known at that time of the
famed nations of the west, in spite of the great antiquity claimed by Egypt, Assyria, and Greece and one might be led to the thinking that these
nations had not yet risen to power in the time of Valmiki, or if they existed at all, communication was not yet opened between them and the Indian
Aryans...'</p>
<p class="comment">The words <em>a+bhāskaram, a + maryādam</em> are also taken in the sense, 'without, enlightenment; without, proper conduct, i.e.,
propriety...' 'Those places are with primitives who are unenlightened and with impropriety, that are incongruous with Ancient Indian principle of
living...' Thus, these cultures west to Persia are held as pre-Babylonian or pre-Assyrian cultures. ṃoreover, it is assumed that Sugreeva has said
this way: 'because Ravana is a highly educated and cultured demon, in his own way, he too despises those lowly cultures despite of his obstinacy. For
sure, he will not be there with Seetha, and hence Seetha need not be searched in those countries.'</p>
