gives a vivid picture of the southern side of Jambu dvīpa up to the south-most part of passable regions, next to which the abode of Yama, the
Terminator is there. This troop is also given one month's time to find the whereabouts of Seetha.</p>

and then the greatly auspicious River Varada which is an adoration to great snakes. And the territories of ṃekhala, Utkala, the cities of Dashārna,
kingdoms of Abravanti, Avanti, and Vidarbha, also thus the charming kingdom of ṃaheehaka, are to be searched thoroughly. [4-41-10]</p>
<p class="comment">If ṃahānadi is taken as a separate entity it is in Orissa, which kingdom was
called earlier as Utkala or Kalinga kingdom. Otherwise Krishnaveni becomes a 'great river' by the
adjectival wording <em>mahānadi.</em> ṃekhala territory, whose earlier name is <em>amara kanṭaka
parvata</em>, is the mountain from where the River Narmada emerges. The River Varada is now called
Wardha in ṃaharashtra. The order of rives narrated is not according to the present day mapping,
other wise ṃahānadi would have come earlier to Godavari.</p>
<p class="comment">Some mms contain <em>ashvavanti</em> 'kingdom with horses...' instead of
<em>abravanti</em> and then the age old Avanti kingdom, which is a gateway for Arabian horses will
be the famed kingdom for horses. This is the present day Ujjain in ṃadhya Pradesh. Dharmākūtam
has this as <em>abruvantīm bruvantimm</em> roughly forming part of the speech of Sugreeva 'spoken
and unspoken areas by me...' However, these areas are in the Southwest of India, and it appears the
order of positing the rivers or kingdoms, one after the other is not maintained or may be
shuffled.</p>

<p class="comment">Some other mms have ṃatsya desha in this verse instead of the Vanga desha. The
Vanga is the present day Bengal and this territory retained its epical name, but while pronouncing
it becomes <em>banga</em> because the Sanskrit grammar allows to pronounce or write <em>va</em> as
<em>ba</em> by the rule <em>va ba yoḥ abhedaḥ</em> and thus it is called Bāngla or Bengal as
British used to call. Kaushika in some other mms is read as <em>kāshika</em>. Kalinga is Orissa
which touches Bengal at its north, and it is the <em>Kie-ling-kia</em> as said by Huet Tsang.</p>
<p class="comment">The Andhra is the present day Andhra Pradesh and chola is the present Tamil
Nadu, especially northern area, and Pundra is roughly in between Andhra and chola. Pāndya is
south-most area where in Kanyakumari district the Cape Camorin is there, and Kerala is the present
Kerala state from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. Its historical name was <em>chera rājya</em> and in
Ashoka's time, it was called <em>kerala putra.</em></p>

<p class="comment">The River Kāveri is the best river in southern peninsula of India that flows
from Braham Giri ṃountains in Coorg of Western India to the East draining in Bay of Bengal and
irrigating a major chunk of land. ṃany legends are associated with this river, of which one is that
when Sage Agastya was bringing waters of River Ganga, they sprinkled from his <em>kamandulau,</em>
the handy water-vessel, and flooded like Kāveri. The original Tamil name is <em>kakaviri</em>
where <em>kākam</em> is 'crow...' <em>viri</em> 'spread out...' When Agastya is bringing water it
sprinkled from his handy vessel and flooded the <em>kā</em> 'the garden...' in Tamil, the garden
of Indra. Then it is called <em>kāviri</em>, but <em>Shilpadikkāram</em> records its name as
Kāveri only <em>pulavoy vazhi kāveri... nadanthai vazhi kāveri...</em></p>

<p class="comment">The romantic touch is that the River Tāmraparni has sandalwood trees alongshore and by constant rubbing of her waters, those
trees that yield sandalwood paste to her. And her island-like breasts are smeared with that sandal paste supplied by the trees alongshore, while she
is nearing her husband, namely the ocean.</p>
<p class="comment">The name of the river Tāmraparni or Tamiravarani or Tāmravarni derives from
the words <em>tāmra</em> 'coppery...' <em>varṇa</em> 'colour...' 'a river with coppery
riverbanks...' where those riverbanks have light coppery sandalwood trees. And she flows from
Agastyamalai in Western Ghats of India, and courses through Papanāsham, a holy place. And covering
Tirunalveli it drains into Bay of Bengal at the Gulf of ṃannār. There are hosts of
<em>vainavatiruppadigal</em> 'Vaishnavaite temples...' throughout its riverbanks and this river is
held holy. There are many legends about it, of which one says that Sage Agastya led the course of
this river to the ocean for twenty-seven days from its source.</p>
<p class="comment">Down south of the River Tāmraparni it is <em>simhala desha or senga-kia-lo</em>
the present day Sri Lanka. 'This was first made known to the European world by the expedition of
Alexander, as <em>Taprobane</em>. The true form however would appear to be <em>Ta'mba panni</em> or
the 'red-leaved one...' from the Sanskrit <em>T'amparni</em> and Ptolemy calls it <em>Salike,</em>
corrupt from <em>Simhalaka</em> Abu Rihān gives the form of <em>Singal-dip</em> and then the
Arabic name <em>Tilān</em> came and that resulted into <em>Cylone.</em> After a long lost time
they have renamed it as per the nomenclature given in Ramayana as <em>Lanka,</em> but adding a
<em>Sri</em> before it. [After Ancient Geography of India.]</p>

<p class="comment">There are three mountains in Kanyakumari district, the southern promontories of
India, at the end of Western Ghats, namely <em>Thadaka malai, ṃahendra giri, ṃarunthuva malai,</em>
where the word <em>malai, giri</em> is 'mountain...' in Tamil. The <em>Thadakamalai</em> is held as
the forest of Tataka, the demoness, and Rama is believed to have come up to this south most part of
India to eliminate Tataka in his boyhood. The <em>ṃahendragiri</em> is the mountain from which
Hanuma leaps to Lanka and the river that emerges from this mountain is named after Hanuma. The
<em>ṃarunthuvamalai</em> is believed to be a mound fallen from the main Himalayan mountain which
Hanuma brought while bringing <em>sanjīvini</em> herb, to bring Lakshmana to conscious. Even now,
the local people benefit from the herbs that grow on this mountain and even the bitter leaves when
cooked on this mountain will turn to sweet taste. This is being the story of this end of the ocean
for Herbal ṃountain, on the other end in Sri Lanka also there is a similar herbal mountain called
Rhumassala Kanda, in Singhalese.</p>

<p class="comment">A controversy is there regarding this statement of Sugreeva. Earlier Sugreeva said, "Not known is the domain of that sinning demon
at all, nor his capabilities... or valour...or even about his sinister dynasty or lineage..." [4-7-2] And now he is specifically stating that Ravana
will be on an island. Then it may be asked whether Sugreeva bluffed to Rama as at 4-7-2, for which it is said that Sugreeva being an intelligent
kingly being he did not reveal the truth as an 'official secret.' Otherwise, if Sugreeva told Rama in the first instance where Ravana is, Rama goes
straight to Lanka to eliminate Ravana, thereby Sugreeva's politics, i.e., the elimination of Vali or getting Kishkindha, will not work.</p>
<p class="comment">It is correct that Sugreeva knows that Ravana dwells in Lanka. But on abducting Seetha where is the guarantee that he is still in
Lanka along with Seetha. Hence a doubtful situation cannot be stated assertively, that too, to a friend, for it ensues 
<span class="em">mitra droha</span> 'cheating a
friend...'</p>
<p class="comment">On the other hand, it is said that Sugreeva came to know about the details of
Ravana through Tara, because Tara also explains to Lakshmana about the establishment of Ravana. But
Sugreeva as the prince regent of Kishkindha and participant in all the activities of the kingdom,
knowing about Ravana through Tara is an evasive statement. Hence, it is said that Sugreeva
purposefully did not reveal the details about Ravana to Rama, because his own interests are to be
met with firstly.</p>
<p class="comment">In turn it is asked as to why Sugreeva should send so many monkeys to all
corners of compass when the kidnapper and his location are known, for which it is said that no
thief hides his booty in his own place. Like cat changing the places of kitten, a thief too changes
his own place, as well as the place of stolen thing. To justify this, it is said that throughout
this and in the previous, and in the next chapters Sugreeva goes on repeating his order,
<em>'search for Seetha and for the residency of Ravana...'</em></p>
<p class="comment">Even here, Sugreeva is not able to describe the interior of Lanka as he is not well acquainted with it. Rama, who is astounded at
this geographical description of Sugreeva, does not ask Sugreeva as to why this particular place of Ravana is not indicated to him earlier. So, the
denial of information earlier by Sugreeva is completely political, and now giving orders to search Seetha is for his requital.</p>
