<h3>Book I : Bala Kanda - The Youthful ṃajesties</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 26<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Sept 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">
Rama encounters his first problem-female demoness Tataka, also called as Tādaka, 
and eliminates her at the orders of sage Vishvamitra. This is a crucial test put 
to Rama by Vishvamitra in ascertaining whether Rama is the follower of dharma through 
elder men&#39;s orders or not. Rama eradicates Tataka basing on his own self-confidence.</p>

Dasharatha bade Rama to do whatever assigned by Vishvamitra. Here Vishvamitra is 
assigning something ambiguous. Hence the dilemma between two instructions of two 
elderly people, and thus scriptures and practise confuse the young.</p>

<p class="comment">
Here Rama is in the same predicament as Arjuna in ṃaha Bharata. Arjuna&#39;s dilemma 
is to kill his own relatives, where Rama&#39;s is to kill a female at this juncture. 
What Krishna preaches in entire Bhagavad Gita is told in nutshell by sage Vishvamitra, 
i.e., &#39;do your duty as a Kshatriya, the ruling class, and protect virtue and eradicate 
vice, whether it is in the form of females or relatives.&#39; <em>atha vishvāmitro

Test for Rama&#39;s discipline.

<p class="comment">
The materialists view this episode as a function of Rama in eradicating natural 
calamities like dust storms, pellet storms in an uncultivable land, on the line 
of the episode of Ahalya. In this episode Rama&#39;s discipline is also tested. Whether 
he simply follows what is instructed or whether he uses his own discretion, is the 
topic here. Rama coupled both and eradicates Tataka, tough he doubts for a while 
whether to eliminate a female.

This is required for the endowment of deadly missiles 
to Rama in coming chapters. Hence Vishvamitra asks Rama to depend upon his own self-confidence 
to undertake this deed as at 1-24-30b, 31a. On satisfying with the eligibility of 
Rama to receive missiles with this episode, Vishvamitra accords those deadly weapons 
later.</p>
