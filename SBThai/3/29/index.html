        <div id="bb26559" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this Twenty-ninth Chapter, the glories of devotional service are elaborately explained, and the influence of time on the conditioned soul is also described. The purpose of elaborately describing the influence of time is to detach the conditioned soul from his material activities, which are considered to be simply a waste of time. In the previous chapter, material nature, the spirit and the Supreme Lord, or Supersoul, are analytically studied, and in this chapter the principles of <i>bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> or devotional service — the execution of activities in the eternal relationship between the living entities and the Personality of Godhead — are explained.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26560" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p><i>Bhakti-yoga, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> devotional service, is the basic principle of all systems of philosophy; all philosophy which does not aim for devotional service to the Lord is considered merely mental speculation. But of course <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> with no philosophical basis is more or less sentiment. There are two classes of men. Some consider themselves intellectually advanced and simply speculate and meditate, and others are sentimental and have no philosophical basis for their propositions. Neither of these can achieve the highest goal of life — or, if they do, it will take them many, many years. Vedic literature therefore suggests that there are three elements — namely the Supreme Lord, the living entity and their eternal relationship — and that the goal of life is to follow the principles of <i>bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ,</span></i> or devotional service, and ultimately attain to the planet of the Supreme Lord in full devotion and love as an eternal servitor of the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26561" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Sāṅkhya philosophy is the analytical study of all existence. One has to understand everything by examining its nature and characteristics. This is called acquirement of knowledge. But one should not simply acquire knowledge without reaching the goal of life or the basic principle for acquiring knowledge — <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> If we give up <i>bhakti-yoga</i> and simply busy ourselves in the analytical study of the nature of things as they are, then the result will be practically nil. It is stated in the <i>Bhāgavatam - <span style="color:#990012">ภาควตมฺ</span></i> that such engagement is something like husking a paddy. There is no use beating the husk if the grain has already been removed. By the scientific study of material nature, the living entity and the Supersoul, one has to understand the basic principle of devotional service to the Lord.</p></div>

It is the general feeling of the Vaiṣṇava, or devotee of the Lord, that he should awaken them. Similarly, Devahūti is requesting her glorious son to illuminate the lives of the conditioned souls so that their most regrettable conditional life may be ended.

They have no eyes to see their own interests. They do not know that the goal of life is not to increase the material necessities of existence, because the body will not exist more than a few years. The living beings are eternal, and they have their eternal need. If one engages only in caring for the necessities of the body, not caring for the eternal necessities of life, then he is part of a civilization whose advancement puts the living entities in the darkest region of ignorance. Sleeping in that darkest region, one does not get any refreshment, but, rather, gradually becomes fatigued. He invents many processes to adjust this fatigued condition, but he fails and thus remains confused. The only path for mitigating his fatigue in the struggle for existence is the path of devotional service, or the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>

A person in need of money approaches the Lord to ask for some improvement in his monetary condition. Others, who are not in distress or in need of monetary assistance but are seeking knowledge in order to understand the Absolute Truth, also take to devotional service, and they inquire into the nature of the Supreme Lord. This is very nicely described in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> (7.16). Actually the path of devotional service is one without a second, but according to the devotees’ condition, devotional service appears in multifarious varieties, as will be nicely explained in the following verses.</p></div>

In pure devotional service, the only motive should be to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is not actually a motive; that is the pure condition of the living entity. In the conditioned stage, when one engages in devotional service he should follow the instruction of the bona fide spiritual master in full surrender. The spiritual master is the manifested representation of the Supreme Lord because he receives and presents the instructions of the Lord, as they are, by disciplic succession. It is described in <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that the teachings therein should be received by disciplic succession, otherwise there is adulteration. To act under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master with a motive to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead is pure devotional service.

        <div id="bb26599" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word “separatist” must be understood carefully. The Sanskrit words in this connection are <i>bhinna-dṛk - <span style="color:#990012">ภินฺน-ทฺฤกฺ</span></i> and <i>pṛthag-bhāvaḥ. - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺฤตฺหคฺ-ภาวฮ.</span></i> A separatist is one who sees his interest as separate from that of the Supreme Lord. Mixed devotees, or devotees in the modes of passion and ignorance, think that the interest of the Supreme Lord is supplying the orders of the devotee; the interest of such devotees is to draw from the Lord as much as possible for their sense gratification. This is the separatist mentality. Actually, pure devotion is explained in the previous chapter: the mind of the Supreme Lord and the mind of the devotee should be dovetailed. A devotee should not wish anything but to execute the desire of the Supreme. That is oneness. When the devotee has an interest or will different from the interest of the Supreme Lord, his mentality is that of a separatist. When the so-called devotee desires material enjoyment, without reference to the interest of the Supreme Lord, or he wants to become famous or opulent by utilizing the mercy or grace of the Supreme Lord, he is in the mode of passion.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26600" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Māyāvādīs, however, interpret this word “separatist” in a different way. They say that while worshiping the Lord, one should think himself one with the Supreme Lord. This is another adulterated form of devotion within the modes of material nature. The conception that the living entity is one with the Supreme is in the mode of ignorance. Oneness is actually based on oneness of interest. A pure devotee has no interest but to act on behalf of the Supreme Lord. When one has even a tinge of personal interest, his devotion is mixed with the three modes of material nature.</p></div>

If there is any inebriety or fault, it is atoned for by this offering process. But if this offering process is in the mode of goodness rather than in pure devotion, then the interest is different. The four <i>āśramas</i> and the four <i>varṇas</i> act for some benefit in accordance with their personal interests. Therefore such activities are in the mode of goodness; they cannot be counted in the category of pure devotion.

There is hearing in the mode of passion, in the mode of ignorance and in the mode of goodness. Similarly, there is chanting in the mode of ignorance, passion and goodness, etc. Three multiplied by nine equals twenty-seven, and when again multiplied by three it becomes eighty-one. One has to transcend all such mixed materialistic devotional service in order to reach the standard of pure devotional service, as explained in the next verses.</p></div>

There is no need to practice meditation to attain such attraction; the pure devotee is already in the transcendental stage, and the affinity between him and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is natural and is compared to the Ganges water flowing towards the sea. The flow of the Ganges water cannot be stopped by any condition; similarly, a pure devotee’s attraction for the transcendental name, form and pastimes of the Supreme Godhead cannot be stopped by any material condition. The word <i>avicchinnā, - <span style="color:#990012">อวิจฺฉินฺนา,</span></i> “without interruptions,” is very important in this connection. No material condition can stop the flow of the devotional service of a pure devotee.</p></div>

This is the first symptom of unalloyed devotion. <i>Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam: - <span style="color:#990012">อนฺยาภิลาษิตา-ศูนฺยมฺ:</span></i> he has no desire to fulfill by rendering devotional service. Such devotional service is meant for the <i>puruṣottama, - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุโษตฺตม,</span></i> the Supreme Personality, and not for anyone else. Sometimes pseudodevotees show devotion to many demigods, thinking the forms of the demigods to be the same as the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s form. It is specifically mentioned herein, however, that <i>bhakti, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ,</span></i> devotional service, is meant only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead — Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa — not for anyone else.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26614" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p><i>Avyavahitā - <span style="color:#990012">อวฺยวหิตา</span></i> means “without cessation.” A pure devotee must engage in the service of the Lord twenty-four hours a day, without cessation; his life is so molded that at every minute and every second he engages in some sort of devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Another meaning of the word <i>avyavahitā - <span style="color:#990012">อวฺยวหิตา</span></i> is that the interest of the devotee and the interest of the Supreme Lord are on the same level. The devotee has no interest but to fulfill the transcendental desire of the Supreme Lord. Such spontaneous service unto the Supreme Lord is transcendental and is never contaminated by the material modes of nature. These are the symptoms of pure devotional service, which is free from all contamination of material nature.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26619" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Lord Caitanya teaches us how to execute pure devotional service out of spontaneous love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the <i>Śikṣāṣṭaka, - <span style="color:#990012">ศิกฺษาษฺฏก,</span></i> He prays to the Lord: “O Lord, I do not wish to gain from You any wealth, nor do I wish to have a beautiful wife, nor do I wish to have many followers. All I want from You is that in life after life I may remain a pure devotee at Your lotus feet.” There is a similarity between the prayers of Lord Caitanya and the statements of <i>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺรีมทฺ-ภาควตมฺ.</span></i> Lord Caitanya prays, “in life after life,” indicating that a devotee does not even desire the cessation of birth and death. The <i>yogīs - <span style="color:#990012">โยคีสฺ</span></i> and empiric philosophers desire cessation of the process of birth and death, but a devotee is satisfied even to remain in this material world and execute devotional service.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26620" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is clearly stated herein that a pure devotee does not desire <i>ekatva, - <span style="color:#990012">เอกตฺว,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">เอกตฺว,</span></i> oneness with the Supreme Lord, as desired by the impersonalists, the mental speculators and the meditators. To become one with the Supreme Lord is beyond the dream of a pure devotee. Sometimes he may accept promotion to the Vaikuṇṭha planets to serve the Lord there, but he will never accept merging into the Brahman effulgence, which he considers worse than hellish. Such <i>ekatva,</i> or merging into the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, is called <i>kaivalya - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺย</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ไกวลฺย,</span></i> but the happiness derived from <i>kaivalya</i> is considered by the pure devotee to be hellish. The devotee is so fond of rendering service to the Supreme Lord that the five kinds of liberation are not important to him. If one is engaged in pure transcendental loving service to the Lord, it is understood that he has already achieved the five kinds of liberation.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26621" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When a devotee is promoted to the spiritual world, Vaikuṇṭha, he receives four kinds of facilities. One of these is <i>sālokya, - <span style="color:#990012">สาโลกฺย,</span></i> living on the same planet as the Supreme Personality. The Supreme Person, in His different plenary expansions, lives on innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets, and the chief planet is Kṛṣṇaloka. Just as within the material universe the chief planet is the sun, in the spiritual world the chief planet is Kṛṣṇaloka. From Kṛṣṇaloka, the bodily effulgence of Lord Kṛṣṇa is distributed not only to the spiritual world but to the material world as well; it is covered by matter, however, in the material world. In the spiritual world there are innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets, and on each one the Lord is the predominating Deity. A devotee can be promoted to one such Vaikuṇṭha planet to live with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26622" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In <i>sārṣṭi - <span style="color:#990012">สารฺษฺฏิ</span></i> liberation the opulence of the devotee is equal to the opulence of the Supreme Lord. <i>Sāmīpya - <span style="color:#990012">สามีปฺย</span></i> means to be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord. In <i>sārūpya - <span style="color:#990012">สารูปฺย</span></i> liberation the bodily features of the devotee are exactly like those of the Supreme Person but for two or three symptoms found exclusively on the transcendental body of the Lord. Śrīvatsa, for example, the hair on the chest of the Lord, particularly distinguishes Him from His devotees.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26623" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A pure devotee does not accept these five kinds of spiritual existence, even if they are offered, and he certainly does not hanker after material benefits, which are all insignificant in comparison with spiritual benefits. When Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered some material benefit, he stated, “My Lord, I have seen that my father achieved all kinds of material benefits, and even the demigods were afraid of his opulence, but still, in a second, You have finished his life and all his material prosperity.” For a devotee there is no question of desiring any material or spiritual prosperity. He simply aspires to serve the Lord. That is his highest happiness.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26628" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, who is supposed to be the leader of the impersonalist school of philosophers, has admitted in the beginning of his comments on <i>Bhagavad-gītā - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา</span></i> that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is beyond the material creation; except for Him, everything is within the material creation. It is also confirmed in the Vedic literature that before the creation there was only Nārāyaṇa; neither Lord Brahmā nor Lord Śiva existed. Only Nārāyaṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa, is always in the transcendental position, beyond the influence of material creation.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26629" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The material qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance cannot affect the position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore He is called <i>nirguṇa - <span style="color:#990012">นิรฺคุณ</span></i> (free from all tinges of material qualities). Here the same fact is confirmed by Lord Kapila: one who is situated in pure devotional service is transcendentally situated, as is the Lord. Just as the Lord is unaffected by the influence of the material modes, so too are His pure devotees. One who is not affected by the three modes of material nature is called a liberated soul, or <i>brahma-bhūta - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-ภูต</span></i> soul. <i>Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā - <span style="color:#990012">พฺรหฺม-ภูตฮ ปฺรสนฺนาตฺมา</span></i> is the stage of liberation. <i>Ahaṁ brahmāsmi: - <span style="color:#990012">อหํ พฺรหฺมาสฺมิ:</span></i> “I am not this body.” This is applicable only to the person who constantly engages in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa and is thus in the transcendental stage; he is above the influence of the three modes of material nature.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26630" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is the misconception of the impersonalists that one can worship any imaginary form of the Lord, or Brahman, and at the end merge in the Brahman effulgence. Of course, to merge into the bodily effulgence (Brahman) of the Supreme Lord is also liberation, as explained in the previous verse. <i>Ekatva - <span style="color:#990012">เอกตฺว</span></i> is also liberation, but that sort of liberation is never accepted by any devotee, for qualitative oneness is immediately attained as soon as one is situated in devotional service. For a devotee, that qualitative equality, which is the result of impersonal liberation, is already attained; he does not have to try for it separately. It is clearly stated here that simply by pure devotional service one becomes qualitatively as good as the Lord Himself.</p></div>

No one should think that his prescribed duties are inferior. A <i>brāhmaṇa</i> can serve the Lord by using his intelligence, and the <i>kṣatriya - <span style="color:#990012">กฺษตฺริย</span></i> can serve the Supreme Lord by using his military arts, just as Arjuna served Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna was a warrior; he had no time to study <i>Vedānta - <span style="color:#990012">เวทานฺต</span></i> or other highly intellectual books. The damsels in Vrajadhāma were girls born of the <i>vaiśya - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺย</span></i> class, and they engaged in protecting cows and producing agriculture. Kṛṣṇa’s foster father, Nanda Mahārāja, and his associates were all <i>vaiśyas. - <span style="color:#990012">ไวศฺยสฺ.</span></i> They were not at all educated, but they could serve Kṛṣṇa by loving Him and by offering everything to Him. Similarly, there are many instances in which <i>caṇḍālas, - <span style="color:#990012">จณฺฑาลสฺ,</span></i> or those lower than <i>śūdras, - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺรสฺ,</span></i> have served Kṛṣṇa. Also, the sage Vidura was considered a <i>śūdra</i> because his mother happened to be a <i>śūdra. - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร.</span></i> There are no distinctions, for it is declared by the Lord in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> that anyone engaged specifically in devotional service is elevated to the transcendental position without a doubt. Everyone’s prescribed duty is glorious if it is performed in the devotional service of the Lord, without desire for profit. Such loving service must be performed without reason, without impediment, and spontaneously. Kṛṣṇa is lovable, and one has to serve Him in whatever capacity one can. That is pure devotional service.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26637" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Another significant phrase in this verse is <i>nātihiṁsreṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">นาติหิํเสฺรณ,</span></i> “with minimum violence or sacrifice of life.” Even if a devotee has to commit violence, it should not be done beyond what is necessary. Sometimes the question is put before us: “You ask us not to eat meat, but you are eating vegetables. Do you think that is not violence?” The answer is that eating vegetables is violence, and vegetarians are also committing violence against other living entities because vegetables also have life. Nondevotees are killing cows, goats and so many other animals for eating purposes, and a devotee, who is vegetarian, is also killing. But here, significantly, it is stated that every living entity has to live by killing another entity; that is the law of nature. <i>Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam: - <span style="color:#990012">ชีโว ชีวสฺย ชีวนมฺ:</span></i> one living entity is the life for another living entity. But for a human being, that violence should be committed only as much as necessary.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26638" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A human being is not to eat anything which is not offered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <i>Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">ยชฺญ-ศิษฺฏาศินฮ สนฺตฮ:</span></i> one becomes freed from all sinful reactions by eating foodstuffs which are offered to Yajña, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. A devotee therefore eats only <i>prasāda, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท,</span></i> or foodstuffs offered to the Supreme Lord, and Kṛṣṇa says that when a devotee offers Him foodstuffs from the vegetable kingdom, with devotion, He eats that. A devotee is to offer to Kṛṣṇa foodstuffs prepared from vegetables. If the Supreme Lord wanted foodstuffs prepared from animal food, the devotee could offer this, but He does not order to do that.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26639" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>We have to commit violence; that is a natural law. We should not, however, commit violence extravagantly, but only as much as ordered by the Lord. Arjuna engaged in the art of killing, and although killing is, of course, violence, he killed the enemy simply on Kṛṣṇa’s order. In the same way, if we commit violence as it is necessary, by the order of the Lord, that is called <i>nātihiṁsā. - <span style="color:#990012">นาติหิํสา.</span></i> We cannot avoid violence, for we are put into a conditional life in which we have to commit violence, but we should not commit more violence than necessary or than ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26644" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Temple worship is one of the duties of a devotee. It is especially recommended for neophytes, but those who are advanced should not refrain from temple worship. There is a distinction in the manner a neophyte and an advanced devotee appreciate the Lord’s presence in the temple. A neophyte considers the <i>arcā - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา</span>-vigraha - <span style="color:#990012">อรฺจา-วิคฺรห</span></i> (the statue of the Lord) to be different from the original Personality of Godhead; he considers it a representation of the Supreme Lord in the form of a Deity. But an advanced devotee accepts the Deity in the temple as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He does not see any difference between the original form of the Lord and the statue, or <i>arcā</i> form of the Lord, in the temple. This is the vision of a devotee whose devotional service is in the highest stage of <i>bhāva, - <span style="color:#990012">ภาว,</span></i> or love of Godhead, whereas a neophyte’s worship in the temple is a matter of routine duty.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26645" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Temple Deity worship is one of the functions of a devotee. He goes regularly to see the Deity nicely decorated, and with veneration and respect he touches the lotus feet of the Lord and presents offerings of worship, such as fruits, flowers and prayers. At the same time, to advance in devotional service, a devotee should see other living entities as spiritual sparks, parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is to offer respect to every entity that has a relationship with the Lord. Because every living entity originally has a relationship with the Lord as part and parcel, a devotee should try to see all living entities on the same equal level of spiritual existence. As stated in <i>Bhagavad-gītā, - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา,</span></i> a <i>paṇḍita, - <span style="color:#990012">ปณฺฑิต,</span></i> one who is learned, sees equally a very learned <i>brāhmaṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span> - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ,</span></i> a <i>śūdra, - <span style="color:#990012">ศูทฺร,</span></i> a hog, a dog and a cow. He does not see the body, which is only an outward dress. He does not see the dress of a <i>brāhmaṇa,</i> or that of a cow or of a hog. He sees the spiritual spark, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. If a devotee does not see every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, he is considered <i>prākṛta-bhakta, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรากฺฤต-ภกฺต,</span></i> a materialistic devotee. He is not completely situated on the spiritual platform; rather, he is in the lowest stage of devotion. He does, however, show all respect to the Deity.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26646" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Although a devotee sees all living entities on the level of spiritual existence, he is not interested in associating with everyone. Simply because a tiger is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord does not mean that we embrace him because of his spiritual relationship with the Supreme Lord. We must associate only with persons who have developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26647" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>We should befriend and offer special respect to persons who are developed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other living entities are undoubtedly part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, but because their consciousness is still covered and not developed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we should renounce their association. It is said by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura that even if one is a Vaiṣṇava, if he is not of good character his company should be avoided, although he may be offered the respect of a Vaiṣṇava. Anyone who accepts Viṣṇu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead is accepted as a Vaiṣṇava, but a Vaiṣṇava is expected to develop all the good qualities of the demigods.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26648" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The exact meaning of the word <i>sattvena - <span style="color:#990012">สเตฺตฺวน</span></i> is given by Śrīdhara Svāmī as being synonymous with <i>dhairyeṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">ไธเรฺยณ,</span></i> or patience. One must perform devotional service with great patience. One should not give up the execution of devotional service because one or two attempts have not been successful. One must continue. Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī also confirms that one should be very enthusiastic and execute devotional service with patience and confidence. Patience is necessary for developing the confidence that “Kṛṣṇa will certainly accept me because I am engaging in devotional service.” One has only to execute service according to the rules and regulations to insure success.</p></div>

On the other hand, many <i>ācāryas,</i> such as Rūpa Gosvāmī and Sanātana Gosvāmī, used to live beneath trees every night. Superficially it appeared that they were poverty-stricken, but from their writings we can understand that in spiritual life they were the richest personalities.</p></div>

For a devotee, there is no point in making friendships with ordinary persons; he should make friendship with other devotees so that by discussing among themselves they may elevate one another on the path of spiritual understanding.

One should be very tolerant and simple, one should accept the spiritual master, and one should control the senses. These are mentioned here and in <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> as well.

Lord Caitanya has given special stress to chanting of these holy names of the Lord as the basic principle of spiritual advancement. Another word used here is <i>ārjavena, - <span style="color:#990012">อารฺชเวน,</span></i> meaning “without diplomacy.” A devotee should not make plans out of self-interest. Of course, preachers sometimes have to make some plan to execute the mission of the Lord under proper guidance, but regarding personal self-interest, a devotee should always be without diplomacy, and he should avoid the company of persons who are not advancing in spiritual life. Another word is <i>ārya. - <span style="color:#990012">อารฺย.</span></i> Āryans are persons who are advancing in knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness as well as in material prosperity. The difference between the Āryan and non-Āryan, the <i>sura - <span style="color:#990012">สุร</span></i> and <i>asura, - <span style="color:#990012">อสุร,</span></i> is in their standards of spiritual advancement. Association with persons who are not spiritually advanced is forbidden. Lord Caitanya advised, <i>asat-saṅga-tyāga: - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ-สงฺค-ตฺยาค:</span></i> one should avoid persons who are attached to the temporary. <i>Asat - <span style="color:#990012">อสตฺ</span></i> is one who is too materially attached — who is not a devotee of the Lord or who is too attached to women or enjoyable material things. Such a person, according to Vaiṣṇava philosophy, is a persona non grata.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26664" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>A devotee should not be proud of his acquisitions. The symptoms of a devotee are meekness and humility. Although spiritually very advanced, he will always remain meek and humble, as Kavirāja Gosvāmī and all the other Vaiṣṇavas have taught us by personal example. Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught that one should be humbler than the grass on the street and more tolerant than the tree. One should not be proud or falsely puffed up. In this way one will surely advance in spiritual life.</p></div>

Since the individual soul is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, in that sense the Lord is living in every body, and, as Supersoul, the Lord is also present as a witness.

In other words, a devotee should not ignore any living entity. The devotee must know that in every living entity, however insignificant he may be, even in an ant, God is present, and therefore every living entity should be kindly treated and should not be subjected to any violence. In modern civilized society, slaughterhouses are regularly maintained and supported by a certain type of religious principle. But without knowledge of the presence of God in every living entity, any so-called advancement of human civilization, either spiritual or material, is to be understood as being in the mode of ignorance.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26690" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In this verse, two phrases — <i>bhūteṣu baddha-vairasya - <span style="color:#990012">ภูเตษุ พทฺธ-ไวรสฺย</span></i> (“inimical towards others”) and <i>dviṣataḥ para-kāye - <span style="color:#990012">ทฺวิษตฮ ปร-กาเย</span></i> (“envious of another’s body”) — are significant. One who is envious of or inimical towards others never experiences any happiness. A devotee’s vision, therefore, must be perfect. He should ignore bodily distinctions and should see only the presence of the part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord Himself in His plenary expansion as Supersoul. That is the vision of a pure devotee. The bodily expression of a particular type of living entity is always ignored by the devotee.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26691" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is expressed herein that the Lord is always eager to deliver the conditioned souls, who have been encaged within material bodies. Devotees are expected to carry the message or desire of the Lord to such conditioned souls and enlighten them with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Thus they may be elevated to transcendental, spiritual life, and the mission of their lives will be successful. Of course this is not possible for living entities who are lower than human beings, but in human society it is feasible that all living entities can be enlightened with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Even living entities who are lower than human can be raised to Kṛṣṇa consciousness by other methods. For example, Śivānanda Sena, a great devotee of Lord Caitanya, delivered a dog by feeding him <i>prasāda. - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท.</span></i> Distribution of <i>prasāda, - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท,</span></i> or remnants of foodstuffs offered to the Lord, even to the ignorant masses of people and to animals, gives such living entities the chance for elevation to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Factually it happened that the same dog, when met by Lord Caitanya at Purī, was liberated from the material condition.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26692" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is especially mentioned here that a devotee must be free from all violence (<i>jīvāhiṁsā - <span style="color:#990012">ชีวาหิํสา</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ชีวาหิํสา</span></i>). Lord Caitanya has recommended that a devotee not commit violence to any living entity. Sometimes the question is raised that since vegetables also have life and devotees take vegetable foodstuffs, isn’t that violence? Firstly, however, taking some leaves, twigs or fruit from a tree or plant does not kill the plant. Besides that, <i>jīvāhiṁsā</i> means that since every living entity has to pass through a particular type of body according to his past <i>karma, - <span style="color:#990012">กรฺม,</span></i> although every living entity is eternal he should not be disturbed in his gradual evolution. A devotee has to execute the principles of devotional service exactly as they are, and he must know that however insignificant a living entity may be, the Lord is present within him. A devotee must realize this universal presence of the Lord.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26697" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are sixty-four different prescriptions for worship of the Deity in the temple. There are many items offered to the Deity, some valuable and some less valuable. It is prescribed in <i>Bhagavad-gītā: - <span style="color:#990012">ภควทฺ-คีตา:</span></i> “If a devotee offers Me a small flower, a leaf, some water or a little fruit, I will accept it.” The real purpose is to exhibit one’s loving devotion to the Lord; the offerings themselves are secondary. If one has not developed loving devotion to the Lord and simply offers many kinds of foodstuffs, fruits and flowers without real devotion, the offering will not be accepted by the Lord. We cannot bribe the Personality of Godhead. He is so great that our bribery has no value. Nor has He any scarcity; since He is full in Himself, what can we offer Him? Everything is produced by Him. We simply offer to show our love and gratitude to the Lord.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26698" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>This gratitude and love for God is exhibited by a pure devotee, who knows that the Lord lives in every living entity. As such, temple worship necessarily includes distribution of <i>prasāda - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท.</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท.</span></i> It is not that one should create a temple in his private apartment or private room, offer something to the Lord, and then eat. Of course, that is better than simply cooking foodstuffs and eating without understanding one’s relationship with the Supreme Lord; people who act in this manner are just like animals. But the devotee who wants to elevate himself to the higher level of understanding must know that the Lord is present in every living entity, and, as stated in the previous verse, one should be compassionate to other living entities. A devotee should worship the Supreme Lord, be friendly to persons who are on the same level and be compassionate to the ignorant. One should exhibit his compassion for ignorant living entities by distributing <i>prasāda.</i> Distribution of <i>prasāda</i> to the ignorant masses of people is essential for persons who make offerings to the Personality of Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26699" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Real love and devotion is accepted by the Lord. Many valuable foodstuffs may be presented to a person, but if the person is not hungry, all such offerings are useless for him. Similarly, we may offer many valuable items to the Deity, but if we have no real sense of devotion and no real sense of the Lord’s presence everywhere, then we are lacking in devotional service; in such a state of ignorance, we cannot offer anything acceptable to the Lord.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26715" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It should not be misunderstood that because the Supersoul is dwelling within the heart of a living entity, the individual soul has become equal to Him. The equality of the Supersoul and the individual soul is misconceived by the impersonalist. Here it is distinctly mentioned that the individual soul should be recognized in relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The method of worshiping the individual soul is described here as either giving charitable gifts or behaving in a friendly manner, free from any separatist outlook. The impersonalist sometimes accepts a poor individual soul as being <i>daridra-nārāyaṇa, - <span style="color:#990012">ทริทฺร-นารายณ,</span></i> meaning that Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has become poor. This is a contradiction. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is full in all opulences. He can agree to live with a poor soul or even with an animal, but this does not make Him poor.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26716" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>There are two Sanskrit words used here, <i>māna - <span style="color:#990012">มาน</span></i> and <i>dāna - <span style="color:#990012">ทาน</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ทาน.</span></i> <i>Māna - <span style="color:#990012">มาน</span></i> indicates a superior, and <i>dāna</i> indicates one who gives charitable gifts or is compassionate towards an inferior. We cannot treat the Supreme Personality of Godhead as an inferior who is dependent on our charitable gifts. When we give charity, it is to a person who is inferior in his material or economic condition. Charity is not given to a rich man. Similarly, it is explicitly stated here that <i>māna, - <span style="color:#990012">มาน,</span></i> respect, is offered to a superior, and charity is offered to an inferior. The living entities, according to different results of fruitive activities, may become rich or poor, but the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unchangeable; He is always full in six opulences. Treating a living entity equally does not mean treating him as one would treat the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Compassion and friendliness do not necessitate falsely elevating someone to the exalted position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We should not, at the same time, misunderstand that the Supersoul situated in the heart of an animal like a hog and the Supersoul situated in the heart of a learned <i>brāhmaṇa - <span style="color:#990012">พฺราหฺมณ</span></i> are different. The Supersoul in all living entities is the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. By His omnipotency, He can live anywhere, and He can create His Vaikuṇṭha situation everywhere. That is His inconceivable potency. Therefore, when Nārāyaṇa is living in the heart of a hog, He does not become a hog-Nārāyaṇa. He is always Nārāyaṇa and is unaffected by the body of the hog.</p></div>

        <div id="bb26721" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>In the previous verse it was explained that living entities should be honored by charitable gifts and friendly behavior, and in this verse and in the following verses the description of different grades of living entities is given so that one can know when to behave friendly and when to give charity. For example, a tiger is a living entity, part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the Supreme Lord is living in the heart of the tiger as Supersoul. But does this mean that we have to treat the tiger in a friendly manner? Certainly not. We have to treat him differently, giving him charity in the form of <i>prasāda - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท</span>. - <span style="color:#990012">ปฺรสาท.</span></i> The many saintly persons in the jungles do not treat the tigers in a friendly way, but they supply <i>prasāda</i> foodstuffs to them. The tigers come, take the food and go away, just as a dog does. According to the Vedic system, a dog is not allowed to enter the house. Because of their uncleanliness, cats and dogs are not allowed within the apartment of a gentleman, but are so trained that they stand outside. The compassionate householder will supply <i>prasāda</i> to the dogs and cats, who eat outside and then go away. We must treat the lower living entities compassionately, but this does not mean that we have to treat them in the same way we treat other human beings. The feeling of equality must be there, but the treatment should be discriminating. Just how discrimination should be maintained is given in the following six verses concerning the different grades of living conditions.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26722" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The first division is made between dead, stonelike matter and the living organism. A living organism is sometimes manifested even in stone. Experience shows that some hills and mountains grow. This is due to the presence of the soul within that stone. Above that, the next manifestation of the living condition is development of consciousness, and the next manifestation is the development of sense perception. In the <i>Mokṣa-dharma - <span style="color:#990012">โมกฺษ-ธรฺม</span></i> section of the <i>Mahābhārata - <span style="color:#990012">มหาภารต</span></i> it is stated that trees have developed sense perception; they can see and smell. We know by experience that trees can see. Sometimes in its growth a large tree changes its course of development to avoid some hindrances. This means that a tree can see, and according to <i>Mahābhārata, - <span style="color:#990012">มหาภารต,</span></i> a tree can also smell.

One may have a very nice tongue that can vibrate sound like the frogs, but that kind of vibration is simply calling death. The best use of the tongue and of sound vibration is to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

For example, Lord Caitanya, in the role of a devotee, also preached the same philosophy. He preached that Kṛṣṇa is the worshipful Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that the interest of His pure devotees is the same as His own.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26750" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Sometimes Māyāvādī philosophers, due to a poor fund of knowledge, define the word <i>sama-darśanāt - <span style="color:#990012">สม-ทรฺศนาตฺ</span></i> to mean that a devotee should see himself as one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is foolishness. When one thinks himself one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no question of serving Him. When there is service, there must be a master. Three things must be present for there to be service: the master, the servant and the service. Here it is clearly stated that he who has dedicated his life, all his activities, his mind and his soul — everything — for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, is considered to be the greatest person.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26751" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>The word <i>akartuḥ - <span style="color:#990012">อกรฺตุฮ</span></i> means “without any sense of proprietorship.” Everyone wants to act as the proprietor of his actions so that he can enjoy the result. A devotee, however, has no such desire; he acts because the Personality of Godhead wants him to act in a particular way. He has no personal motive. When Lord Caitanya preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it was not with the purpose that people would call Him Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; rather, He preached that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and should be worshiped as such. A devotee who is a most confidential servant of the Lord never does anything for his personal account, but does everything for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. Therefore it is clearly stated, <i>mayi sannyasta-karmaṇaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">มยิ สนฺนฺยสฺต-กรฺมณฮ:</span></i> the devotee works, but he works for the Supreme. It is also stated, <i>mayy arpitātmanaḥ: - <span style="color:#990012">มยฺยฺ อรฺปิตาตฺมนฮ:</span></i> “He gives his mind unto Me.” These are the qualifications of a devotee, who, according to this verse, is accepted as the highest of all human beings.</p></div>

Similarly, that the Supreme Lord has entered into each of the 8,400,000 particular types of material bodies does not mean that each of these bodies has become the Supreme Lord. Because the Supreme Lord is present, however, a pure devotee accepts each body as the temple of the Lord, and since the devotee offers respect to such temples in full knowledge, he gives respect to every living entity in relationship with the Lord.

        <div id="bb26761" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>Herein the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kapiladeva perfectly explains that the mystic <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> system, consisting of eight different kinds of <i>yoga</i> activities, has to be performed with the aim of coming to the perfectional stage of <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> It is not acceptable for one to be satisfied simply by practicing the sitting postures and thinking himself complete. By meditation one must attain the stage of devotional service. As previously described, a <i>yogī - <span style="color:#990012">โยคี</span></i> is advised to meditate on the form of Lord Viṣṇu from point to point, from the ankles to the legs to the knees to the thighs to the chest to the neck, and in this way gradually up to the face and then to the ornaments. There is no question of impersonal meditation.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26762" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>When, by meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead in all detail, one comes to the point of love of God, that is the point of <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span>, - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค,</span></i> and at that point he must actually render service to the Lord out of transcendental love. Anyone who practices <i>yoga</i> and comes to the point of devotional service can attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental abode. Here it is clearly stated, <i>puruṣa - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ</span>ḥ puruṣaṁ vrajet: - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษฮ ปุรุษํ วฺรเชตฺ:</span></i> the <i>puruṣa, - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ,</span></i> the living entity, goes to the Supreme Person. The Supreme Personality of Godhead and the living entity are qualitatively one; both are defined as <i>puruṣa. - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ.</span></i> The quality of <i>puruṣa</i> exists both in the Supreme Godhead and in the living entity. <i>Puruṣa - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษ</span></i> means “enjoyer,” and the spirit of enjoyment is present both in the living entity and in the Supreme Lord. The difference is that the quantity of enjoyment is not equal. The living entity cannot experience the same quantity of enjoyment as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. An analogy may be made with a rich man and a poor man: the propensity for enjoyment is present in both, but the poor man cannot enjoy in the same quantity as the rich man. When the poor man dovetails his desires with those of the rich man, however, and when there is cooperation between the poor man and the rich man, or between the big and the small man, then the enjoyment is shared equally. That is like <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i> <i>Puruṣaḥ puruṣaṁ vrajet: - <span style="color:#990012">ปุรุษฮ ปุรุษํ วฺรเชตฺ:</span></i> when the living entity enters into the kingdom of God and cooperates with the Supreme Lord by giving Him enjoyment, he enjoys the same facility or the same amount of pleasure as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.</p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26763" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>On the other hand, when the living entity wants to enjoy by imitating the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his desire is called <i>māyā, - <span style="color:#990012">มายา,</span></i> and it puts him in the material atmosphere. A living entity who wants to enjoy on his personal account and not cooperate with the Supreme Lord is engaged in materialistic life. As soon as he dovetails his enjoyment with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is engaged in spiritual life. An example may be cited here: The different limbs of the body cannot enjoy life independently; they must cooperate with the whole body and supply food to the stomach. In so doing, all the different parts of the body enjoy equally in cooperation with the whole body. That is the philosophy of <i>acintya-bhedābheda, - <span style="color:#990012">อจินฺตฺย-เภทาเภท,</span></i> simultaneous oneness and difference. The living entity cannot enjoy life in opposition to the Supreme Lord; he has to dovetail his activities with the Lord by practicing <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i></p></div>
    

        <div id="bb26764" class="r r-lang-en r-paragraph" ><p>It is said herein that one can approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead by either the <i>yoga - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">โยค</span></i> process or the <i>bhakti-yoga - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span> - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค</span></i> process. This indicates that factually there is no difference between <i>yoga</i> and <i>bhakti-yoga</i> because the target of both is Viṣṇu. In the modern age, however, a <i>yoga</i> process has been manufactured which aims at something void and impersonal. Actually, <i>yoga</i> means meditation on the form of Lord Viṣṇu. If the <i>yoga</i> practice is actually performed according to the standard direction, there is no difference between <i>yoga</i> and <i>bhakti-yoga. - <span style="color:#990012">ภกฺติ-โยค.</span></i></p></div>

Similarly, everything is changed and transformed by the time factor, or by the indirect control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Actually, this forgetfulness of his relationship with Lord Viṣṇu is the cause of his destruction. Anyone who revives his consciousness of the original relationship receives inspiration from the Lord. This does not mean that the Lord is someone’s enemy and someone else’s friend.

It is therefore said, <i>hariṁ vinā na mṛtiṁ taranti: - <span style="color:#990012">หริํ วินา น มฺฤติํ ตรนฺติ:</span></i> no one can be saved from the repetition of birth and death without the help of the Supreme Lord.

The word <i>śvasatām - <span style="color:#990012">ศฺวสตามฺ</span></i> means “those who breathe,” or the living entities. In order to accommodate them, there are innumerable planets. Every planet is a residence for innumerable living entities, and the necessary space is provided in the sky by the supreme order of the Lord. It is also stated here that the total universal body is increasing. It is covered by seven layers, and as there are five elements within the universe, so the total elements, in layers, cover the outside of the universal body. The first layer is of earth, and it is ten times greater in size than the space within the universe; the second layer is water, and that is ten times greater than the earthly layer; the third covering is fire, which is ten times greater than the water covering. In this way each layer is ten times greater than the previous one.</p></div>
