sub=Intense Desire

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How do we develop an intense desire to do <em>saṅkīrtana?</em>

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You just have to meditate on it. Sometimes people think that mystic <em>yoga</em> is full of meditation and Kṛṣṇa consciousness is devoid of meditation, but that is not true. We do a lot of meditation. The difference is what we meditate on. We meditate on the spiritual master. For example, we meditate on how Śrīla Prabhupāda wrote these books with great difficulty and published the first books with great austerity, how he built up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement based on these books, how he encouraged everyone to distribute books, and how he said that our entire disciplic succession is happy when we distribute these books.

The spiritual masters in ISKCON are all followers of Śrīla Prabhupāda, and they all have an intense desire to please Śrīla Prabhupāda by distributing as many books as possible. Therefore by distributing books, we meditate on pleasing our spiritual master: "Through the mercy of my spiritual master, I can attain the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. When I please my spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa is pleased. When Kṛṣṇa is pleased, I become recognized by Him. When I become recognized by Kṛṣṇa, that's the perfection of life and there is nothing more to attain.” We should meditate just as any <em>yogi</em> in yogic practice would, fixing our minds on pleasing the spiritual master with one-pointed concentration.

The temple can be upside down, but we still concentrate on our services. Temple activities are diverse; there is cooking, cleaning, Deity worship, and distribution programs. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> devotees know that hanging around the temple may divert their meditation from their service, so they like to travel in vans. In the van, sitting on a pile of books, there is nothing else but book distribution to meditate on. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is the factor that can elevate the <em>prākṛta-bhakta</em> to the higher stages of devotional service?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> <em>Prākṛta-bhaktas</em> can be elevated immediately by taking up the preaching mission. I prefer not to initiate anyone who has not done <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, preaching, or production of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. I personally feel that if you haven't done these things, you cannot feel mercy toward other living beings. You grow up crooked and twisted, thinking that life is meant for getting nice food to eat and a nice place to live.

You can develop the proper, higher consciousness by being put into circumstances that force you to act in such a way that understanding gradually comes. You must act in higher consciousness to develop it. You may repeatedly hear how you should act, but if you refuse to act accordingly, the desire to preach will never develop, and the desire to preach distinguishes the devotees on the higher stages of devotional service from the <em>prākṛta-bhaktas</em>. When a new devotee constantly hears that one should preach and distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the desire awakens within him and slowly develops into a burning desire. This desire develops by hearing, seeing the example of others, and acting accordingly. Finally he will say, “I'm sick of sitting around in the temple all day in this <em>bhakta</em> program. Let me out of here!"

sub=The Basis of Compassion

<strong>Devotee: </strong>What is the basis of compassion?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> When you know who you are, who Kṛṣṇa is, and who the other living entities are, you will see them as members of Kṛṣṇa's spiritual family. With such transcendental knowledge, you don't just see materialists running here and there; you see fallen conditioned souls, unable to understand themselves or Kṛṣṇa because they are struggling hard with the six senses, which include the mind. Therefore, you compassionately say to them, “Stop running around and take a look at what I have for you. Read this book, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take some <em>prasādam</em>, and be happy!”.

Knowledge of Kṛṣṇa will make you compassionate. This knowledge is the key that will open the door to transcendental liberation, and you can get the key from a saintly devotee of the Lord. If you want to be compassionate, you must associate with someone who is already compassionate. Śrīla Prabhupāda was so compassionate that in his old age, when anyone else would retire, he came to America, determined to bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to all the conditioned souls. Because Prabhupāda was so compassionate, we can become compassionate by associating with him. Compassion is learned from one who has learned to be compassionate from one who has learned to be compassionate. Our disciplic succession is filled with compassion.

sub=Saṅkīrtana-phobia

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes devotees are afraid to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Even experienced <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are sometimes afraid to go out. Where does this fear come from?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Fear comes from <em>māyā</em>. <em>Māyā</em> sees that you are going to go out with Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and destroy her influence. Therefore she subtly attacks you and creates fear to stop you. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What if one lacks the patience to struggle on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and thinks it's better to stay in the temple where it's peaceful?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami</strong>: You may think that you will avoid problems by staying in the temple, but Kṛṣṇa arranges for problems to arise in the temple, so that you will realize that it is better to go on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. You will realize that although there are problems on the street, by distributing Śrīla Prabhupāda's books, the greatest welfare activity for all the people of this world, you are getting purified faster.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> But on the altar the mind seems calmer than on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> On the altar your mind might be calm to begin with, but once you have gotten used to it, the mind starts saying, “Hey, why don't you do something else? You are meant for bigger things than waving this incense.” The mind is an expert rascal. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Doesn't <em>māyā</em> attack one more out on the street?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> No. I have seen that <em>māyā</em> attacks equally everywhere, but it is good to know that on the street Kṛṣṇa offers you more protection.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> If a devotee says, “I don't like to go out because I have only bad experiences on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>," what should we do? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If someone says that he doesn't like <em>saṅkīrtana</em> because he has only bad experiences, then <em>māyā</em> has already succeeded in capturing him. You should preach to him, saying, “No matter what you do in this world, you will have bad experiences because of your <em>karma</em>. Bad experiences on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> are also because of your <em>karma</em> and not because of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. <em>Saṅkīrtana</em> will bring you blissful experiences. Sometimes it seems bad, but when you see 'good' and 'bad' in your service, whatever your service may be, you are still on the material platform. You have to transcend the material platform and come to the spiritual platform, because on the spiritual platform, one sees the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, in whatever form, as wonderful."

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Why does it seem so difficult in recent years to get new devotees for book distribution?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It is difficult because people are degrading. Most people are <em>śūdras</em> who think that anyone can distribute books. However, it has been proven throughout the years that only the highest class of men can distribute books. Although <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees may not be the most technically advanced or the greatest scholars, they know much more philosophy, and temple devotees may get involved in a scandal, but book distributors are rarely touched by scandals because they are always preaching. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some people avoid <em>saṅkīrtana</em> by saying that everything is <em>saṅkīrtana</em>.

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Śrīla Prabhupāda didn't say that everything is <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. He is not a Māyāvādi. He made a distinction between two forms of service: <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and <em>saṅkīrtana</em> support. For example, those who feed the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees are supporting, and although they are a part of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, they are not doing the same service as the front line preachers. Although everyone is appreciated, we make distinctions: the front-line warriors risking their lives in battle get medals, and behind-the-line supporters get a pat on the back.

sub=Capacity

<strong>Devotee:</strong> We can understand that we are not distributing these books, but Kṛṣṇa is. Is there…?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Is it His fault when you don't do so well one day?

<strong>Devotee:</strong> No.

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Then it's not just Kṛṣṇa distributing these books. If Kṛṣṇa were distributing these books, then what would He need you for? Do you think He needs you? Kṛṣṇa doesn't need you. By His mercy, He is allowing you to be His agent and distribute the books.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Why do some people distribute more books than others?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> They distribute more because they are better agents. When you understand the basis, the question is easy to answer. But if you speculate that Kṛṣṇa is distributing the books, then it doesn't make sense. How could Kṛṣṇa distribute sometimes more and sometimes fewer books? He would always do the same amount. But that is absurd. Some people are simply better agents than others, and those who are better agents distribute more books.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> One book distributor might do two hundred books a week and another five hundred. If both are giving everything to Kṛṣṇa, they are giving equally, but their capacities are different. What does "capacity” consist of? Is it material or spiritual? We know that Kṛṣṇa gives according to our desires. How does this apply to our specific capacities to preach? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Our capacity to work for Kṛṣṇa depends on both spiritual and material qualities. Someone materially qualified has a greater capacity to work. Yet someone else who is not materially qualified but more spiritually qualified may be able to do more than the materially adept but spiritually bankrupt person.

Take cooking, for example. A spiritually advanced person who has no interest in eating should not be able to cook a good tasting preparation based on material calculations, the material qualification being the desire to eat, because he has no relationship with the end product. As Śrīla Prabhupāda put it, “He who likes to eat can cook.” Thus both material and spiritual qualifications work together simultaneously to mold the devotee. In other words, capacity means a composite of spiritual and material qualifications. A book distributor materially qualified to communicate with people would have a better chance of distributing books well than one who is aloof.

The perfect example is Kṛṣṇa's choosing Arjuna to fight the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa did not use a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> or <em>śūdra</em> to do the work. He used a first-class <em>kṣatriya</em> warrior. Yet the material qualification was tempered by the spiritual qualification of full surrender. Kṛṣṇa could have also used Karṇa, for example, but He did not, because Karṇa was not a devotee of the Lord. Kṛṣṇa will use the surrendered soul who has some capacity to work for Him in the manner He desires. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> A devotee will have a certain capacity to do his service. Is it possible for this devotee to get a bigger result, for example, in book distribution, or is he not surrendering completely right now? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> We expect from everyone whatever one can do. If you can do three hundred books a week and someone else can do seven hundred, then we expect three hundred and seven hundred respectively. Can everybody cook the same ecstatic feast? Not everyone is the same. Even if everybody were to have the same spirit, the result would still not be the same. Maybe you are surrendering fully, but someone else may be an expert in the art of controlling people. Still it is not only an art; <em>śakti</em> is needed as well. It cannot be picked up out of the air or learned at the chalk board. There are also other factors, such as austerity and previous lives. We simply expect the best you can do, and to try your best is purity. If three hundred books is as much as you can do, and seven hundred books is as much as he can do, then equal! In the example of Hanumān and the spider, Lord Rāmacandra accepted both equally, because both gave the best they had.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes devotees disagree about the example of Hanumān and the spider because their bodies were different sizes, but we have bodies that are all the same. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> All the same? If you and Harināmānanda dāsa stand next to each other, you both have human bodies but you are not the same. You both have different histories of billions of lifetimes.

sub=Saṅkīrtana Is Transcendental

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some devotees say that book distribution is brahminical and some say that it isn't. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> In one room conversation, Śrīla Prabhupāda called selling books a <em>vaiśya</em> activity. At other times he said that it is brahminical because it is teaching. It depends on how you do it. You have a <em>vaiśya</em> mentality if you say, “I am collecting for the ants in Mesopotamia,” because you are using deception to get some money and then throwing a book at him. But distributing books the way you are supposed to, by straight preaching, is brahminical. You show him the book in your hand and present it on the basis of what the book says and explain why the book is good to read. Of course, Prabhupāda said "by hook or by crook,” which implies that you can also do it with a <em>vaiśya</em> mentality. But if you are strong enough, you can sell the book on its merits by speaking philosophically to the people. Selling the books on the basis of the books is brahminical, and doing it to make money may indicate a <em>vaiśya</em> mentality, but book distribution itself is purely a Vaiṣṇava activity. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Which is better, to remain a simple book distributor one's whole life or to get brahminical initiation and a high post? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> First, it is not that you either distribute books or you get <em>brāhmaṇa</em> initiation; the book distributors are the <em>brāhmaṇas</em>, and we give them <em>brāhmaṇa</em> initiation. Second, the book distributors are in the highest position; there is no post higher than distributing books.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How is book distribution related to <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em>?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Book distribution itself has little to do with <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em>. For example, <em>brāhmaṇas</em> would never sell anything, and <em>vaiśyas</em> would never distribute Vedic literature. It cannot be classified according to any <em>varṇa</em>, but if it had to be classified, it would be brahminical (an insult, though not a big one). Book distribution is pure, transcendental activity. Everyone talks about transcending the modes of nature; nothing is more transcendental than distributing books, and everything else is questionable. By the distribution of these books, people will understand that their speculations are resulting in a chaotic society and that they need <em>varṇāśrama-dharma</em> to properly organize society.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is it required to have a <em>kṣatriya</em> spirit to have enough courage and determination to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> and do battle with <em>māyā</em>? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> First, you don't need a <em>kṣatriya</em> mood to have courage and determination; second, it is not the same kind of battle as in a war; and third, the great distributors say that the most important quality is complete dedication to the spiritual master's mission and the other qualities follow automatically. To give a gross example: a hungry person, even a young baby, knows exactly where and how to put food into the mouth. He doesn't have to think about it. Similarly, if you do <em>saṅkīrtana</em> with complete dedication to the lotus feet of your spiritual master and constantly meditate on distributing the books for his pleasure, you will automatically get the necessary determination and intelligence to present the books correctly. There will be no weakheartedness. You will dash right onto the battlefield, weapons in hand. With this dedication and daily meditation you will succeed. By praying, before the Deities or within the heart, “Please Kṛṣṇa, help me in this mission. Please, help me satisfy my spiritual master,” you will get the mercy and all good qualities will develop within you. This I have heard from great authorities.

sub=Becoming Steady

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How can we become steady on book distribution?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The goal of every devotee in the movement, whether he is distributing books or not, is to become steady in his service. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted the devotees to be steady, so that they could become experts and have good results in their services. If you are always changing your service, you will not learn anything properly. Imagine having different cooks every day. No one would ever learn how to cook <em>prasādam</em>, and you would never be satisfied. The preaching department especially requires steadiness because preaching is so difficult, and of all the different types of preaching, book distribution requires the most steadiness. You must wait years before you become an expert. First you must meet many different kinds of people in many different circumstances, and then you must go on for the rest of your life, learning the art of surrender, which doesn't come cheaply. Every day you have to wake up and surrender. Therefore, steadiness is the most important quality of a devotee. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Will the results increase just by being steady? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Oh, are you worrying about your results? 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Not so much worried, but if the goal is to distribute as many books as one can… 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, distribute as much as you can, but when you start worrying about results, thinking that you should be number one, you are getting into trouble. Distribute out of love for the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa, without expectation of results. If they want, they can cause you to do seventy books a day, or if they want, they can cause you to do seven books a day. Become a tool in the hands of Kṛṣṇa, and do not consider whether you are going to distribute a lot or not. Every day you should think, “Let's see what Kṛṣṇa arranges today. Maybe Kṛṣṇa will arrange for me to meet nice people, or maybe for my purification, He will arrange that I meet nasty people. Let us see what Kṛṣṇa has in store for me today.”

You are not a fruitive actor. Kṛṣṇa says in <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>: <em>karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana</em>. You have a right to perform your <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service, but you don't have a right to enjoy the results of your service. Leave the results up to Kṛṣṇa and don't be attached to not doing your service. Of course, if you are never doing very much, that's also not good. That means something is wrong in the surrendering department. But don't give up, thinking that you cannot do very much anyway. You should go on and try to improve, but you should not be attached to the results. One attached to the results can only go on for a short time, maybe a year or two. If you are attached to the results, and the results and your expectation do not match, you will become discouraged, your results will dwindle even more, and you will fall down from the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> service. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes authorities push one to be fruitive. One hears, “Oh, how many are you going to do today?" If one isn't doing a steady amount of books in a year, they consider him to be in <em>māyā</em>. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The temple has economic requirements, and your responsibility to the temple is to try to do as much as you can. Becoming free from the fruits of your results doesn't mean that you become irresponsible. As long as the authorities are pushing, you should try to do your service up to standard.

I personally never push the book distributors to fulfill quotas. Transcendental competitions are better. The distributors do not compete for sense gratification or glorification, and they surrender to the service and distribute as much as they can to please Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master.

Since the authorities have opinions on how much you should do, you can tell them, “I'll try my best to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and not be a disturbance to the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission, but the results are up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not me. Let's see what happens.” I think they will accept that. After all, it is the duty of the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees to pass on to the authorities and others their realizations on how to work without fruitive results. Only the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees can understand that art well, because every day they have to meet good and rotten people on the street and be completely detached from how many books they are going to distribute.

If you distribute completely free from fruitive desires and your heart's only desire is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, then the books will start flying out of your hands, because you are not distributing anymore, Kṛṣṇa is. As long as you think that you are distributing the books, you are going to have a hard time. People will push you down, spit on you, or slap you in the face—and unless you are free from fruitive desires, you will fall apart.

If you want the books to go out of your hands in a transcendental way, you have to understand that it is all up to Kṛṣṇa and become a tool of the Supreme Lord. But that doesn't mean you have nothing to do with it. Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna: <em>mayaivaite nihatāḥ pūrvam eva nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin</em>. Kṛṣṇa called Arjuna “Savyasācī,” or one expert in shooting arrows. He said, “By My arrangement, these men are already put to death, so you can become but an instrument in the fight, O Savyasācī.” Although Kṛṣṇa used Arjuna's expertise to do a service in which the result was already fixed, that didn't mean Arjuna had nothing to do with it. He did, but his service was to be Kṛṣṇa's tool. As Kṛṣṇa's tool, you should do your best, but let Kṛṣṇa use you. That is the secret of success. You have the ability to distribute a book, so let Kṛṣṇa use your abilities as if you were an instrument in His hands.

Becoming the tool of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very difficult because the false ego is always telling us, “You are great. You are an important personality. You are going to distribute these books. You. You. You.” Others may drag you into this bodily conception of life too: "How many did you do today? You are really great!” A sure way to fall into <em>māyā</em> is to start believing what they say, instead of remembering that you are just a tool, an agency through which Lord Caitanya's mercy can work to distribute these books to the fallen souls and nothing more. You should never want to be anything more, because that's already the most exalted position in the universe. Arjuna was Kṛṣṇa's tool, and look what happened! He became the most exalted personality in all three worlds by destroying his opponents on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra; he is glorified to this day, five thousand years later. Similarly, you too can attain perfection in your service by becoming Kṛṣṇa's tool. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How do we become Kṛṣṇa's tool and go beyond the platform of false ego? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Becoming Kṛṣṇa's tool is not a "how can we” formula: “Take three cups of this, four cups of that, shake it well, and you become Kṛṣṇa's tool.” You have to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. You have to give up the feeling that you are the doer and accept within your heart that although you try your best, Kṛṣṇa is responsible for the results. After a while, you will realize, “Kṛṣṇa is doing it. I have no problems. I just go out, and Kṛṣṇa makes things happen as He always does.” Then you will never want to feel anything other than the ecstatic feeling of being a tool of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

sub=Kṛṣṇa Helps in Many Ways

<strong>Devotee:</strong> On the weekend we had a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> meeting. Different devotees spoke on the theme, “I am not the doer; everything is dependent on Kṛṣṇa.” One devotee made the point that in the material world, the Supersoul is controlling everything, including the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotee on the street, who mainly deals with the Supersoul.

But a devotee is not only dealing with the Supersoul. If we approach the Bhagavān feature of the Lord, then He will personally reciprocate, <em>ye yathā māṁ prapadyante</em>. Śrīla Prabhupāda also explains in the preface of <em>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, "The Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is already in charge of the maintenance of this creation by virtue of His plenary expansion, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, but this maintenance is not direct. However, when the Lord says that He takes charge of His pure devotee, He actually takes direct charge.”

Another devotee explained to me that Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravarti Ṭhākura's commentary on <em>Bhagavad-gītā 9.29</em> says that the first two lines relate to the Supersoul and the last two lines to Kṛṣṇa personally. Someone else said that the devotee doesn't carry the Supersoul in his heart, but Lord Caitanya Himself. So how far can we say that Kṛṣṇa personally takes charge? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> I think that all the comments made in your text are correct. The Supersoul is helping the devotee distribute books by telling the people to take them, Lord Caitanya is giving His mercy so that the people can take the books, and Kṛṣṇa is directly inspiring the devotee to distribute. All these forms of the Lord help the devotee in the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> mission.

sub=Fruitive Desire

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is the desire to increase book distribution scores for the pleasure of the spiritual master a fruitive desire? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The desire to satisfy the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa is a good desire, and to want to do it by distributing more books is also a good desire. You should always think, “I want to do more for their satisfaction,” but never be satisfied with the result. They are always asking you to do more. Śrīla Prabhupāda didn't say, “Just go out and do whatever you can.” He said, “Go out and double it.” This desire to double it is not fruitive, because it is a desire to please and satisfy the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. But if you want to do more so that you can come back and boast about how many books you have given out, then that desire is fruitive, because you are trying to be the enjoyer of the activity. You should pray to Kṛṣṇa to allow you to distribute many books for the satisfaction of your spiritual master. Then whatever you do will be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Although you may be a little frustrated that you cannot do more, you are pleasing the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa with your steady service, and you will get the mercy. It is not that the mercy only comes to one who does a thousand books a week. The mercy comes to everyone, whether one does a thousand books a week or a thousand books a month. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Can one safely say that unless one is free from fruitive desires, one cannot do large amounts of books? Sometimes somebody comes and does huge amounts of books and then suddenly goes away. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> One can do anything for a short time based on material energy, even distribute many books. But to continue having good results day in and day out for many years, one must be free from fruitive desire. A fruitive actor could not possibly maintain the service. Still a fruitive and attached person who does a lot in a short period will get some mercy. His wonderful service will be remembered in the future. In this lifetime or the next, he will get a good chance again and go back to Godhead.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Does one meet a lot of demons because one is fruitive? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It could just mean that there are a lot of demons in the world. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> But on some days, when one is somehow attached and is not in such a good state of consciousness, one meets nasty people. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> That's good, because if you met nice people in bad consciousness, you probably would waste the opportunity to give them a book or burn them out. Therefore, whenever you are in nasty consciousness, Kṛṣṇa sends you nasty people. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> In one lecture in Russia you said, "If you do a hundred books, then it's a hundred books. Whether you do it with good consciousness or not doesn't make any difference.” Could you please elaborate on that? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> On book distribution your consciousness is not the point. The point is that it is your service to get the books into the hands of the conditioned souls. Whether you feel good or bad about it is not the issue. To give out ten books and feel good is no big deal. Who cares whether you feel good or not? You are a preacher and a soldier. The soldiers on the battlefield may feel like hell, but that doesn't matter. The point is to go out and kill. The sergeant doesn't ask, “How do you feel today?" No, he says, “OK men, grab your guns. Let's go.” Similarly, the warriors on book distribution go out to distribute books, not to feel wonderful. However, if they keep going out, they naturally will feel blissful.

sub=Those Who Have Life Can Preach

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some book distributors begin to see their service as being the same every day. Why does one fall into such a mentality?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You fall into that mentality because every day on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> you are doing the same thing. You get up, chant your rounds, chant some <em>mantras</em>, eat some <em>prasādam</em>, pick up the books, put them in the bag, count them out, walk out the door, meet somebody, and say, “Hello.” So it is easy to fall into a rut and start to think that you are doing the same thing if you are not meditating on what you are doing and why you are doing it. As you are chanting your rounds, you can meditate on how you are distributing these books to please your spiritual master. Pleasing the spiritual master does not become routine. You will get a taste in spiritual life, begin to feel ecstatic within, and transcend the feeling that your service is repetitive.

Do you feel that you are in a rut when you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa every day? No. You feel it giving you transcendental life and inspiration. Similarly, after a day of book distribution, you feel enlivened. But sleep drags you into the mode of ignorance and you begin the morning on the mundane platform, thinking, "Oh, another day, another book.” Therefore you have to meditate on how this transcendental book distribution is giving you the "life" that you need in spiritual life. Otherwise, you would probably be back in the temple looking for a wife. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> I no longer seem to have enough energy to stay out on the street as I could before. Is this just the mind deterring me from surrendering? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> This question is best answered by you, not by me, but I can give you a hint. When you are very tired, or when the body lacks energy due to bad health, the mind will represent the body and say, “Don't go out so long, you are too weak.” But sometimes the mind, on its own, without being influenced by the body, says, "Oh, what is the use of all this? Why go out anyway?” There is a difference between the two. In the first case you are thinking, “This is a wonderful service. I want to do it, but somehow I am not getting it together.” In the second case you are thinking, "What is the use? Who cares? I don't want to do it.” In this second case, it is only the mind. But if you are having trouble performing devotional service because the body is weak, you should do something about it. Find a good doctor, get some medicine, and take some rest. Then, after the result has come, go back to your service. If the body is broken down completely, the mind may argue in both of the above-mentioned ways and the cause may be hard to distinguish. A sincere devotee will try to go on with his service, but the other devotees may notice that he is unable to perform his service because of weakness, and they may demand that he take care of himself.

Once Maṇidhara Prabhu came into my room in Schloss Rettershof. He was just talking nonsense. I kept looking at him as if he were mad. Since I could not understand one word he was saying, I asked him, “Do you feel all right?" After much extracting of information, I found out that he was sick. Although he had a high fever for the past three weeks, he kept pushing himself to go out on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, thinking it was <em>māyā</em> to stop. So I put him in jail. I forced him to go upstairs into a guest room and made him stay there. I locked the door and only opened it to supply him with <em>prasādam</em>. He begged, threatened, and pleaded with me to let him out, but I forced him to stay there until he got better. After that, he went out and did nicely.

sub=How Straightforward Should a Preacher Be?

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is the solution to problems with authorities, such as the police?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Problems on the street are usually either <em>māyā</em> trying to stop us or Kṛṣṇa testing our sincerity. Whatever the cause is, the solution is to increase our dependence on Kṛṣṇa and not get entangled with the material nature. In the mid-seventies the police in Germany were giving us trouble. We were trying to solve the problem by fighting legal battles, but things were not changing. I even arranged for the lawyer who had helped legalize book distribution in the United States airports to come to Germany. He made a thick book of plans on how to defeat the laws in Germany. I took one look at this book and knew that this was not the right way. Instead we just kept going and depended on Kṛṣṇa, and within two years, we had very little trouble with the police. The problems that had been an everyday occurrence were rarely experienced anymore. Still, that does not mean we should not try to legalize book distribution, because legalization makes distribution easier for the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees.

On the street you should be a perfect gentleman and not a disturbance. If you are pushy or if you try to cheat people, you will get bad reactions. For example, in the past some devotees used the "change-up" method. Once in 1976 or 1977, I was traveling from Germany and my plane had to make an emergency landing at the Chicago Airport. Since I was stranded there, I decided to take advantage of the situation. I had heard about some of the distribution methods being used in America, so I phoned up the president of the Chicago temple and asked him how I could find out what it was like to be "changed-up.” He told me to stand underneath the main departure and arrival board and look stupid. I disguised myself as an ordinary, spaced-out <em>karmī</em>, looking at the board. Within no time I got my wish fulfilled: a distributor girl approached me. As she tried to pin a flower on my shirt, she babbled some nonsense about collecting money for some cause. But I kept saying that I did not want to give her any money, so she asked me if I could change some small bills for a fifty-dollar-bill. Although the temple president had warned me that this would happen, I handed her a fifty-dollar-bill. She slowly gave back the change, one dollar here, five dollars there—until she got to about thirty dollars. Then she said, “Why don't we leave it at that, for charity?" and I said, “No, I don't want to give any charity.” Again, after another five dollars, she said, "Why don't we leave it at that?" and she started walking away, adding, “By the way, where are you from?” When I told her, “From the temple at Schloss Rettershof, Germany,” she gasped and froze in her tracks. “I'm Harikeśa Swami,” I said. "Give me back my fifty dollars.”

When I came back to Germany, I told the devotees that they should never, under any circumstances, cheat people. It is a horrible experience. We would rather distribute five hundred books less each week than make money by cheating. As soon as people realize that they have been cheated, they get angry and tell the police. They tell their friends and their family, and we become known as cheaters. Therefore we should distribute the books in a straightforward way, as gentlemen and ladies. Many points in our philosophy address topics that people are interested in. If we preach the philosophy directly, then problems with the police will gradually disappear. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Some devotees present the books in a way that does not seem so honest. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Lies are not needed. Tell people about the book. By explaining the books from a social, political, scientific, or economic angle, you attract the people to these books. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Among the <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees there are two opinions on how to distribute books. Some say that the people should be inspired to read the books and not feel cheated. Even if they don't take the book, they should be left with some sweet words. Others say that the most important thing is to just pump out the books, and it doesn't matter what people might think afterward. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> I personally would prefer that you present the books nicely and encourage the people to read them, which comes naturally when you present the books philosophically. We do not condemn giving out the books using a <em>mantra</em>, without caring what happens, but that kind of book distribution is not the best. It is better to have the people walk away thinking, “That was a nice person. Let me try to read this book." 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> The problem is the devotees think that if they present the books nicely, they cannot distribute so much, because it takes a little more time. It's also a different mood. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, it's more brahminical. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> People who have met an unfriendly devotee are often fried out. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The problem is that in big countries like Germany there are so many people that you might think, "Well, it doesn't matter if I fry out a couple hundred thousand people.” But in Switzerland there are not so many people, and the devotees have to present the books nicely. Therefore the people in Switzerland take sets of books, read the books, and approach the devotees to thank them for the books. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Not only do we preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but we also try to get <em>lakṣmī</em>. You mentioned that those in management positions sometimes have to be a little duplicitous, but that a preacher, a <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, should always be completely straightforward. Should we be completely “up front” when trying to get donations for books? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> “Up front” does not mean stupid. In a place where the people do not like Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, you do not pull off your hat, show your bald head, and shout, “I am a Hare Kṛṣṇa devotee! I have come to take <em>lakṣmi</em> from you! Please give it here!” They will throw you out the door. However, if you tell the people, “I'm trying to spread love of God” or “I'm trying to do something beneficial for human society," then you are following the brahminical principle, <em>satyaṁ bruyāt priyaṁ bruyāt</em>: “Truth should be spoken palatably, and unpalatable truth should not be spoken.” A person who cannot take Kṛṣṇa directly has to be given Kṛṣṇa in another way. You can give Kṛṣṇa consciousness in many ways. If you have a little expertise, you will not disturb the person. The point is to give him a book. If you tell him something about Kṛṣṇa and he says, “Kṛṣṇa, forget it!" and doesn't take a book, then you have ruined his opportunity. It's your duty to make a palatable presentation, so that he will take the book. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Maybe sometimes one has to admit that he is a Hare Kṛṣṇa. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You can do that. We are not afraid of admitting it. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How can one develop enough faith in the book to preach directly about the book or about Kṛṣṇa and His qualities? For example, one may be afraid of the directness of the cover of the book, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If you read and appreciate the books, you will have faith in them. When you have faith in the books, you can impart that faith to others. There were times when the devotees in Germany were also having negative feelings. In 1976, I printed one hundred thousand <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books. Although that is not a big number nowadays, at the time it was the biggest printing run ever done. Printings had been usually about five thousand books, and I printed one hundred thousand.

The devotees were coming to me shaking in their boots: “It says on the cover, <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead</em>. How can we distribute these books?" So I made fun of them. I said that when they handed the book to someone, they would try to cover up the title with their thumb, because they would not want anyone to see that it says "Kṛṣṇa" on the cover. When you are paranoid and you think it is bad, the person on the street will immediately sense that something is wrong and not take the book. But the same person will react differently when you are not hung up about the title and you go out with full faith, thinking, "This is a book about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and whoever reads this book will like it.” The German devotees had not been distributing many books, and all of a sudden they increased. After a week or two of preaching, our <em>saṅkīrtana</em> devotees sold all one hundred thousand <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books in a month or so. The change was due to the <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books alone. The devotees just went out and distributed like crazy, running around all day in complete ecstasy selling <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books.

You can tell people that the books contain stories from the Vedic literature about wonderful personalities from the past, stories that their children will also like. You have to have a positive attitude and put the book into the people's hands. Then, although they read, <em>Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead</em>, they will not think anything bad about it. Everything depends on your consciousness. Always think positively about these books, and that will rub off on the person you are distributing to. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> When we distribute books we often present them as yoga, meditation, or Indian culture. After some time we meet the same people again, and sometimes they are disappointed, because they found out from the first page that the book is about God and religion. How can we avoid disappointing the people in this way? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If you say “spiritual culture," "spiritual philosophy," or "spiritual knowledge,” they will not feel cheated, because you tell them “spiritual” right away. Our books are not religious. You should not use the word “religious.” You should use "spiritual” or “transcendental.” Then they cannot say you didn't tell them. You can say, “Of course the books are spiritual. Spirit comes from the Supreme Spirit in the spiritual world.” 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is it OK to say that we are students? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Yes, we are students. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> A <em>karmi</em> thinks that "students” means university students, which we are not; therefore they feel a little cheated. Would it be better to say monks or nuns? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> What is a monk? You can tell them, “We are <em>sādhus</em>." I used to distribute books in a way that you might consider strange. I presented Kṛṣṇa consciousness directly. People would just become hypnotized by what I was saying and take the book. Of course, we were only distributing the small paperback <em>Kṛṣṇa</em> books for a dollar. When I got bored with repeating the same words, I would say, “We are <em>sādhus</em>,” or, “We are the <em>taṭastha-śakti</em> of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” Amazingly, nobody objected. I sold the most on days when I was running from person to person, throwing books into their arms. People would buy them, but I don't know how. If someone asks me how I distributed books, I cannot precisely remember. Sometimes I used to say, “These books are fantastic. If you don't have any other book but this one, your life will be perfect. Just take it," and it would work.

Distributing books often has nothing to do with what you say but who you are. You can say exactly what a devotee who can distribute many books says, but when you say it the effect will be different. It is a question of personality. Some devotees have a personality that the people like, so they buy a book. The most important thing is to be natural. You should be well dressed, but don't try to put on an artificial show of who you are, who you think you are, or who you want the people to think you are. Just be yourself and be friendly. By being a friendly devotee, people will be attracted to you.

sub=Awakening Desire

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes people are not interested in the subject matter of the books. How is it possible to awaken their desire to take a book? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You have to awaken their desire little by little. For example, you can talk to them about specific problems in the material world. People like to talk about the ignorance that causes disturbances to the environment or problems such as wars and disasters. There are so many things you can talk about; it just takes practice to choose the right topic. Whether the person relates to these problems is not so important; the point is to lure him into a discussion and gradually swing the focus to the book. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> How does one deal with people who have heard negative news reports or propaganda about Kṛṣṇa consciousness? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Śrīla Prabhupāda said that any publicity is ultimately good. The people may have heard something that seems bad on the news, but when they see a devotee with a book, and he looks good and is friendly to them, they may remember that they heard something on the news, but it is no longer important. They may not even remember what they heard, and even if they do, you can change a negative impression into a positive one by being a friendly person. You should not worry too much about what people have heard on the news; meditating too much about such things will undermine your faith. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes one meets friendly people who do not want to take any books. Is it bad to feel sad and lament about this?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> A devotee laments when people don't take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but he doesn't lament for long. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> But why should it go on like that? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> The people do not take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness because they are in <em>māyā</em>, and it is our duty to try to get them out of <em>māyā</em>. Therefore you should think it unfortunate when you are not successful in bringing people out of <em>māyā</em>, but you should immediately snap out of your lamentation and move on, because to just stay there and feel sorry for yourself is sense gratification.

<strong>Devotee:</strong> We meet many people who have gotten Śrīla Prabhupāda's books and have tried to read them, but they could not understand a single word. Can you explain how they will be benefited?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Those persons are glorious, because they have tried to read the books. Even if they didn't understand anything, still they are purified. They may remain dull and foolish in this lifetime, but in the next lifetime they will get another chance to study <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em> or <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em> with more facility. You have given them the greatest help—long-range help—and you should never feel that they are not benefited. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> If people don't understand what they are reading, how will the books change society?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Only the grossest people do not understand what they read. Change will develop gradually. The books will be handed down to the younger generation, who will understand what they read, and who will be able to change. We just keep distributing the books. We don't know who is going to read them or what is going to happen. Maybe the person who buys the book cannot understand anything he reads, but then he dies and his son becomes attracted and reads the book.

The books travel all over the world. Devotees have joined in Germany or Scandinavia because of books they have received in Los Angeles or Chicago. These books are acting, but the change in society will take time. We should keep on pushing forward, and then one day, because of all these books, this huge cement structure created by the materialists, this big castle in the sky, will crack; as the Chinese proverb says, "Little drops of water on the rock make a big hole.”

sub=Dealing with Demons

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Sometimes on <em>saṅkīrtana</em> one may be preaching to a nonsense. How can one avoid losing one's temper and blaspheming him? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You have to understand what you are doing on <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. Your purpose is not to defeat the opposing party. Your purpose is to get a book into the hand of the person you are talking to. If you think that the person is a nonsense and there is no question of him taking a book, you should quickly move on to the next person. You don't get involved in trying to defeat him. What is the use of trying to fight with someone on the street? You will only get agitated and fall into the mode of passion. Then, because you are disturbed, you will not be able to distribute anything to the next person. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What should we do when demons harass us? Sometimes they even follow us if we change to another place. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It's up to you. If you are a big guy, you might smash him in the nose — ultimately that is what a demon understands. But then you will get into trouble with the police, because he will go to them and complain. Or you can just threaten to hit him in the nose. Maṇidhara Prabhu was expert at dealing with demons. Sometimes he would fall down on the ground, take hold of their feet, and beg them to go somewhere else. He made them so amazed and embarrassed that they would do as he asked.

sub=Practical Questions

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Since devotees also want to distribute longer on Ekādaśī during the marathon, is it OK to then chant only sixteen rounds instead of twenty-five? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Śrīla Prabhupāda once said that if you are on marathon or something similar, it is all right to chant only sixteen rounds on Ekādaśī, because sixteen rounds is the standard he originally established. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> Is it better to distribute books in Vaiṣṇava dress or in <em>karmi</em> clothes? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Distributing in Vaiṣṇava clothes is good because people will understand what they are getting, but you can wear nondevotional clothes if it helps you get a better result. Śrīla Prabhupāda approved both methods. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> To what degree should the devotees use materialistic sales techniques, such as wearing a suit and tie, in dealing with the public?

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You should not be artificial. Wouldn't it be artificial to put yourself in a suit? You would feel like a penguin. You can try it and see what happens. If you predominantly approach older people, then they will think, “Oh, he is nicely dressed; let me hear what he has to say.” But we would like to get the books to the younger people, and they would think that you are weird. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> While distributing books, can we ask for donations to maintain ourselves and our families? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> It depends on what you say. You cannot ask for a donation for food relief or for the temple and use it for yourself. Then you are cheating and you will get into trouble spiritually, and it will also get the movement in trouble. It is more acceptable to tell people frankly, "I'm a monk, and I have no means of support, so any donation that you could give would help me.” Asking for extra donations for your personal maintenance is not required. It disturbs the people, and it doesn't mix together with book distribution. By selling books you will automatically maintain yourself.

To maintain your family by distributing books is wonderful. The temple managers should help householders to maintain their families by book distribution. If they were living in the temple, the temple would have to maintain them. To spare themselves this unwanted expense, the temple authorities should be liberal enough to give the householders enough of a percentage of the profit to maintain their families by book distribution. Śrīla Prabhupāda wanted the householders to support themselves by distributing books and running restaurants. I take on my head the dust of the feet of any householder supporting himself by distributing books.

sub=Saṅkīrtana for Life

<strong>Devotee:</strong> You always speak about the ecstasy of book distribution, but I don't experience this ecstasy when I go out. 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> You must taste something, otherwise how could you keep going out day after day as you are doing? Maybe the ecstasy does not pick you up and throw you down on the street, but it is a soft ecstasy that inspires you to continue distributing books. It is not an ecstasy that causes you to scream, pull out your hair, and go mad, but it is a subtle experience of satisfaction.

In the material world there is no such experience of ecstasy. There is only black or white. When materialists get together, they go from laughing hysterically one minute to complete dejection the next. But devotees are always on a steady platform of bliss. Steadiness is the beginning stage of transcendental ecstasy. This steadiness will eventually lead you to <em>bhāva</em> and then to <em>prema</em>. One day, in the middle of a <em>kīrtana</em>, you will realize that you are not your body but a spirit soul. You will chant in ecstasy, jump in the air, twirl around, and chant, “Hari bol!” When you experience that great ecstasy and you are enlivened in transcendental realization, run into my room and touch me on the head and bless me, so that I can taste the ecstasy too. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What is fanaticism? What does it mean to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> fanatic? Is it good to be a <em>saṅkīrtana</em> fanatic? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> Fanaticism is doing something blindly without any knowledge or concern for what other people think.

Book distribution is not fanaticism, and book distribution fanatics are not fanatics. They simply want to distribute books and nothing else. They are the most intelligent people, because they have dedicated their lives one hundred percent to the distribution of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. Therefore we lovingly refer to them as fanatics. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What special qualities does one need to distribute books for the rest of one's life? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> If you simply want to distribute books for the rest of your life, all the qualities that you need will come automatically. You may not be on the street forever. You might be inspiring and assisting others to distribute more; you might be making more new distributors. Thus your whole life would be devoted to book distribution. I personally wouldn't mind if everybody were just distributing books; I would go from one traveling party to another and have an enormously good time. But we also have to publish books, and publishing books demands time and energy. Other problems, such as family life and big temples, also demand time and energy. There has to be a place for everyone in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because not everyone will go out and distribute books. But from our point of view, we would love it if there was only book distribution. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What will happen to book distribution in the future, when everybody already has all the books? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> In the future we will also distribute books. We will distribute until everyone in the world has a full set of books. Then we will start to distribute spare sets, in case they lose the books or their dog eats them. Unlimited amounts of books can be distributed. Don't think that soon everybody will have books; it will take at least a hundred years. And besides, books don't last forever, so we have to distribute new ones too. 

<strong>Devotee:</strong> What will we do when everyone in the world has a <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>? 

<strong>Harikeśa Swami:</strong> What a terrible problem! You will go to every door and teach the people what it says in the <em>Bhagavad-gītā</em>. You will give them <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, and when they all have <em>Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</em>, you will give them the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>. When everyone is finished reading the <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, we will have a billion-person <em>kīrtana</em> and this earth planet will float right out of the universe.
