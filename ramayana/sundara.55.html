<h3>Book V : Sundara Kanda - Book Of Beauty</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 55<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">ṃaking out that the whole of Lanka is reduced to ashes and conjecturing that Seetha too 
thus might have lost her life, Hanuma begins to reproach himself for his unrestrained exhibition of 
anger. Hanuma regrets that if Seetha dies now in this fire of Lanka, Rama and his brothers on hearing 
that report will not survive. While reflecting thus, Hanuma sees some good omens and asserts himself 
that Seetha can survive from the harsh forces of fire by her virtues of penance and devotion to Rama. 
In the meantime, he hears of her safety from the lips of charanas (celestial bards) and feels consoled. 
Hanuma makes up his mind to return only after seeing her again.</p>
