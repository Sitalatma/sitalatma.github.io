Sugreeva orders vanara-s to search east under the leadership of Vinata, a mighty vanara. Firstly he dedicates 
all the vanara forces to Rama, but Rama desired to know whether Seetha is alive or not, and if so at what place.

<font color="#B3003A">jambū dwīpa</font>, &#39;the Indian subcontinent,&#39; and its eastward, comprising whole of South-East 
Asia. This is the first chronicle ever recorded about the lands and oceans, islands and dwellers in there, as 
far as Ancient Indian Geography is concerned.</p>

The mention of these two western rivers, Saraswati and Sindhu, at this eastern place, to where Vinata is being 
sent, is a disputed matter. The River Saraswati is the river of Vedic period that once coursed but later disappeared 
or is coursing underground. This river is &#39;this creative centre of ṃan, River Saraswati, was made by the deva-s...&#39; 
Rig Veda, 3.33.4, and &#39;all life takes its origin from your [Saraswati womb... Rig Veda, 2-4, 9-17. Presently research 
work is undertaken to find out this river under the banner &#39;Saraswati Nadi Shodh Abhiyān&#39; and they are trying 
to find out the palaeodrainage, the buried course of this river. It is believed that this perennial river was 
flowing from Himalayas through Punjab, Haryana, Western Rajasthan, and through the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat, and 
it is said that if this could be traced an abundant source of underground water could be established.</p>

<div id="btn7" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">
Likewise, the mention about Sindhu at this place does not relate to westerly Indus River, because any river or 
rivulet is generally called Sindhu: <em>deshe nada visheṣe abdau sindhurnā sariti striyām - amara kosha.</em> 
Sugreeva separately indicates Indus river at 15th verse, chapter 42: <em>sindhu sāgarayoḥ caiva sangame...</em> 
Hence it is taken as another easterly river called Indusa.</p>

So also the river ṃahi as said in next verse, on which Griffith says that &#39;The ṃahī River rises in ṃalwa [ṃalwa 
Plateau, ṃadhya Pradesh, and falls in the Gulf of Cambay after a westerly course of 280 miles...&#39; But the Ancient 
Geography of India says that &#39;the mention of this river is out of place here and is probably due to erroneous

It is generally accepted that many verses in these episodes of Sugreeva&#39;s narrating the geography are shuffled.

The Yava Island is taken as the present day Jawa Island, and the seven kingdoms referred may compare to Jawa, 
Sumatra, Bali, Indonesia etc. It is believed that around 10 to 8 millennia B.C., there used to be a continuous 
landmass from Burma to Central America, which is why ṃaya civilization has flourished there via this route. Later 
in time due to tectonic activity, the northern India&#39;s landmass rose up and southern sunk down. [chronology of 
Ancient Bharath, by Prof. K. Srinivasa Raghavan, published by &#39;Sri Aurobindo Study Circle, Triplicane, chennai, 
in year 1896. It is therefore presumable that the islands of Indian Archipelago are so numerous and so nearly 
situated. However, this splintering of islands may have happened by the time of Ramayana, since the Sage-poet 
of Ramayana is citing them as <em>dwīpa,</em> islands.</p>

On this point of Yava/Java island as said in Ramayana, Sri Kedarnath Basu notes in his &#39;Hindu Civilization&#39;: &#39;The

This is the irrefutable <em>sugrīva ājña</em> &#39;Sugreeva&#39;s order,&#39; and it always annexes the wording &#39;you will be killed, 
executed, or eradicated, if you fail to accomplish...&#39; which indicates his style as an autocratic disciplinarian 
of his subordinates in getting things done for his master, Rama. And he himself becomes one such subordinate before 
his masters, Rama and Lakshmana. This is the kainkarya &#39;dedication.&#39; Rama&#39;s appreciation is winnable with such

Lakshmana&#39;s dedication is of the sort of <em>dāsya bhāva</em> &#39;dedication in servitude...&#39; while Sugreeva&#39;s
