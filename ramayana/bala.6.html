			<p class="comment">
			The donations received by Vedic scholars are not alms to beggars or charities 
			to the destitute. The Vedic scholars do not receive them from anybody or everybody. 
			There are set rules to accept such donations like cows, gold coins, villages, 
			temples etc., from a befitting hand. Otherwise, the recipient is destined to go 
			to Hell for having received greedily. Thus, if ever somebody wants to donate to 
			such a scholar he should first notify his bona fides, which are verifiable by 
			the recipient. Another kind of donation is referred here as <em>dāna adhyana</em>, 
			meaning that these scholars while receiving donations from a righteous source, 
			they also have to donate something to others. It is the education in Veda, which 
			they have to impart to their students free of any charge and that too, to the 
			befitting students only. Thus, the words, <em>dāna</em> and <em>pratigrahaṇa</em> 
			mean all these rules to accept a donation or to accord it.</p>

			&nbsp;Sometime back, say during 1985-87, the 
			National Geography magazine contained a beautiful article under the heading &quot;
			<em>IRAQ, the crucible of civilisation</em> ,&quot; ṃerle Severy, as its Asst. Editor. 
			In its carefully worded introduction, it is stated that Iraq is &quot;<em>the traditional 
			birthplace of man for Jews, christians and ṃuslims...</em> &quot; On the other hand, 
			Hindus naturally believe that the Southward Himalayan region is the birthplace 
			of man. In the same article, the regions around Euphrates and Tigris are said 
			to be the &quot;<em>Fertile Crescent, the cradle of Western civilization ... in the 
			third millennium BC</em> &quot;. Further that &quot; <em>To the east a similar florescence 
			occurred in the Indus and Yellow River Valleys...</em> &quot; This florescence in Indus 
			Valley and far eastward did not occur later to ṃesopotamian or Babylonian civilisations 
			but flourished much earlier, as per Hindu scripts and the dating of which is the 
			eternal question like Aryan Question. However, Hindu scripts centre the present 
			world, Bhūloka, surrounding ṃeru ṃountain and its geography includes the land 
			unto Rome, Russia, china. We will refer to ṃeru mountain-oriented geography and 
			its geographical account at the appropriate place. Since Ramayana dates back to 
			Buddhism and Buddhism&#39;s westward spread is unto Afghanistan, the Kings of Ramayana 
			must have had no problem to draft horses from Persian, Arabian or the other of 
			ṃiddle East countries. These countries are always famous for horse breeding, right 
			from the days of Ramayana to ṃoses. Hence the accounts of horses and the countries 
			from where they are brought may be treated as cross-continental culture. Since 
			history believes only in the unearthed iconography and the epics or their content 
			can not stand to the carbon-testing, the countries named here as Kambhoja, Bāhlika 
			may nearly mean Babylonian, ṃesopotamian, Arabian or other unknown or unearthed 
			historic countries of the crucible of Western civilisation, Iraq. Vanāyu, another 
			country referred may nearly mean Roman, as Persians term Greeks as Unani in India, 
			advent to the arrival of Alexander, the Great. We still have an herbal medication 
			called Unani, a hybrid between Ayurveda, Greek and Persian herbal treatments.</p>

			The <em>bhadra</em> is the elephant class for King&#39;s ride, called <em>bhadra gaja</em> 
			. It is a state elephant with high honors and for occasional or ceremonial use.
			<em>mandra</em> and <em>mṛiga</em> are classes of breed tamed and used in wars
