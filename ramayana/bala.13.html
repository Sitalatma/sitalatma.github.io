			the Vedic ritual. Sage Vashishta instructs all the concerned about the discipline 
			to be observed in executing the works. Sage Vashishta also instructs the minister

			A detailed description of the components of Vedic ritual hall is given at the 
			endnote of next chapter, wherein King Dasharatha enters. Vedic ritual cannot be 
			performed in ordinary households or in small temples. A very large place is selected, 
			as per architectural science, and at its centre a <em>homa kunda</em>, an altar 
			of fire will be constructed. This area will not have any roofing so as to let 
			the vapours of oblations of ghee, sandalwood paste and others offered into the 
			fire of altar, get into the atmosphere and thereby to Heavens. Around this altar 
			of fire, huge sheds will be constructed to accommodate thousands of participants 
			and onlookers. Apart from this, mammoth kitchens and dining halls are to be constructed 
			as all of the thousands of participants, who are to be fed as long as ritual is 
			conducted. Some of the many tradesmen are listed in a bird&#39;s eye view as above.</p>
