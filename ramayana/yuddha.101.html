<h3>Book  VI : Yuddha Kanda - Book Of War</h3>
<h3>chapter [Sarga] 101<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama laments over the uncertain condition of Lakshmana. He calls Sushena, the monkey-physician. Sushena tests Lakshmana and says he is
still alive. Sushena then requests Hanuma to go all the way to Himalayas and bring the required herbs to treat Lakshmana. Hanuma proceeds to ṃount
ṃahodara and failing to identify the herbs there, carries the mountain-peak itself and brings it to Sushena. Lakshmana regains consciousness, after
getting treated with that herb by Sushena.</p>
