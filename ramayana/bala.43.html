<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p class="txt">
			Ganga descends to earth by the extraordinary effort of Bhageeratha. 
			Shiva agrees to the alighting of Ganga on His head and from where she 
			is released into a lake called Bindusarovar, and from there she flows 
			in seven courses. On land Bhageeratha ushers her up to netherworld dug 
			by his ancestors where heaps of ashes of his grandparents are there, 
			and she enters accordingly to inundate those mounds of ashes according 
			salvation to the souls.</p>

			earth. [1-43-1]</p>

			<p class="comment">
			Bhageeratha stood on one big-toe with an unwavering intent and bodily 
			movement, and with his hands upraised in prayer for a period of one 
			year by day and night, sustaining himself on mere air, and thus his 
			yogic concentration increased and that alone pressurised the earth.</p>

			The River Ganga is also called as <em>tri patha gā</em> &#39;she courses
