<h3>chapter[Sarga] 74<br>
Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p class="txt">Bharata censures Kaikeyi saying that because of her, Dasaratha is dead and Rama is sent to exile. He abuses his mother of her greed
for the kingdom and the misfortune thus brought to Kausalya, Sumitra and other mothers because of his father's death and brother's exile to the
forest. He compares the grief of the Kausalya with the grief of Kamadhenu the mythical cow who was aggrieved of a pair of bullocks (her sons) being
harassed by a plough -man. Bharata then promises that he would bring Rama back to Ayodhya and make him as a king.</p>
