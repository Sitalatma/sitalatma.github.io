Verses converted to UṭF-8, Nov 09</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="txt">Rama bewails for Seetha as an ambivert, ambivalent romantic epical hero and asks Lakshmana to return to Ayodhya, as Rama is certain to
perish without Seetha. He thinks his agony aloud, weighing pros and cons of his situation.</p>

<em>rāmaḥ</em> = Rama; <em>sītām a pashyan</em> = ṣeetha, not, being able to see; <em>shoka upahata cetanaḥ</em> = anguish, marred, sagacity;
<em>vilalāpa</em> = bewailed.</p>
<p class="tat">
In not seeing Seetha that virtue-souled Rama's sagacity is marred by his anguish and he bewailed with his lotus-like eyes that are
reddening like a pair of lotuses, raising is long arms. [3-62-1]</p>
<div id="btn0" class="toggle" onclick="togglejs(this.id)"><span class="stretch">▼</span></div><p class="comment">Some mms use the word <em>kāma</em> in the compound <em>shoka upahata
cetanaḥ</em> thus it becomes <em>kāma upahata cetana</em> and then it means 'his sagacity is
marred by desire for Seetha...' and because of the adjacency of word <em>dharmātmā</em>
'righteous one...' 'a righteous desire is no sin to desire for... hence his desire for Seetha is
righteous...' Then <em>mahābāhū</em> denotes that he is wailing raising his long arms, and
<em>kamala locana</em> is indicative of redness of lotuses, thus his eyes are reddening by his
wailing.</p>

<p class="tat">
Even if Raghava is not able to see Seetha in his presence he started talking to her in a kind of inarticulate wailing, as wailing
pampered his articulacy because his speech took shelter of wailing instinct, and as he is cowed down by Love-god, and thus he started to vent out his
heart in this way. [3-62-2]</p>

<em>20. dīnaḥ</em> = dejected one; <em>rāghavaḥ</em> = Raghava; <em>vanam upagamya</em> = forest, on nearing [searchingly he
neared every corner of forest]; <em>su keshyā</em> = with good, tresses - lady with best hair-locks; <em>tayā vinā</em> = her, without - missing
from him; <em>iti vilapati</em> = thus, bewailing; <em>lakshmaṇaḥ api</em> = Lakshmana, even; <em>bhaya vi kala mukhaḥ</em> = by fear, without,
lustre, faced [whey-faced]; <em>vyathita manā</em> = frantic, hearted; <em>bhṛisham āturaḥ babhūva</em> = highly, overwrought, he became.</p>
<p class="tat">
Thus Raghava, the dejected, neared every corner of the forest in his search, and bewailed because that lady with best plaits, Seetha,
is not found and missing from him. Even Lakshmana became whey-faced, frantic-hearted, highly overwrought, by the fear of uncertainty looming large on
them. [3-62-20]</p>
